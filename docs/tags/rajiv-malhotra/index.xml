      <title>Westology and its nonsense</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What is the logic of &lt;a href=&#34;https://yogirk.github.io/hipkapi/posts/why-study-the-western-culture/&#34;&gt;my argument&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;? Am I proposing a &amp;lsquo;westology&amp;rsquo;? Let me briefly explicate my stances, beginning with the last question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If we are not to simply sell slogans and our claims should carry bite, we need to say what this &amp;lsquo;westology&amp;rsquo; is or could be. My stance: such a &amp;lsquo;westology&amp;rsquo; cannot even be properly conceptualized, let alone carried out.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1.1. What does it mean (however intuitively plausible it might appear at first sight) to build a &amp;lsquo;westology&amp;rsquo; that is, say, an Indian counterpart to &amp;lsquo;indology&amp;rsquo;? Are we to assume that we need to build &lt;em&gt;Indian&lt;/em&gt; theories of &amp;lsquo;democracy&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;state&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;market&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;firm&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;society&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;religion&amp;rsquo; and such like? If the answer is &amp;rsquo;no&amp;rsquo;, then the notion of &amp;lsquo;westology&amp;rsquo; does not make sense. Therefore, the answer has to be &amp;lsquo;yes&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why study the Western culture?</title>
      <link>https://yogirk.github.io/hipkapi/posts/why-study-the-western-culture/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Two substantial questions have been raised in response to &lt;a href=&#34;https://yogirk.github.io/hipkapi/posts/vacuity-of-intellectual-svaraj/&#34;&gt;what I wrote&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;: (a) why do we need to study and understand the Western culture in order to access our own traditions? (b) Is it my claim that Buddha and Shankara (for example) are irrelevant to us? One other sort of &amp;lsquo;objection&amp;rsquo; too has surfaced, albeit disguised as a characterization of what I have said: (c) is not my position itself illustrative of &amp;lsquo;Eurocentrism&amp;rsquo;? These issues are intertwined.  Hopefully, addressing them together will lend some clarity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>On Rajiv’s history-centrism—S.N.Balagangadhara</title>
      <link>https://yogirk.github.io/hipkapi/posts/on-rajivs-history-centrism-s-n-balagangadhara/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Can history-centrism &lt;em&gt;cause&lt;/em&gt; some religion or the other to be belief-based? The notion of &amp;ldquo;history-centrism&amp;rdquo; is too vague to allow a serious answer. In so far as this refers to a &amp;ldquo;Grand narrative&amp;rdquo;, and this narrative is either an oral or a written account, it is a &lt;em&gt;candidate&lt;/em&gt; for the status of &amp;lsquo;belief&amp;rsquo;. Consequently, your question takes the following form: &lt;em&gt;Does &amp;ldquo;believing in&amp;rdquo; the truth of some or another historical event cause a religion to base itself on &amp;ldquo;beliefs&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/em&gt; (The contrast term to &amp;ldquo;belief&amp;rdquo; will have to be attitude or action or event.) As Christians do, you might want to distinguish between &amp;ldquo;believing in&amp;rdquo; (a propositional attitude) and a set of &amp;ldquo;beliefs&amp;rdquo; (which are a set of propositions). In that case, the Christian stance is superior to your formulation: they say that &lt;em&gt;believing in&lt;/em&gt; God is primary with respect to the belief that &amp;ldquo;God exists&amp;rdquo; or that &amp;ldquo;Christ has come&amp;rdquo; or any such thing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why ‘Westology’ ala Indology doomed to fail?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;1.1. The inherent logic of such an enterprise forces one, as it were, to build &lt;em&gt;alternate&lt;/em&gt; theories to the existing, &amp;lsquo;western&amp;rsquo; theories. Instead of explaining this statement in the abstract, let me take a concrete example to illustrate what I mean.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1.2. In the University of Chicago, there is a certain Richard Shweder. He practices &amp;lsquo;Cultural Psychology&amp;rsquo;, and is (was?) professor of &amp;lsquo;Human Development&amp;rsquo;. He is rather well-known for his &amp;lsquo;cross-cultural&amp;rsquo; studies: he and his students have published many works comparing psychological developments across the two cultures that India and America are. (In fact, he received a medal from the American Association of the Advancement of Science, if I remember properly, for one of his articles: &amp;lsquo;Does the concept of the Person vary cross-culturally?&amp;rsquo; This was a study about the concept of &amp;lsquo;self&amp;rsquo; in the USA and Orissa, India.) A few years ago, he published a study on the nature of &lt;em&gt;moral development&lt;/em&gt; and the growth of moral awareness cross-culturally: again, India and the USA were the two compared cultures.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
