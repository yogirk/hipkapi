We will have on our hands a plethora of interpretations, many in conflict with the other, so that we cannot even decide whether there is even one or some interpretation(s) that is (are) better than the other. We end up formulating an impossible problem: which interpretation to choose and why? We cannot appeal to the implicit goal present in text interpretations, viz., consistency and completeness nor to criterion like coherence (because it is unclear what coherence would consist of in this case). Suppose that you ask the following question instead: which other texts (that is, con-texts) do we need to read and understand the two articles on relativity? We do need background knowledge to draw some possible implications from these articles, but what con-texts do we need? Which con-texts are needed to study Feynman’s Lectures, or Darwin’s origin or similar works in the natural sciences? Some knowledge is required; some skills are necessary; we must be able to read a natural language, etc., but these are not con-texts but requirements to acquire knowledge. Suppose further that you see the Gita as a text that imparts knowledge. (I will leave out the question what that knowledge could be.) Suppose too that there are prerequisites to acquire this knowledge, as is the case with knowledge. And that we can evaluate and judge the Gita as knowledge as well. Which insurmountable problem does such an approach create? One might not be able to read the Gita and acquire the knowledge it imparts by just knowing a natural language. However, that would apply to all knowledge, would it not? You will not understand the relativity theories just because you can read those articles in, say, the original or in a faithful translation. A popular commentary that ‘explains’ these papers will not make you a physicist either. What hinders us from looking at the Gita this way? What objections are there for such an approach? In fact, if you look at most claims made about the Gita (Sen, Doniger, Danto, etc.), you notice that they look at the Gita either as a literary text, or as a quasi-moral or philosophical text, or as a religious text etc. I have not come across a single interpretation of even the first chapter of the Gita that goes beyond these approaches and almost all of them tell the same story: Arjuna was despondent or felt extremely sad that he must kill (his relatives) on the battlefield and the 17 chapters of the Gita are there to ‘comfort’ him. How do they do so? The acts and consequences story is one answer. Here are my naïve questions: why write 17 chapters just to say ‘karmanyevadhikaraste…’? After all, this thought is exactly one verse long and, in fact, it is written out in the Gita. What do the other verses do? How, exactly, do these 17 chapters ‘comfort’ Arjuna and ‘therapeutically’ cure his despondency? I have not read anyone either raising these questions or answering them. (I confess that I have not read many commentaries. I am glad about this.) How does the fourth chapter (on Jnanyoga) answer any of the questions that Arjuna raises in the first chapter; what are the answers to those questions; and how exactly do these answers remove Arjuna’s despondency? Such and many other questions arise if and only if you do not see the Gita as a literary, moral, philosophical, or religious text. If you see it as a knowledge text, these and many more questions arise to which the Gita attempts to give an answer. If one takes such an approach, I see its con-text adding (in some of the Parvas) explications, clarifications and reasonings that are present in extremely abbreviated forms in the Gita.

An example of what it looks like.\nWhat did Islam do? It destroyed native intellectuals in India (the Guru’s, the prajnajivi’s) and replaced them with Pundits (as the Buddhijivi’s of India.) The colonial rule forced the culture to go into a defensive mode: protect, preserve, and transmit the traditions and not allow a disintegration of the culture. The pundits succeeded in doing this though their ‘shastric’ ways of teaching, which, among other things, consisted of building layers of walls that prevented the impingement of forces from the outside world. Neither of the two colonialisms destroyed our culture because of what our ancestors did and how our pundits conserved what they inherited.\nBut this conservation, which turns inwards in the process of protecting a culture, also inhibits emergence of novelties. All research introduces novelties and ‘the shastriya’ prevents this. While this was necessary during the colonial rule, today, it is a big hindrance. We need, to use a phrase current today, lateral insertion here: an insertion of questions and stories from the western intellectual traditions into a process of the shastric education that bows down to Saraswathi, the embodiment of knowledge. Without it, the ‘shastriya’ will go the way of all has been’s, sooner or later. The British colonial administration introduced its education system into this defensive attitude against the Islamic colonial aggression. It failed: not spectacularly but with a whimper. Our current education system sustains itself as a social parasite that generates more parasites upon the organism that our body politic is. When an organism is overwhelmed by parasites, the way it is today, the organism dies. So will the parasites. That is the future for India without changes.\nThe bureaucracy is a structure on which society has been built. If it is not destroyed, our society will disintegrate and fall apart. One cannot destroy a social structure through a ‘lateral entry’ of individuals and groups of individuals into that structure. It will absorb and crush such insertions in no time, as people are discovering only now. To use a biological metaphor, such a structure must be (a) destroyed through necrosis (by starving it of its lifeblood) and (b) by building an alternative structure at the same time (in the same pace) as the necrosis itself. As the corrupt and inept bureaucracy begins to die, a healthy and new structure must begin to take over the functions of holding the society together.\nTo understand how this is to be done, we need people who have made it their ‘job’ to study the structures and institutions in societies and cultures. Such people exist (a few in India but mostly abroad). We must draw in such people, make them do the research and feed their results to those capable of initiating such changes in the society. They exist too. The problem is to bring these people together, which, given the current state of Indian society, is next to impossible. We will continue to produce “mouse charmers” (instead of “snake charmers”) long after the world does not need people to write independent mouse drivers to use a mouse. Today, already, the OSes take care of using mouse to navigate. But we are still busy creating IT institutions that teach our students to write bad mouse drivers and shout about our “soft power”.\n","tags":[],"title":"Indian education system is a social parasite","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/indian-education-system-is-a-social-parasite/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","knowledge","bullshit","truth"],"content":"You raise the question whether using earlier theories, which are superseded by newer theories, one can (or even could ever) access knowledge? (I am not a physicist, but I do not think that physicists have junked Newtonian theories. I think that Newtonian physics retains its validity in the macroworld we live in and is not considered false. As far as I remember, I have not come across writings that claim that Newton’s theory is false but that most of its consequences (but not all) are derivable in Einsteinian theory, under some ‘limiting conditions’ (like mass remaining invariant, etc.) Anyway, I do not know enough Physics to enter a discussion about it. Arun and Kannan are more competent here than I am.) If we do not get stuck on any one example, it appears to me that there are three questions here: (a) Could defective, incomplete, partial theories help us access knowledge?; (b) Could false, or partially false and partially true, theories help us access knowledge?; (c) Was knowledge ever accessed by past theories, which, as we know today, expressed ignorance?\nOne route (among many others) to tackle these questions is to treat them as separate (but dependent) questions; the other is to see them as different and independent questions belonging to different domains (epistemology, ontology, etc.); yet another route is setup a framework which sidesteps some unanswered problems that confront us in both these routes. I tend to take the third route. (Ashwin seems to prefer a route that I do not recognize, if I understand his posts correctly.) Which are those unanswerable problems I want to avoid? They are connected to the use of the predicates ‘true’ and ‘false’. Let me very, very briefly explain.\nWe have some understanding of what ‘truth’ and ‘falsity’ mean with respect to individual sentences in an interpreted language. Some philosophers have (rightly or wrongly) tried to extend this notion of truth (of sentences) to natural languages. Without seeking controversy here, let us assume that truth is a linguistic property of individual sentences (or the propositions they express). Theories are higher linguistic units. (Higher than individual sentences.) Even though we speak of true or false theories (I have done it very often and continue to do so), this talk creates huge issues. The problem is: are theories true and false the way individual sentences are? They could be if theories were ordered sets of sentences. (I have often used this formulation.) However, the only attempt to conceptualize theories as ordered sets of sentences that I know is by Stegmüller and it failed. The current mathematical set theories do not appear to work for theories. (I am talking about scientific theories, of course). So, the question remains unanswered: what kind of linguistic entities are theories? How, then, to speak of truth and falsity of theories? One approach, which has also failed, is to develop an ‘inductive logic’, a ‘logic of confirmation’, an understanding of ‘evidence’ etc. Some people are still trying to use and modify Bayesian probabilities to develop degrees of confirmation, robustness of evidence, etc. These are some issues if you want to take the route of ‘truth’ with respect to theories. Popper tried the route of falsity. (But because he could not leave ‘truth’ behind, he tried to develop the idea of ‘truth-like-ness’, verisimilitude as it is called.) This attempt has also gone nowhere. The reason for the failure of ‘falsification’ are many: one such is the nature of scientific theories and their predictions. Any hypothesis or theory relies on many ancillary hypotheses and a huge background set of theories and assumptions to make predictions. If any (or even some) turn out to be false we cannot localize falsity: is it the hypothesis, the ancillary theories or the background theories that is false? How to localize it? Called the Duhem-Quine thesis, it said that theories (consisting of the above three) face the tribunal of experience collectively. Thus, the idea of ‘falsity’ of theories confronts other kinds of problems than those that the ‘truth’ of theories confronts. Some thinkers took the route of suggesting that individual theories are never tested alone but that rival or competing theories, each with their own history, challenge each other. Such clusters have many names: research programmes, research traditions, etc. Some dropped the predicate ‘truth’ altogether while speaking about the progress of science and scientific theories. All such discussions were (are) based on serious studies in the history of sciences. They indicate the kind of issues you need to tackle if you tackle the questions you have raised in your mail. I cannot. Therefore, I have taken a different route that sidesteps some of these problems. I am in the process of dropping the notion of ‘truth’ and take the route taken by thinkers above in point 5. (In the meantime, I did some research into the history of ‘truth’ to find out why it has become so important in these discussions. This has convinced me that this notion should not be used either with respect to the world, as ‘facts’ that constitute the basic furniture of the world, or in relation to a theory.)\nThe chapter on bullshit (in ‘cultures differ…’) tells you that my distinction is between truth and knowledge. Presenting truth as knowledge is bullshit, as I see it. My use of ‘truth’ remains restricted to sentences. Knowledge can be expressed in sentences; knowledge can be accessed also through sentences. However, no combination of sentences (that we want to call a ‘theory’) is knowledge. Knowledge is always true (in the sense that it can be expressed only in true sentences) because I cannot make sense of a ‘false knowledge’. Not all true sentences is knowledge but sentences (or theories) are not the only means of accessing knowledge. When I use the words ‘theoretical’ and ‘practical’ knowledge today, I do not any more use them as different kinds of ‘knowledges’; I see them as different modes of accessing knowledge. I have also given up (after a very great deal of resistance) the idea that “science is the best example of knowledge we have”. Science (or scientific theories with their experiments) is not knowledge, but one of the better-known ways of accessing knowledge. Knowledge can be accessed or expressed in theories, actions, practices, etc., but none of these is an example of knowledge.\nBecause of this step, not only I can answer the question ‘what is knowledge’ but also why after more than 2000 years of investigation, we still do not know what knowledge is. An analogous situation exists with respect to science: histories, philosophies, psychologies, sociologies, anthropologies… of science, including science of science, have failed to tell us what science is. We really do not know what science is today. This failure too requires an explanation.\nThus, to answer your question from where I am currently: partial, defective, incomplete theories give a partial, defective and incomplete access to knowledge. False theories do express ignorance and they could either facilitate or hinder the emergence of knowledge in an individual. If they hinder, probably you are dealing with bullshit (i.e., truth parading as knowledge). On their own, theories are neither the means nor are they hindrances to access knowledge. Only in an individual does knowledge emerge (thus only an individual can access knowledge); but for this to happen that individual must be in a particular state, which is both physical and mental. Put in a banal form: you must undergo preparation if you want to acquire knowledge. (You cannot acquire knowledge of Einsteinian physics, if you have not put in the required effort and preparation.)\nThe framework and the story that outlines this route is planned as a chapter in the forthcoming book.\n","tags":[],"title":"Accessing knowledge through past theories","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/past-theories-and-knowledge/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","published","swarjyamag"],"content":"A three-part series by SN Balagangadhara\nWhat happened in Ayodhya: a pran prathistha, a consecration, or something else?\nWhat happened in Ayodhya: Mehta\u0026rsquo;s heroics, Varshney\u0026rsquo;s warning, and Palshikar\u0026rsquo;s guilt\nWhat happened in Ayodhya: what our intellectuals saw and yet did not know what they saw\nCombined version\nFrom Academia.edu: The Ayodhya Event: A Response to Some Newspaper Columns\nFrom Researchgate: The Ayodhya Event: A response to some newspaper columns\n","tags":[],"title":"What happened in Ayodhya?","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/what-happened-in-ayodhya/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","enlightenment"],"content":"I\nYou say: “\u0026lsquo;person + Indriya + Manas is the Bhokta\u0026rsquo; renders the sentence meaningless to me.” While that could be true, that sentence makes (and made) perfect sense to millions (over the last two millennia) on earth. Would it help if it read instead: “soul + Indriya + Manas is the Bhokta; ” or “my inner self + Indriya + Manas is the Bhokta” or “ the pudgala + Indriya + Manas is the Bhokta” or any such combination? If it does, then I do not see why ‘person’ would make the sentence meaningless; person is used as a synonym here. Moreover, if using ‘atman’ makes the sentence meaningful (irrespective of, as you put it, “whatever it be’), what is the problem if the word ‘person’ is used to translate ‘atman’? If the meaning problem re-emrges, it must lie in what you think the ‘person’ is, is it not? Are you raising a translation issue (how to translate dehinaH) here? It means ‘bodied’, ‘that which is bodied” (whatever that may be, to use your phrase). If you have knowledge of what ‘that’ (tat) is, you might say that it ‘has’ a body, it ‘possesses a body’, it ‘owns’ the body, it is ‘in’ the body, etc., depending on whether ‘thatness’ (tatva) is capable of ‘having’, or ‘owning’ or ‘possessing’ and is ‘indwelling’ and so on. As you can see, it is actually a knowledge issue about ‘tat’ (that) and ‘tatva’ (thatness). You can be a tatva darshi (one who has seen ‘thatness’) but yet not be a gyaani (i.e., not have the knowledge of what tatva is). In my talk that you refer to, I raise a question about a knowledge issue. Is atman ‘inside’ the body, i.e., does dehinaH mean ‘embodied’ or is it merely ‘the bodied’ in the second chapter of the Gita? II\nRegarding the Katha Upanishadic verse 1.3.3-4[1] : multiple ways of glossing that passage exist. Consider this simple version: Aatma( = Dehin) +Indriya+Manas = Bhokta. RHS says ‘the enjoyer’, which refers to an entire complex of the LHS (let us say) consisting of the ‘person’ that X or Y is, plus his/her sense organs, plus mind, plus whatever else you care to add (its past, genetic tendencies, proclivities and skills, etc.). What is the problem? If there is any, it arises from some strange assumption about what Krishna and Arjuna could refer to. Krishna plus his eyes (or his legs or his intestines, etc.) is Krishna. Why should this sentence create any problem of understanding? Krishna plus his wives or wealth remains Krishna too.(How many times have you not heard people exclaim, ‘after all these years, you have not changed and are still the same”, etc.? To parse it properly, one must put the ‘you’ on the LHS and RHS. Such sentences are not difficult to understand, are they?)\nPlease do not use the wood and fire analogy to claim that fire is “inside” the wooden sticks (in this age and time). If you do, a middle school kid can show that you are not making sense. There are more interesting ways of looking at the analogy.\nIII\nWhile I do understand your desire for enlightenment, assuming you are serious, I suggest that you put in the hard work required to acquire knowledge. In exactly the same way you cannot learn quantum gravity by reading a few sentences in an e-mail, you will learn nothing about ‘atman’, ‘Brahman’ etc., by reading a short post or two. Such exercises might help you get more followers on Twitter or Facebook because you can write ‘intelligent’ one-liners but it does no more.\nNote [1]:\nआत्मान्ँ रथिनं विद्धि शरीर्ँ रथमेव तु । बुद्धिं तु सारथिं विद्धि मनः प्रग्रहमेव च ।। 1.3.3 ।।\nइन्द्रियाणि हयानाहुर्विषया्ँ स्तेषु गोचरान् । आत्मेन्द्रियमनोयुक्तं भोक्तेत्याहुर्मनीषिणः ।। 1.3.4 ।।\nātmānam̐ rathinaṃ viddhi śarīram̐ rathameva tu | buddhiṃ tu sārathiṃ viddhi manaḥ pragrahameva ca || 3 ||\nindriyāṇi hayānāhurviṣayām̐ steṣu gocarān । ātmendriyamanoyuktaṃ bhoktetyāhurmanīṣiṇaḥ ॥ 4 ॥\n","tags":[],"title":"Pudgala","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/pudgala/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","basics","translation"],"content":" He says: \u0026ldquo;Doniger translates \u0026ldquo;dharma\u0026rdquo; as \u0026ldquo;religion\u0026rdquo;. Apparently, Indians should not criticize that because we know neither what the English word \u0026ldquo;religion\u0026rdquo; means nor do we know what \u0026ldquo;dharma\u0026rdquo; means because neither English nor Sanskrit is our mother tongue.\u0026rdquo; First of all I do not say or imply that Indians should not criticize the translation. I merely point out that (a) there is indeterminacy in translation across two languages and therefore (b) we can only make \u0026lsquo;qualitative\u0026rsquo; criticisms. That is to say, one must suggest how the word \u0026ldquo;Dharma\u0026rdquo; should be translated in all those different contexts that Doniger translates it as \u0026ldquo;Religion\u0026rdquo;. Otherwise, the criticism (\u0026ldquo;that it is not an \u0026lsquo;accurate\u0026rsquo; translation\u0026rdquo;) is bogus. Secondly, I did not say nor imply that wedo not know the meaning of \u0026ldquo;religion\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;dharma\u0026rdquo;. That is, I did not claim that these two words are just as intelligible to us as the words \u0026lsquo;pif-paf\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;paf-paf\u0026rsquo;. He further says: \u0026ldquo;We may have the word dharma in Hindi but it may mean something different in Sanskrit. Besides, both these words are ambiguous \u0026ndash;another reason we can\u0026rsquo;t criticize the translation since we don\u0026rsquo;t know all the shades of meaning of \u0026ldquo;religion\u0026rdquo; nor of \u0026ldquo;dharma\u0026rdquo;. Similarly when \u0026ldquo;brahmin\u0026rdquo; is translated as \u0026ldquo;priest.\u0026rdquo; Of course Doniger could have translated \u0026ldquo;dharma\u0026rdquo; as \u0026ldquo;perversion\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;brahmin\u0026rdquo; as \u0026ldquo;idiot\u0026rdquo; and since we don\u0026rsquo;t know what \u0026ldquo;perversion\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;idiot\u0026rdquo; mean either, we couldn\u0026rsquo;t really criticize that as well.\u0026rdquo; Again, I did not claim nor did I imply that we must know \u0026ldquo;all shades of meaning\u0026rdquo; (whatever that means in the present context) in order to translate. Nor does it follow from anything I have said that one could then use any word in one language to translate any word from another language. That there is indeterminacy of meaning in translation does not entail that one denies that words have meanings, surely. Words occur in a language and a language has rules, conventions, dictionaries, and such like. It has a syntax, semantics and pragmatics of communication. Who has denied this? Quine has not; nor have I. It is the linguistic convention to translate \u0026lsquo;dharma\u0026rsquo; as religion and \u0026lsquo;brahmin\u0026rsquo; as \u0026lsquo;priest\u0026rsquo;. One cannot fulminate against this centuries-old practice unless one comes up with alternatives and shows why the alternative is better than the centuries-old practice. Until such stage is reached, wisdom counsels us to keep quiet. To reach such a stage, it is not Sanskrit or English that one should study but the relevant phenomena in the world to build a theory about the phenomenon in question. The subsequent paragraph simply repeats the same misunderstanding without understanding my post. Of course, to understand my post and react to that, the presupposition is that one has read what linguists and philosophers of language have written about meaning and use. If one has not done this work, and has merely some vague common-sense ideas about translation, then one should have the minimal humility to keep quiet and not attack Doniger\u0026rsquo;s translation. This, then, is the \u0026ldquo;point of my argument\u0026rdquo;. Do not think that western intellectuals are idiots and imbeciles. Being an Indian and a native speaker of some Indian language does not give you some marvelous ability to criticize the western intellectuals based on your common-sense ideas about the world. People like Wendy have put in years of serious effort to learn languages and theories and if one wants to take them on, one must make sure that one is their intellectual match. And that requires years (if not decades) of dedicated work. That is the \u0026ldquo;point of my argument\u0026rdquo;.

You would be closer to the notion of ‘Adhyatma’ if you can also additionally guide such a process. Such guidance requires, of course, that there is some deep understanding of such transformative processes and their mechanisms. Yet, I would be hesitant to suggest that ‘spirituality’ translates ‘adhyatma’ or the other way round. From among the many reasons, I pick three: (a) because the weight of the word ‘spirituality’ is drawn from Christianity, i.e., the kind of transformative force on a human being that we have in mind is the work of the ‘holy spirit’, it would be inappropriate to translate ‘adhyatma’ as ‘spirituality’; (b) it is difficult to characterize the changes in human beings that we are talking about by using this word in Islam and Judaism as well. There is no ‘holy spirit’ in these two religions that does the work of the Trinitarian holy spirit; (c) since a ‘spiritual’ person is the result of the workings of the holy spirit, in the context of Adhyatma which insists that transformations are the results of human phenomena working on human beings, the use of this word would be inappropriate. Both the Christian and the Adhyatmic use militates against such a translation. In short, no, we should not translate ‘spirituality’ as ‘adhyatma’.\n","tags":[],"title":"Spirituality = Adhyatma?","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/spirituality-adhyatma/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","secularization"],"content":"The Ancient Romans spoke of ‘Peoples’ and ‘Nations’. They saw traditions making a group into a people and distinguishing people (and, sometimes, ‘nations’) from each other. Different peoples (distinguished from each other on the basis of ancestral traditions) could live together in a nation and a nation itself could host multiple peoples and traditions. Consequently, they did not see Christians as a people because they did not have ancestral traditions to follow. The Christians redefined what it is to be a people: they became a ‘communitas’ (a community) because of their ‘religio’. The Christians became a community because they were united “in God” and “in Christ”. They were united too in their “search for God”, which was what “conversio” (‘conversion’) meant to them. Christians were a ‘people’ now, a community that came into existence by their ‘unity in Christ’. The idea that individuals are “united” in “God and Christ” is what brings about a community and thus a people. This is a very Christian idea, which is based on the thought that individuals are united only in God. When secularized, it takes the shape of the idea that “a people” have a “common religion”. Or that every people is a people (or becomes one) because of religion. It is this direction that one will have to go. I am working this idea out (every now and then) in my attempt to build a foundation for a theory of comparative politics, where I contrast these Christain ideas with the Indian ones. II One is the meaning of ‘nation-state’, which is also abbreviated in colloquial use as ‘nation’. This picks out individual countries with physical borders that have sovereign states internally: U.S., India, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, etc are such nation-states. The second idea, which has a venerable history of more than 2000 years, is one which sees ‘nation’ as a ‘people’. In that sense the Jews are a ‘nation’ as are the Christians (as they saw themselves earlier and many, even now) and Muslims.

Here are some of the problems that have surfaced.\nDo (did) people in India believe that Ramayana is (was) a narration of \u0026lsquo;what really happened\u0026rsquo;? Even without specifying the \u0026lsquo;when\u0026rsquo; and the \u0026lsquo;where\u0026rsquo;, the answer is obvious: some (did) do; some (did) do not; some are agnostic. The question, however, is: What is the question about? What problem is it meant to solve? Does the answer I give solve any problem? If it does not, that shows that this is not the issue at stake. So, what is the issue then? Can we talk about truth in Fiction? (The example of Holmes.) Yes, we can and do so very regularly, not only in common parlance but also in literary studies. However, the issues are: how should we understand this way of talking (there is controversy about it) and why is this relevant to Ramayana? Did some Indians begin a discussion about the existence of Ramasethu and the temple of Rama in Ayodhya (of today) only relatively recently? Yes, I think so. I do not know of any discussion that occurred on this issue, say, a thousand years ago. Again, what is the problem? Did Indians have no notion of the \u0026rsquo;truth of Ramayana\u0026rsquo; before their contact with non-heathen cultures? This is an ill-formed question, as far as I am concerned, because it is unclear what counts as an answer. Equally, it is unclear what the question is about: (a) is it about the Indian notions of \u0026rsquo;truth\u0026rsquo;? (b) is it about the \u0026rsquo;truth\u0026rsquo; of historiography? (c) Is it about the relation between \u0026lsquo;belief about the truth of historiography\u0026rsquo; and the \u0026rsquo;truth of historiography\u0026rsquo; independent of people\u0026rsquo;s beliefs about its truth? These are merely some of the questions that have surfaced. May I request that we resume the threads with clear problem statements so that we can make some headway? II\nYou say that the Jain rewriting of Ramayana shows that they were \u0026ldquo;trying to write a more \u0026ldquo;historically accurate\u0026rdquo; Ramayana, and that Indians even \u0026ldquo;back then\u0026rdquo; saw the Ramayana as history\u0026rdquo;. I do not quite see how these conclusions follow.\n(a) Some Jain authors (the one you quote), quite obviously, did not agree with the ontology of Ramayana: they did not allow creatures (like Rakshasas and Vanaras) to populate their universe (of discourse) but chose, instead, to populate their universe only with human beings (and creatures like Indra). In conformity with this philosophical choice, they wrote more \u0026lsquo;plausible\u0026rsquo; stories (plausible to those who shared this ontology) that were humanly realizable. Once such a choice is made, all claims about non-existing creatures (according to that ontology) become false and, in this sense, lies. (b) From this, it does not follow either (i) that their stories were \u0026lsquo;historically more accurate\u0026rsquo; or that (b) Ramayana is \u0026lsquo;seen as history\u0026rsquo;. Their stories are also made-up (according to other ontologies, for instance) and lies because of that. (c) Such conclusions can follow if, and only if, a mere rewriting of some set of events and episodes just by calling an extant writing false guarantees that the rewriting is true. Or that a choice of some hybrid variety of common-sense ontology guarantees the truth of a text. Neither is the case. (d) Therefore, the dissent of Jain authors allows us to merely note that they disagreed with the ontology of Valmiki Ramayana and that their claims about falsehoods in Valmiki are logically necessary in light of their ontology. So, what is the debate about?\nIII\nJust one more observation on your post. One of the debates in the Indian traditions is about the kind of creatures that exist in the world and about the reality of what exists. The Jains, for instance, disagreed that the \u0026ldquo;deva\u0026rsquo;s\u0026rdquo; of other traditions (with the properties they were supposed to possess) existed in this world or were real. (Their so-called \u0026lsquo;atheism\u0026rsquo; is a result of this debate.) Consequently, when they call Valmiki Ramayana false, they are making claims about the logical falsehood. They did not, on the basis of some or another empirical enquiry, establish that Ravana was a vegetarian or that Rakshasas were human beings (in fact, in many parts of India, people believe that Ravana was both a Brahmin and a rakshasa at the same time) or that Rama was different from what Valmiki said he was. The same applies to Anjaneya: the claim of some or another author that he was a human being and was married does not either \u0026lsquo;prove\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;disprove\u0026rsquo; the claim of Valmiki.\nThus, if we want to use the Jain Ramayanas to claim that Indians were also doing \u0026lsquo;history\u0026rsquo;, we need to do more than show that they called Valmiki\u0026rsquo;s Ramayana false. They were speaking of logical (and thus contingent) falsehoods; they were not making contingent claims on the basis of empirical research. We need more logical acumen that what Romila Thapar displays, if we want to appeal to the Jain tradition which was far more logical than the set of intellectuals that the JNU has produced in the last 50 years or so.\n","tags":[],"title":"Ontology of Jain authors: Ramayana","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/ontology-of-jain-authors-ramayana/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","published","swarjyamag"],"content":"Part I, Part II, Part III , Part IV (Appeared on 04/13/2022 through 04/15/2022) S.N. Balagangadhara, emeritus professor at Ghent University, Belgium, has spent more than 40 years studying the science of cultures, especially Western culture, which was deeply influenced by Christianity, and how this framework was used to understand Indian culture, where it was a colonising power. In the process, our British colonial masters’ understanding of Indian traditions, religion and the ‘caste system’ impacted how we, the colonised, began to see ourselves even after 1947. His latest book, What Does It Mean To Be ‘Indian’?, written in collaboration with Sarika Rao, examines how the Islamic and British colonialisms interfered with our understanding of the world and experiences, thus leaving us with several unanswered questions on what it really means to be Indian in the twenty-first century. S.N. Balagangadhara’s books and essays include Cultures Differ Differently, Reconceptualizing Indian Studies, Do All Roads Lead to Jerusalem? The Making of Indian Religions(co-authored with Divya Jhingran), and The Heathen in His Blindness: Asia, The West, and the Dynamic of Religion. His students have explored his themes in another book, Western Foundations of The Caste System(edited by Martin Farek, Dunkin Jalki, Sufiya Pathan, and Prakash Shah). In a conversation with Dr Balagangadhara, both over email and in a face-to-face discussion over Zoom, Swarajya’s R Jagannathan discussed his book What does it mean to be ‘Indian’?, including the ideas contained in it, and areas for future research. The following is the first part of the Q\u0026amp;A with S.N. Balagangadhara. Swarajya: Does your book ‘What Does It mean to Be ‘Indian’?’ seek answers to the question “Who were we as a people before Islamic and British colonialism entered the picture?” **S N Balagangadhara:**No. *What Does It Mean to Be ‘Indian’?*does not speak of some pre-colonial, ‘pristine’ Indian culture. *What Does It Mean to Be ‘Indian’?*is about what it means to be a part of Indian culture in the twenty-first century. The two colonialisms are parts of our past; they cannot be undone or erased. Colonialisms happened and they impacted us. The goal is to understand how they did so and find ways of dealing with them. That is the reason I spend much time on issues like colonialism, culture, and experience. However, what the impacts of colonialisms were and how we responded to them are dependent on how we were as a culture. How the two colonialisms changed us depended on who we were (as a culture) before they colonised us. What Islam did to us is partially how we were before that event and British colonialism’s impact depended on what we had become before they colonised us. We were never passive victims; our culture defined (partially) what the colonisers were able to do. There is more research to be done, but thus far we know that colonialism creates colonial consciousness which impedes our access to experiences — not at a generic, abstract level but at an individual level. It is something that you and I, our parents, and our children have. It is important to reiterate that this book is not peddling cheap identity politics. As I explicitly say: “I do not plot cultural differences along geographical, or linguistic or religious lines. Thus, belonging to Indian culture is how we use or deal with the resources of socialization in India. This would mean that belonging to this or that religion does not differentiate people as members of a culture: one could belong to Indian culture whether a Jain, Buddhist, or a Hindu in exactly the same way a Christian or a Muslim is Indian. This accords with what we see in India: a Konkani-speaking Muslim in Mumbai is as much an Indian as a Kannada-speaking Christian in Mangalore, and as a Tamil-speaking Brahmin in Bangalore.” 2: You state that colonialism, apart from violence and subjugation, does things to your mind whereby you no longer have access to your own way of experiencing life through your own learnt cultural interpretations. You see everything through the lens provided by the coloniser. My question is: this seems to matter only if the process of colonisation is incomplete, that is we have been outwardly colonised and alienated from our culturally-embedded instincts, but still know that something is amiss about ourselves. But what if we were, say, fully colonised like the pagans of Europe by Christianity? Today’s Christians are all descendants of those early pagan communities, who now fully see their identities as Christian, not pagan. I mean: does colonisation and self-alienation matter only if we are half-colonised, where we still have memories of what we were earlier? The claim is notthat we are not accessing our own way of experience. Rather, we are not accessing our experience. Period. (Read the chapter “India and her Traditions: An Open letter to Jeffrey Kripal”, in my 2012 book, Reconceptualizing Indian Studies,to understand in an abbreviated form what it means to speak of accessing our experience.) Also, it is not true to say that we “see everything through the lens provided by the coloniser”. The lens that Indians use(d) is different from what the Africans or the Native Americans use(d), even though these people were also colonised. The lens we ‘use’ is ‘made in India’, even if the ‘technology’ is western. Further, the two processes, Christianisation and colonisation, should not get mixed up. Christianisation is the process of converting populations into Christianity. It is a massive socio-cultural process. The British colonised us but did not Christianise us. In fact, though some missionaries wanted it, the British did not even try to do this. According to some estimates, the Christianisation of Europe itself was only completed by the fifteenth century. In fact, according to me, the Protestant Reformation signaled that the Christianisation of Europe was completed by then. And we still don’t know why the Roman Empire fell, what happened to the pagans in Rome when Christianity emerged. I develop a partial hypothesis in the second chapter of my first book The Heathen in his Blindness… (1994). Other than that, here are some further thoughts: I think India was already a mature culture when it was colonised. Perhaps, a passing thought is required to say what I mean by a ‘mature’ culture here. The successful and complete Christianisation of (western) Europe can at least partially be connected to the native cultures that Christianity encountered when it went west of Rome to proselytise. In India, there was very little Semitic religions could offer that would trump what was already present: from the abstract Parabrahma to sophisticated literature, arts, and philosophy; from various types of rituals and traditions to a plurality of routes to ‘spirituality’. Such a culture could tame and absorb some of the tendencies of Semitic religions without being overwhelmed. Colonialism damaged our culture in the sense that it damaged the transmission of Indian culture and the formation of our intellectuals. Even in this process, Indian culture didn’t passively undergo the damage. In turn, it also impacted and changed those that entered it. Indian Islam and Indian Christianity are different from what they are in their native soil. Evangelical Christians and madrassas are trying to change this Christianity and Islam in India into something which they believe is ‘the template’ for these religions. Finally. At the stage our knowledge is in, we cannot speak of complete or incomplete colonialism because we have no metric using which we can measure either the degrees or the extent of colonialism. Conversion to Christianity did not make Indians either partially or completely colonial: The Church of South India (including the other dioceses that are conglomerated there) is not a colonising institution, even if colonialism established it (in some sense). Madras Christians are not really all that different culturally from Mudaliyars or other similar groups in Tamil Nadu. 3: Can you explain your statement that India was colonised first by a religion (Islam) and later by the British (but not Christianity). The latter is easily understood, since it involved subjugation and direct intervention in our civil and social lives, but how does one explain colonisation by a religion? Or is it that Islam first colonises the minds of its own faithful and then they do the rest? I have not gone into this question in the book because it requires that one understands my theory of religion and how a religion secularises itself. This is a very long topic. Thus, I can only say in this answer that the claim that Islam colonised us can be made intelligible and is defensible. It is not ‘easy’ to understand it because religion is not an easy phenomenon for us to understand. All you need to know at this stage is that while it is true that people subjugate people, so does a religion. The latter’s colonisation is an entirely different process from conversion into a religion. Colonising India is the secularising moment of Islam as a religion, but not in its phase of religious conversion. The British colonised us but not their Christianity (i.e., British colonialism was not aprocess of Christianisation), whereas it was not the Arabs or Persians who colonised us but Islam. The process of Islamificationwas carried out by a very weakly secularised religion. (Or) Islam secularises itself through Islamification whereas Christianity secularises itself in a de-Christianised form. These two processes, Christianisation and Islamification, are different in kind and these do not qualify as a process of religious conversioninto these religions. Superficially speaking, Islamification looks very much like religious conversion, but it is not. The violent subduing of socio-cultural phenomena and attempts to deform them make this phase (or aspect) of Islam different from religious conversion. Conversion is an individual religious process, whereas Islamification is a secularisation process at a social scale driven by violence. (I cannot explain these distinctions and thoughts here, in this answer, because it requires a very long explanation). 4: My own hunch is that British colonisation was built on top of Islam’s brutal and contemptuous regard for Indian culture. Thus, when the British came, many Indians were willing to see them as saviors from Islam’s brutalities. This made it easy for us to think that the way forward is to think like them. Raja Ram Mohan Roy, for example, wanted to model his Brahmo Samaj more or less like a Hindu version of Christianity…Your comment. My previous answer hints at a possible explanation of your hunch, viz., “Islam’s brutal and contemptuous regard for Indian culture”. Surely, we must explain this phenomenon: why should Islam, or any religion for that matter, regard a culture (any culture) brutally and contemptuously? Even the most ‘other-worldly’ orientation seeks music, hymns, and ennobling visualisations. That being the case, how to understand your hunch? Since you are not alone in thinking this, as scientists, we must come up with a plausible (and hopefully true) solution to the problem. Currently, I think I am very close to a satisfactory solution, which I have only hinted at in my previous answer. Many things emerge at the crossover points where religion and tradition meet and impact each other. Movements such as the Arya Samaj or Prarthana Samaj are some such. They modelled themselves on the Protestant Reformation (as Indians understood ‘reformation’, of course) with a goal to ‘reform’ Hinduism. The nature and tenor of the Protestant theologies which they encountered defined their themes and determined their responses. However, I do not think that Raja Ram Mohan Roy (and others) wanted to be like the Protestants because the British fought Islamic rulers. The reasons must be sought elsewhere and not in their possible individual psychologies, because it fails to explain why many other and different psychologies followed these movements. Surely, we cannot explain or understand the ‘popularity’ of Arya Samaj today by appealing to this psychological explanation. No matter how Indians looked at the British (as saviors or whatever), this attitude does not explain colonialism. In the South, for instance, Tipu Sultan, the ‘Tiger of Mysore’, is praised because he fought the British. Tipu was known as a very cruel king, but he is celebrated as the hero who resisted the British invasion. There is a ‘Tipu Sultan’ day, a festival day, that the Congress party introduced into the state. 5: You say that there is no such thing as Hinduism, but we can accept that there are Hindus of various kinds. In short, we are Hindus in a geographical-cultural sense, but there is no religion called Hinduism, which was the result of colonial understanding and interventions. Is this what you want to say? Balagangadhara: Science develops because it tries to understand phenomena in the world. Scientific progress happens when old theories are superseded by better theories. That is how we gain knowledge. Just because new scientific theories develop, it doesn’t mean that the phenomenon that they are talking about disappears. For example, the miasma theory of disease which was believed to be true for more than a millennium was superseded by the germ theory of disease. This does not mean that diseases or their causes disappeared. We just developed a better understanding of the phenomenon. ‘India has a native religion, and that religion is called Hinduism’ is one story about India and her culture. This story is 400 years old. I challenge that claim and show through scientific research that it is not correct. But because one hypothesis about India is replaced by another, it does not mean that Indians don’t exist or that Indian culture disappears. Do Hindus (as cultural groups) exist? Yes, and they are not geographical groups: Hindus exist as a group in many geographies and not only in what we call India. This is not a modern-day phenomenon: Hindus were known to exist in Jambudweepa, Gandhara, Khambhoja, etc., for instance. Are they Hindus because they are a part of Hinduism as a religion? My answer is no. This answer has nothing to do with how the Semitic religions ‘define’ religion. The question is: does Hinduism as a religion exist as a phenomenon in the world? My answer is no. However, whether Hinduism is a phenomenon in the world or not, this ‘fact’ is independent of the question what the word ‘religion’ means in our languages. 6: So, similarly, we can say that castes (or jatis) exist, but not a caste system. That there may be Brahmins, but Brahminism is a concoction. Absolutely. Jatis are social groups in Indian society. Social groups exist in all societies and in India these social groups are called ‘jatis’. Similar social groups that exist in societies are called differently in different parts of the world. It is as sensible to speak of ‘the caste system’ in India as it is to say that there is ‘the social group system’ in societies. Further, yes, Brahminism is an invention of western Indology. Indology which is fond of ‘-isms’ has created quite a few: Brahminism, Vedism, Hinduism, Buddhism, and so on. 7: Religion is difficult to define, but traditions, rituals and practices are clearer to acknowledge. Tradition needs no justification, unless it offends basic human good sense in this day and age. But is there a danger in reducing all of Indian knowledge, metaphysics, philosophy, spiritualism, even science, to just tradition and not call it a religion? After all, isn’t Hinduism partly a religion even as defined by the West? I will start with the simplest point first. As far the West is concerned, Hinduism is not ‘partly’ a religion: according to them, Hinduism is fully a religion. Period. The West is not denying that Hinduism is a religion. In fact, they have always claimed that it is. So, when Indians jump up and down and claim that they too have religion and that it is called ‘Hinduism’, Western commonsense and academia are in complete agreement. They don’t understand why Indians are proclaiming this very old consensus as though it is a revolutionary new discovery. Now, the second part of the answer. You say that “there is a danger of reducing” everything to “just tradition”. And that, surely, Hinduism is “at least partly a religion”. This issue is worth focusing on. The first thing to notice is that there is an anxiety involved in trying to identify Hinduism as a ‘religion’. The anxiety is not about understanding religion. The concern is also not to understand what ‘Hinduism’ is. The anxiety is in gaining agreement with the opinion that ‘Hinduism’ is a ‘religion’— at least ‘partly’. People don’t know why, but they are convinced that it is bad if someone says Hinduism is not a religion. Why? Where did this conviction come from that all human cultures must have religion, whether in primitive or in an advanced form, whether as a ‘natural religion’ or as ‘sophisticated spirituality’? One might tweak the definitions in any which way, but one wants to make sure that the result is that ‘all human cultures have religion’. This is something we must pause and look at. The idea that ‘religion is a cultural universal’ is a belief in Christianity and Islam. With the process of secularisation, this belief has spread into commonsense and social science. This belief has become so ‘obvious’ that we have an entire cottage industry studying the ‘evolutionary biological explanation for religion’. Therefore, I say that many social scientific insights are simply universalisations of the experiences of one culture, namely that of the West. The idea that ‘religion is universal’ is not only an obvious unquestioned ‘fact’ but to question it is also considered offensive. My first book (1994) looks at European culture, and the phenomenon of religion, and I develop a theory of religion. I show that what we do not have is a definitional problem. It is about developing a scientific theory of a phenomenon X and seeing whether other phenomena like H or P are also the same or not. The book also explains why the West thinks that religion is a cultural universal. The other thing to notice is that by identifying one phenomenon, we do not ‘reduce’ any other thing. Just because I say that the water you see in a desert is a ‘mirage’ and ‘not photosynthesis’, it does not mean that all kinds of other things ‘get reduced’ to mirage. Why would they? Likewise, just because I say that we have ‘tradition’ and ‘not religion’, everything cannot ‘get reduced’ to tradition. Philosophy, linguistics, grammar, psychology, science, medicine, etc. are other things and they don’t get reduced to religion or tradition. Religion is difficult to define as a word only when there is no theory of religion. The word is defined satisfactorily in a scientific theory of religion. Recognising some practices as ‘traditions’ (or as belonging to a tradition) does not make defining ‘tradition’ any less difficult. For that too, we need a good theory. 8: Would you call Buddhism or Jainism or Sikhism also traditions? Or do they pass muster as religions since they do have founders and a set of holy texts like Abrahamic religions? Is it the lack of a founder or “fundamentals” that provides a line separating a religion from just a tradition? I do not say that any phenomenon that has a founder and a set of holy texts is a religion. I do not say this because it is a bad argument: when we say that ‘Hinduism’ does not have holy books, a founder, etc., the only thing we can say is that ‘Hinduism’ is different from the Semitic religions in this respect. We cannot say that, therefore, it is not a religion. I have a hypothesis on what religion is (as a phenomenon in the world) and that is explained in my first book, The Heathen in His Blindness: Asia, the West and the Dynamic of Religion’. In one sentence, which is difficult to understand in such a brief form, “religion is an ‘explanatory intelligible account’ of the Cosmos and itself”. (This sentence can be read as a definition of religion, but it does not speak about churches, holy books, founders, dogmas, beliefs, etc.) ‘Buddhism’ was a discovery (actually, an invention) of the British. Sikhism is an emergence from the interaction of Indian traditions with Islam. Neither exists in the world as religions. These are Indian traditions. I have written on the difference between religion and tradition in my writings. One must understand these two phenomena separately to understand their relationship with each other. 9: You seem to want to give our colonisers the benefit of the doubt in terms of intentions. You broadly suggest that they defined us based on their own experiences with the way European Christian history evolved. So, it was natural for them to analyse us in the way they understood reality. But is this the whole story? Didn’t coloniality need them to actively promote internal antagonisms and widen the fault-lines inside India, so that they could rule us with very few people? Didn’t Pakistan, and the widening of the jati divide, serve their interests? The first sentence in the question captures a prevalent misunderstanding. It says that I speak of the ‘intentions’ of the colonisers. That is not the case. I am not interested in the intentions or the motivations of individual or even groups of Europeans. The reason I do not do that is because: (1) it is not correct to say intentions guide actions. Take the incessant excuse that people give of intended actions and their unintended consequences. I have different ideas about that, but I won’t go into that now. I tackle this issue a bit deeper in chapter 4 of the book Cultures Differ Differently (2022) or in the book ‘The Heathen\u0026hellip;’. (2) It is very difficult to find out the reasons for an action by a person. Most of the time, individuals themselves don’t know what their reasons are, or why they act the way they do. (3) One of the problems in tightly linking intentions to action is the fact that one and the same action (even a trivial action like opening a door) can be the result of many kinds of intentions (maybe the room is too cold or too warm, maybe I thought someone is standing at the door, maybe I think spies are listening in to my conversation, maybe there is too much cigarette smoke in the room…) Like with any person or group, multiple motivations and intentions in a mixed form are present at any given time. To try to crawl into the heads of earlier generations, especially centuries later, to find that which is inscrutable to themselves is to set myself to fail. Or worse, that is to present ignorance as knowledge which I call ‘bullshit’. What I do is to make intelligible the consistency and thus the pattern of what the Europeans said about us and how they behaved. My hypothesis is independent of individual psychological differences (because we speak of hundreds of thousands of different people); it does not change with the passage of time (because we speak of a time span of centuries); it does not depend on national borders or geography (after all, the Portuguese, the Dutch and the English belong to different countries); it does not depend on their political inclinations (Liberal or Conservative) or religious proclivities (whether Anglican, Protestant, Catholic). That is, I put the constraints and demands of science on the hypotheses that I formulate. If I do not do this, I am simply one more person expressing one more opinion. Discussing motivations, intentions and opinions is an endless process. Look at the number of books produced on colonialism. They have not helped us gain much of an understanding of the phenomenon of colonialism or its effects. A scientific hypothesis must make sense of a canonised Catholic priest like (Francis) Xavier and the low-life thugs who made up the mercenaries of the East India Company, as well as bureaucrats like Warren Hastings and Orientalists like William Jones. I find that my hypothesis does it. Whether they abhorred the Savages and wanted to convert them, or whether they were rapine looters who wanted to make money or power-hungry imperialists, their cultural background and their shared Christian framework provided them with certain ideas about human beings, the natural world, and the social world. They used these ideas to make sense of what they went through and encountered in their lives. This is what all human beings do. We use our repertoire to make sense of and deal with what we encounter. When Europeans landed on the coasts of Malabar and met Indians, their framework (their culture) provided them with ideas (resources) to make sense of what they saw. One example is the idea that ‘all cultures have religion’. This notion is never questioned, but different possible explanations are given to justify it. ‘False religion’, ‘primitive religion’, ‘magical thinking’, ‘a different kind of religion’, etc., are just the different forms that a justification takes depending on the fashions of the time. But the notion that is never questioned is whether ‘all cultures have religion’. I also don’t use words like coloniality and decoloniality in my book. That is another reason for confusion. These words are obfuscating jargon from post-colonialism and post-modernism. These are the worst intellectual products of the twentieth century. In intellectual circles, post-colonials are described as Jammergemeinschaft (in German): a community of whiners who do not contribute to knowledge. Post-modernism goes further and is openly inimical to knowledge. Unfortunately, both have become very widespread and influential. Thus, it is wise not to speak of ‘coloniality’ and ‘decoloniality’. To give a short answer: no, I am not giving our colonisers any benefit of doubt, nor am I being soft or apologetic about them. The only focus of my work is to develop scientific knowledge about human beings, culture, and society. A true science of the social. Of course, colonialism used many strategies to subjugate a people. This includes the ‘divide and rule’ policy, ‘exacerbating existing fault lines’ and so on. To speak of something (Pakistan, the jati divide, etc.) as furthering their ‘interests’, we first need to be able to say what those interests are: are we talking about interests (in the plural?) of the British people (of which period?), of the British Anglican Church, of the British Empire, of the East India Company, of the White Race…? Was this plurality of ‘interests’ ever in conflict with one another? If they were, whose or which ‘interests’ did the conflict serve? Which became victorious and why? You know, ‘interests’ is such a silly all-encompassing word that we can even say that everything the British did was in their ‘interest’. I would suggest that you think of an Indian linguistic equivalent for this word ‘interest’. You will then see how silly it is to speak of ‘interests’. ‘National security interests’, ‘national interests’, etc., are weasel words with no boundaries. Finally, let me formulate a question. True, the British came “with very few people”. We were servile: there too I agree. No question that we behaved like menial servants. But did the British ever “rule” us? Do we know what either the word means or what it indicates in the real world? This is a teasing question based on the results of my ongoing research. I hope to publish them soon. 10: Regarding itihasa and history, you clearly warn us not to take itihasa, which is about stories that may or may not have some history attached to them, as history. Itihasa is about our way of passing on cultural information as stories and may not be history. But why do you suggest that the absence of history writing in India and using itihasa as history are both colonialisms. After all, don’t we try to understand or deduce history from holy texts like the Rg Veda or even epics like the Mahabharata? How is this colonialism? I have written articles on the subject where this question is tackled. (I suggest using my academia.edu website page, which contains most of my writings.) However, I do not say that we can learn nothing about our past by studying the Vedas or Puranas. But I do say that historiography (the graphein of historia) is not our way of talking about the past. Itihasa does this job without being history. Using itihasa to understand our past is not an expression of a colonial attitude. Using itihasa as history is. 11: You make a very bold — even controversial — claim about truth and knowledge. That “knowledge trumps truth” in our culture. We have a goddess for knowledge, but not truth. For the Abrahamics, truth is revealed by their one and only ‘true God;, and hence they are more obsessed by truth than us. But our national motto says, “Satyamev Jayate” and Gandhi said his whole life was about experiments with truth. How do you explain this contradiction between what we really revere (knowledge) and what we have adopted as national mottos? My answer is colonial consciousness. We learn a way of talking and we use it. This way of talking is unconnected to our experience. We have adopted many things in the formation of the Indian nation-state which are strange. The entire Indian Constitution is an expression of that strangeness. A couple of other things. In Christianity, God is the truth; He does not merely reveal something called ‘the truth’. This truth is an ontological notion (i.e., it is about what there is or exists in the world), whereas the ‘truth’ as we use the word in India is semantic in nature. It is a linguistic property of sentences, mostly. I do not say that the true sentences that we talk and write are unimportant to us; I say that this truth-telling is subordinated to knowledge. Gandhi titles his book without knowing what he was talking about. (We must understand his educational and experiential backgrounds, both of which were colonial and Christian, to understand his obsession with ‘the’ truth.) How does one experiment with truth, or how many kinds of experiments can we do with it? What does such a formulation or such an activity mean? What kind of experiments can we indulge in? For instance, is lying an ‘experiment with truth’ or is it the opposite of truth-telling? Silly slogans should not replace serious thinking. About ‘Satyameva Jayate’: what does the ‘victory’ of truth mean? Against what? Lies? Why should truth-telling and lying be each other’s enemies? Have we not been taught by our mothers, grandparents, and friends to know how and when to lie? Are we ‘experimenting’ with ‘truth’ in such cases? If we were members of Semitic religions, we could make sense of the victory of ‘the truth’, viz, of God. If ‘satya’ were to mean ‘the good’, we can understand the victory of ‘the good’ against evil. What would this mean if truth is a linguistic property of sentences? Of course, ‘Satyamev Jayate’ is a native Indian motto. Here and there, Indian writings hint at the existence of an ontological notion of truth but they became popular only during the British colonialism and under the influence of Protestant Christianity. (“Ekam Sat…” is about Sat but not about satya, whereas “bahudavadanti” is about truth-telling.) Thus, the point is that we cannot explain or understand what the victory of satya is without appealing to Semitic religions today. Do we really need to have a national motto incomprehensible to most of us Indians? 12: You define “culture” as combining two things, language, and actions. These exist not only as resources for enabling socialisation, but contain knowledge on how to use and experience these resources. You also say that in Western culture, religion plays an important role and in Indian culture it is rituals and practices. Can you expand on this idea with examples? I have put this across as a possible hypothesis of a phenomenon in chapter 3 of the book ‘What does it mean to be Indian?’ I have said more in ‘The Heathen…’, and in ‘Reconceptualizing India Studies’, and in many other articles. I suggest reading them to know more. 13: I wonder why you say that Islam and Christianity have adapted to the Indian configurations of learning despite differing belief systems. But you also state that madrassas and evangelical groups resist this adaptation to Indian cultural configurations. Can you explain this conflict, and why it is so important to understand in the Indian context? All things are influenced by the environment of which they are a part. Religion is no exception. The way Semitic religions evolved in a religious environment like Europe or in the Middle East is different from how the Semitic religions evolved in a non-religious environment like India. Europe or America today are ‘secular’ worlds; a ‘secular’ world in a religious culture is a secularised religious environment. Both religions and traditions face different challenges in different environments. Take, for example, the kind of problems faced by NRI Hindus: they are suddenly confronted with new questions and novel situations. So, they adapt to survive in that environment. Or take the Jews: European and Middle Eastern Jews who were victims of relentless persecution evolved differently compared to the Jews who lived peacefully in a non-religious environment like India. Thus, Islam and Christianity also changed in India. Today, there is also the growing impact of evangelical Christianity or Wahabism on them. It is a very complex issue with multiple threads, but I think that the increasing hostility and friction between communities in India has to do with the changing nature of these religions. But because we don’t have many intellectuals in India, we don’t have the resources to understand what is happening there. It is one of the biggest tragedies of India: not only do we not have many intellectuals, but we also do not appear to care about producing more of them. Your main concern is about the modern-day interaction between Indian culture and these two groups of militant evangelising Christians and the equally militant madrassas. Note that they are taking place against an India whose culture is losing its vibrancy. To understand this complex pattern of interaction and make a prognosis requires research of a kind that is totally non-existent in India. A moralising talk about the persecution of minority groups in India is the language of the current crop of Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi University and Asoka University people. It gives them ‘fame’ but produces no knowledge. 14: It seems likely that colonisation is not always a well-thought-out conspiracy by the coloniser. It is the product of the colonial powers using their own historical lenses to define or describe the colonised, but, at the same time, it also involves a long-term process whereby the colonised people develop a “colonial consciousness”. Why and how did India’s intellectuals start believing that their rulers understood them better than they themselves did? What could have been the triggers for this process? Colonialism is not a conspiracy: no massive social phenomenon is a conspiracy, well thought-out or otherwise. I speak about these two questions very briefly in my book, because much of the work on these issues belongs to ongoing research. I am one of the few who have identified and raised this as a question. There is a lot more work to be done before we can answer these questions. In my book, I say: “So, we can ask: what made Indians think that the British experience of India describes India the way it is? This issue becomes even more acute because of another claim that I have been developing: one of the characteristic aspects of Indian culture has been its continuous emphasis on reflecting on experience. Thus, Indian intellectuals must have been able to see that what the British were saying about them did not match their own experience. Yet, instead of disagreeing, they acquiesced. What made the Indian intellectuals blind to the nature of their own experience? If we assume that events that occurred in the world are responsible for this, what happened in the past that made the intellectuals of India lose their grip on an essential element of their culture? How could Indian culture have failed in accessing its own experience, when its internal focus was precisely on reflecting on experience?\u0026quot; (p. 84) The indicative hypothesis is that Indian culture was losing its vibrancy and the nature of her intellectuals must have changed their shape and form during this time. For now, what I say in the book is all I can say. When I die, I can leave behind what I have worked on for 40 years. After all, I am one man (and an old one at that) and the questions are many. There are no easy fruits to pluck, we must plant the trees and tend to them with the hope that our posterity can pluck the fruits. Our culture has always placed a huge premium on knowledge. Jnana and Saraswati are not easily acquired. You ask for examples of the resources of socialisation: our intuitive relationship to Saraswati, vidya and jnana are excellent examples. In any case, a very brief answer can be given. Indians succumbed to the descriptions of the colonisers because Indians were unable to counter them with their native descriptions. The crises in Indian society that preceded Islamic colonialism had weakened the Indian intellectual traditions. The Muslims damaged this weakened culture so that when the British came, our resources were almost exhausted due to a millennium of lack of use and quite some abuse. 15: Regarding Islamic colonisation, you say that it enabled the penetration of Islamic themes using Indian terms and concepts. This happened because Indian culture was already losing its vibrancy when Islam came to India… Can you speculate on why we were already losing vibrancy at that time, so that we became easy fodder for Islamic themes to enter our consciousness? How did Islam prevent us from accessing our own experiences? I am still trying to understand this phenomenon fully. This requires research which is still ongoing. It would not be correct to speculate about such serious matters now. As it is, disciplines which claim to study India are full of speculations, conjectures, and pernicious nonsense. I would be very irresponsible (and unethical, to be honest) to add to that. However, the following can be safely said. There must have been a huge crisis (maybe, there were many crises) in our culture because of which certain kinds of enquiries died. Certain ‘developments’ in Indian culture about 1,000 years ago were probably responses to crises that we could not adequately meet. That is, not everything that emerged in our culture, even centuries before the Islamic colonialism, indexes our strength; some of these developments could well be expressions of weaknesses. This is a call to seriously study the Indian past, not the way JNU and Delhi University scholars have done until now, but in a scientific manner. 16: You make a statement that there is intellectual poverty in already Islamised regions on the Indian sub-continent, in places like Pakistan, Bangladesh and Kashmir. Why do you say this? I say this because it is visible, isn’t it? These regions have not produced any great intellectuals in the last centuries and the environment in these regions is hostile to intellectual development. While people of Pakistan and Bangladesh do flourish and grow when they go to study in other countries, there are no noticeable native intellectuals in these regions. In fact, India is heading in the same direction: we don’t have intellectuals and we are not creating them. Irrespective of whether the decline will take the form of economic poverty or not, if things don’t change, the intellectual poverty in India will reach the same level as Pakistan or Bangladesh. For instance, if things in education (both secondary and higher) do not drastically change in the next 15 years, the educational landscape in India will soon resemble that of Black Africa in the 1930s. We simply do have less and less competent teachers in our educational landscape. Take the example of the reaction of most Indian intellectuals to the movie The Kashmir Files and the massive response of ordinary people. If the first aspect demonstrates anything, it lays bare the absolute barrenness of Indian intellectual landscape. I have not read a single reflection or review that even minimally tries to understand what people are responding to when they respond to the movie. Like everything else, this too is another occasion for moralising lectures about communalism, posturing against the imputed hatred the movie apparently propagates combined with expressions of pseudo-horror about an allegedly partial portrayal. Very few things can move the entire population like this movie did and I am still thinking about it. And perhaps will also write on the movie. Tragedies or violence are not new, especially when they are in the news every day. So, it cannot be that the overwhelming response of people had only to do with the horrors faced by the Pandits in Kashmir or the treachery of our ruling classes (politicians, intellectuals, and media). Shortly after the movie came out, I saw it in Belgium, I remember telling my daughter that this movie would enter the national consciousness of India. I have a feeling that one of the reasons why this movie has had the kind of impact it has is because it addresses our deeply held intuitions about our culture regarding knowledge, Saraswati, learning and the destructions wrought on it. One of the horrors we experience is to the rape of “Kashimra Puravasini” there and to her becoming a total alien in her hometown. (One of the first shlokas we learn as very young children goes thus: Namaste Sharade Devi, Kashimrapuravasini…) 17: Religion expands in two ways: through conversions, and then later by expanding the same ideas through a secularisation of theology. Christianity expands by de-Christianising its format… And this secularisation is brought about by violence. Religion, whether it remains religion of gets secularised, is about “othering” someone or something… Is this what you are trying to say? I don’t speak of ‘othering’. It is a jargon which doesn’t explain anything. To treat someone as ‘the other’ might be bad if they are the same as you and you don’t treat them that way. For example, if one is a Christian, and Christianity says, “we are all children of God”, to treat some people as the ‘other’ might be wrong. But if someone is different from you, your refusal to see and acknowledge that difference is wrong, isn’t it? In fact, I say that when the West looks at other cultures, it does not see them as ‘the other’. It sees and thus transforms them into a pale erring variant of itself. The other becomes another. I do not say that Judaism and Christianity also secularise themselves through violence. The emphasis on secularising violence seems truer of Islam. The Semitic religions see ‘Hinduism’ as another religion: false, to boot, but a religion, nevertheless. They see each other as the ‘other’, i.e., as deficient, or defective religions (or heresies). 18: You broadly seem to suggest that colonialism seems to have made us strangers to our own access to culture, and also that we simply have not made enough efforts to understand Western culture. Thus, we don’t know how we must respond to colonial ideas when they come back to bite us without our knowledge of it. We say and speak words that display our colonial consciousness. If Western efforts to understand us through their lenses did not bring us much good, why is the reverse process, of our understanding Western culture, going to do us much good? Should we not focus on understanding ourselves first? Today, the ways and means that we possess to understand ourselves, the intellectual frameworks, the concepts, the interconnections between them, the social scientific theories are all entirely built by Europeans. I have shown in my work that they are based much more on their experience of the world than on how the world is. There are any number of examples: the idea that ‘all cultures have religion’; the idea of a ‘unique self (soul) which all human beings have’; the notion that ‘the caste system characterises Indian society,’ etc. So, if we must understand ourselves, we must study the Europeans in very concrete ways. Of course, we will study and understand them as Indians. That is precisely the point. To recognise, first and foremost, that there are cultural differences between us. We must study these to understand the theories we have about human beings. To understand what we say about ourselves when we claim that we too have a religion or pontificate that one must be true to oneself, and that the caste system must be eradicated, we must study the West. We must understand the intellectual frameworks and their implications to understand our laws and to learn how to make laws which don’t make a travesty of everything good and just. To understand ourselves, we must understand western culture. Whether we like it or not, colonialism happened, and colonial consciousness exists. The question is how we can get out of it and regain access to our experience. My research programme, “Comparative Science of Cultures”, formulates one way of doing it. We cannot return to a pristine past of pre-colonialism. The question facing us today is ‘what does it mean to be Indian in the 21st century?’ To know more about the methodology of this approach, which the question raises, the second and third chapter in ‘Reconceptualizing India Studies’ might help. They explicate my answers and their justifications. 19: In a country where “freedom of religion” is written into the constitution, how do we defend Indian/Hindu rights if you do not even define it as a religion? How can law makers even begin to understand the difference between religion and tradition, or the need to protect “majority” rights that are not religious in nature? This is one of the big problems in India. We have no investments in research and development in social sciences. (The UGC does massively fund ideological propaganda by calling it ‘funding social research’.) There are also no institutions (political, legal, educational, or even charitable) which are interested in stimulating novel social scientific research. If Hinduism is not a religion and current legal frameworks are primarily structured by Semitic religions, how can non-religious traditions hope to have the protections of law? This is not just a question for ‘Hindus’, but one that is also of crucial importance to other traditions like the native American or African. What would the frameworks or even minimal formulation of law look like which is not Semitic in nature but one which makes space for traditions too? To get an idea of enormity of the question: despite decades of experience and knowledge, even a group of gifted intellectuals will have to do four to five years of full-time research to begin answering this question. There have been barely any attempts by Hindus to try and understand themselves, their social and institutional world, and their implications. Even to this day, people think that it is a definitional problem or a semantic discussion. (‘According to us religion is…’ or ‘Abrahamic definition of religion is…’). Our Supreme Court routinely cites the US juridical definitions to decide about cases involving religious disputes in India. So, to answer the question about how lawyers can understand and argue about the difference between religion and tradition, first, social scientists must develop at least the beginnings of an alternative legal framework, legal definitions, etc. Second, it is a collaborative research project with people who specialise in the comparative science of cultures, religion and constitutional law and Indian law. Third, out of such a long-term collaborative project, some tangible results like providing a skeletal legal framework for traditions which can be integrated into existing legal structures could emerge. Such a project does not exist. Further, to understand our ‘laws’, we must look at who the ‘lawmakers’ are. Could it be seriously suggested that our current crop of MPs and MLAs even understand what they are legislating? Laws are written (the way the Indian Constitution got written) by third-rate bureaucrats in capital cities: neither they nor the ‘legislators’ know what they are doing. 20: The need to defend Hindu rights (we don’t even get to run our own temples) have led to a political platform broadly called Hindutva, but social justice warriors want to pit Hinduism against Hindutva and there was even a global conference called to “dismantle Hindutva”. What should our reasoned stand on these issues be, if Hinduism is not even a religion? Those defending Hindutva and those attacking it are both using the same intellectual framework. I have spoken of it in different places, including in “What does it mean to be ‘Indian’?” (Page 25). If Hinduism does not exist and India has no religion, what does it mean to speak of (Hindu) religious fundamentalism? How then do we understand the phenomenon of Hindutva? (See also my preface in Cultures Differ Differently.) None of the so-called India-scholars is raising these questions. The conference you speak of was a marginal event, organised by academically fringe groups. But it gained wide-spread recognition because of the attention given to it by the people who got attacked by it. It surprises me that the so-called right-wing, in so far as it can be considered a coherent entity, has not realised that it now embodies and implements the PR strategy of these fringe ‘scholars’: bait ‘Hindutva’ if you want to gain academic approval and social recognition. There are two problems in the way the question is asked: (1) One is that there is a “need to defend Hindu rights” which led to the political platform of Hindutva. Yet the ruling party, which is considered Hindutva, has gone much further than the Congress in the appeasement of minorities and instituting welfare schemes. (2) The suggestion is that “social justice warriors want to pit Hinduism against Hindutva”. But the Hindutva, whether in the form of civil organisations or as a political party, has completely bought into social justice ideology. (When people claim that the victory of the BJP in the recent elections is the result of a “pro-poor” policy of the government, or that BJP wants to win the elections to promote ‘socially just’ policies, one is enthusiastically espousing social justice slogans. Such people are also the real social justice warriors in India.) The growth of social justice ideology and its conflation with political correctness is relatively new in the West. But the poisonous combination of identity politics, social justice and political correctness has existed in India for decades. The reservation system which has ballooned out-of-control, the atrocities act, etc., are expressions of social justice ideology promoted and encouraged also by the current ruling party. Hindutva is doing more to promote ‘social justice’ warriors than Congress and its allies ever did. And yet, academic fringe groups sell the idea (which the Right strengthens) that there is ‘caste atrocity’ and ‘minority insecurity’ in India under the BJP, while the current ruling party is the best defender and protector of the so-called ‘Dalits’ and ‘minority religious groups’. It might be interesting to note that the notion of ‘social justice’ is of Christian (Roman Catholic) origin, best formulated by their Pope in the twentieth century. Without a Christian framework within which to understand and endorse it, the entire ‘social justice’ idea dissolves into incoherence. Leo Shields, commissioned as a Lieutenant in the US army and dies fighting in France in 1945, received a doctorate from the University of Notre Dame in 1941 for his dissertation on “The History and Meaning of the Term Social Justice”. There, he summarises it as follows: “The … message of social justice is written in sharp relief against…(the) background of individualist thought in all its forms — romantic, rationalistic, humanitarian, totalitarian. It is the key to the reintegration of social life that must be inspired by Christian faith and charity and supported by grace. But it is a key which even this pagan society can turn if it is shown how. The realization of the idea of social justice is the unity of social peace.” (I have written on this issue: see the article “Caste-based reservation and ‘social justice’ in India”. It is published in the book Western Foundations of the Caste System, 2017, and is also available on my academia.edu page.) The current ruling party bends over backwards to appease ‘oppressed’ groups because it has bought into the image sold by others that it is a ‘religious fundamentalist party’ or that it is a ‘majoritarian party’ and that it would be against ‘social justice’ to do otherwise, etc. I do not think that the BJP (and the Sangh Parivar) are religious fundamentalists. This way of characterising and demonising them is the favorite pastime of the intellectually weak. But the BJP buys into its hook, line and sinker and is constantly busy ‘defending’ itself from these pseudo-attacks. 21: Islam has 200 million adherents in India, and Christianity is expanding fast through conversions in many states. There are non-Hindu majorities in seven states/Union Territories, and even states like Kerala may soon have fewer than 50 per cent who call themselves Hindu (it is 54 per cent now, but in 20 years, it could fall below 50 per cent). How do we apply your theories and postulates to defend the ideas that are truly Indian, especially when radical Islam and Evangelical Christianity are seeking to differentiate and dissociate from Indian cultural ethos, aided by global social justice warriors? I have spoken about how religion spreads in two ways: secularisation and proselytisation. Secularisation is more dangerous of the two. Strangely, Indians are more worried about proselytisation than they are about secularisation, which spreads Christian ideas in a de-Christianised form. Indian culture was not threatened by these religions, and it was able to deal with their proselytising drive. It did so without persecuting them or banning them. A vibrant Indian culture can handle religion in such a way that religion itself changes to adapt itself into the non-religious environment it finds itself in. But the impact of colonialism, the enduring colonial consciousness and secularisation of religious ideas have consistently reduced the vibrancy of our culture. Post-Independence has seen an acceleration of this loss-of-vibrancy. The process of secularisation transforms ‘the other’, in our case the Indian traditions, into pale and erring variants of religion. We Indians swallow this silly idea hook, line, and sinker. One of the reasons why Indian culture is losing its vibrancy is because we are busy transforming it into something it is not. We are unable to transmit the culture we received from our ancestors to posterity because we have taken over the language and framework of the West (from Indology and other social sciences). It is not a question of practical problems like how to argue in a court of law, but a question of how you look at yourself, your life, and your experiences. What is breathtaking is the combination of ignorance and complacency of Indians. We don’t understand English, but we are certain that we are experts there. We very easily pick up words and sentences and use them without any reflection or self-reflection and even write on our ‘experiments with truth’. We don’t ask if those words make sense of our experience. This did not create huge problems to the generation that grew up in the 1950s because they were schooled in regional languages and used English in addition to it. But that is no longer the case; it has progressively become worse with every generation. Thus, we have today’s generation which only learns English (that too badly) and as a result cannot speak, think, or write coherently in any language. Not in English and not in any regional language. Regional languages have provided protection against colonial consciousness. I often tell my Indian students to think in their native languages, as though they are speaking to their grandmothers. The result is striking: the amount of nonsense that comes out of their mouths gets reduced drastically. It is much harder to speak in slogans, jargon and produce verbiage if you must explain it in Kannada or Marathi to your grandmother. Then you are forced to interrogate what you are saying. You are forced to think. (You cannot explain to your grandmother what ‘coloniality’ or ‘decoloniality’ is even if someone has coined a regional language word to translate these words.) But unfortunately, regional languages are on the decline. The millennials were already severely handicapped and now their children will be even more stunted: incoherent, confused, and unhappy personalities who speak broken English with pseudo-American accents. We can improve this sorry situation by promoting regional languages in India. One way to do it would be to combine the strengths of the twentieth century with the strengths of our culture (its orality) by creating and promoting audio books of some of the great literature written in Indian regional languages. Because the millennial and post-millennial generations cannot read or write in regional languages, they have a very limited access to language and culture. The scope of their language is limited to conversations with friends and TV series. Without access to the richness of ideas through language, they have no way of evolving. So, they lose access to one of the most important resources of a culture: its literature, art, and ideas. And without these resources, they cannot aspire to become anything more than two-dimensional uncultured boors. Therefore, by making the literature in regional languages available as audio books, we can partially restore their access to regional languages and thus to Indian culture and ideas. What I hope will happen in India is that a generation will come which can look at the ravages wrought by colonialism and the post-independence institutions and start dismantling the useless and dangerous structures and start building anew. They will have to be intellectuals and builders, formed and shaped by the consequences of the current generation’s failures. Perhaps the grandchildren of the millennials. They will need intellectual tools and frameworks. It is for that posterity that I write.\n","tags":[],"title":"Balagangadhara's interview with Swarajya","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/balu-interview-with-swarajya/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","colonial consciousness","colonialism","published","secularization","swarjyamag","Islam"],"content":"[ Published on swarjyamag Aug 26, 2022] Let me recollect the question we agreed upon: how does the combined phrase (colonial mindset and servitude) make sense within the framework of my research programme? My hypothesis on religion includes characterizing the dynamics of its expansion. As I see it, such a dynamic includes (a) conversion and (b) secularization. The first side of the dynamic, ‘conversion’, is well-known to most of us: here, some or another religion inducts ‘non-believers’ into its fold or into its community of believers and practitioners. (I also called it ‘proselytization’, a term that notices how Judaism and Christianity use ‘proselyte’.) The second side of the dynamic, ‘secularization’, is known to us only very partially. Made popular since the Enlightenment period in Europe, this partial description identifies an antithetical movement where an individual religion begins to lose its earlier influence on its spheres of influence: the civil organizations and the civil authorities. This classical story is about the withdrawal of religion from various domains in society: politics, law, judiciary, and so on. In this ‘age of reason’, it is suggested that human reason begins to govern these institutions and provide their foundations instead of religious opinions and dogmas. One of its consequences is the loss of the power and control of the Church on the State. Called ‘secularism’, this process indicates the waning power of religion on people and their imaginations especially by freeing the civil, the social, and the psychological spheres of human beings and society. The freedom from those shackles that enslaved them over the millennia made human beings and their societies grow and expand. ‘Indian Secularism’ (both as a vacuous doctrine and in the threadbare ‘foundation’ it received in the Indian constitution) expresses this faith and this conviction in an extremely pathetic form ever since (or even decades before) the Indian independence 75 years ago. My story, while giving credence to the hostility it expresses, locates the ‘secularization process’ as another side in the expansion of religion. Secularization is antithetical to the expansion of some or another religion, but it expands religion itself as a phenomenon in a culture or society. As we know, each religion (I have the Semitic religions in mind here) is always a specific religion: it emerged at some time, in a specific region, among a specific people, in a specific language, embodying specific doctrines, and specific practices. Thus, every religion (even where it aspires to be the religion for the entire humankind) is always a specific religion. These very specificities that lend identity to some or another religion act as constraints on religion, which is, as I characterize it, the explanatory intelligible account of the Cosmos and itself. This account is the truth about all that was, is and shall be. This truth is not only in the world but religion, as such an account, exhibits that truth. Thus, religion, as religion, expands itself while this or that specific religion expands through conversion. Both, taken together, are moments in the expansion of religion. Even though secularization of religion is a general process, how this process occurs is determined by the conditions of emergence of a specific religion and how that religion converts. That is, how religion secularizes itself is subject to the nature and constraints that the specific religions face. Thus, the secularization of Judaism, Christianity and Islam occur differently even where each of them undergoes secularization as a moment in its expansion. In each of these religions, secularization is inimical and hostile to a particular religion because of the specificities that give us an individual religion. In ‘What does it mean to be an Indian?’ I said that Indians were children of two colonialisms: one colonizer was Islam and the other was the British. This means that religions too colonize. I did not expand on the idea in that book (you must wait for the upcoming works to grasp the idea more fully), but I will briefly outline only one element of this colonizing event. It is true that Islam tried to convert Indians and it is also true that it did so violently. While Islam launched many waves of destructive attacks on Indian traditions, their temples, and practices, etc., we were not colonized by this aspect or phase of Islamic expansion. (It is in the nature of religions, Christianity and Islam, to convert through extremely violent means when conversion is directed towards larger populations and established cultures. Judaism, after around 5th century C.E., almost stopped conversion. There are various reasons for this cessation, none of which is relevant for my story here.) We were colonized by secularized Islam. That is, conversion into Islam did not colonize us; the secularized Islam did. I have already noted that secularization is inimical and hostile to religion. What does it mean in our case? It means that the secularized Islam that colonized us was hostile to Islam as a religion. Among other things, it means that it is hostile to Islamic doctrines as well. How? In very simple religious terms: secularized Islam is blasphemy (within the framework of Islam as a religion). What does this mean? According to Islam, Allah is the Lord and the Ruler of the Universe. As the word ‘Islam’ indicates, it demands an attitude of absolute submission and total surrender to Allah and His will. It requires a complete obedience to Him; human beings must follow His rules and Laws unconditionally. In its phase of conversion into a religion, Islam tried to inculcate this reverential attitude and habit towards Allah among the converted. In its secularizing moment, Secularized Islam reversed this thought and attitude entirely and gave it a blasphemous form: among Indians, it inculcated and induced such a habit and attitude, not towards Allah, but towards human rulers. Secularized Islam put human Muslim rulers of India above the Prophet Mohammed and placed the same rulers as Allah’s equals. This is how secularized Islam expressed its antithetical attitude to Islam as a religion and expressed its hostility towards Islam. I have claimed that colonialism transforms the experience of people and prevents the colonial subjects from accessing it in any form other than how the colonizer defines it. This inability to access our experience is what I call ‘colonial consciousness’. This is what secularized Islam also did: it introduced slavishness and servitude into Indian psychology. Centuries of this colonization made a slavish submission to civil authorities the hallmark and an important trait of Indian cultural psychology. In very simple terms: Indians became slavish, submissive, and servile to civil (i.e., human) authorities. The British noticed this psychological trait of Indians and said that Indians were ‘effeminate’ and had ‘no backbone’. Though this is what all the Bengalis were in their eyes, after all, Bengal was one of first important ports of call to the British; very soon, all Indians joined the group of a servile people. That is why they went in search of ‘military’ castes in their attempts to recruit Indians to the British army. They found such ‘castes’ among the Sikhs and the Marathas (both of whom fought the Muslim rulers over long periods) and the Gurkhas (who were least subject to secularized Islamic rule). They found it among some ‘sub-castes’ as well: the Coorgis in Karnataka belonged to the ‘martial type’. The rest of India was too effeminate to be of much use except to slavishly obey the British authorities and lick their boots. How Indian child-rearing practices and the socialization processes in India succumbed to cultivating servility in Indian children because of Islamic colonization has not been understood yet. But that is not relevant to this story now. When British ‘gave’ India her independence, the Indian servility did not disappear. It continues to be produced and reproduced even today. If we look at how Indians relate to civil authorities, we see this servitude everywhere. The bureaucracy, the police, the ministers receive obsequiousness without demanding it. They punish those who dare ‘defy’ them. This is not merely how ordinary Indians relate to political and administrative authorities: this is institutionalized within these organizations too. How a peon responds to the boss; how a junior secretary bows down to the Deputy secretary; how the Chief secretary deals with Principal secretaries; how the chief minister treats the principal and the chief secretaries, how the circle inspector treats the local constable and is treated in turn by the assistant commissioner of police… This servitude, often called sycophancy, goes all the way to the very top. This is how Indians are seen abroad: whether by the Chinese or in the West. Obsequious, eager to please and servile. This cultural psychology expresses our colonial consciousness as induced by Islamic colonization. Very recently, a few weeks ago, I read somewhere that Rahul Gandhi fulminated against the Indian foreign service officials thus: Indian diplomats are seen to have become arrogant by others elsewhere in the world (due to Modi’s government). This perception makes sense: Indian diplomats are not any more as servile as they were in the last sixty years. They continue to have this psychology, but they do not express it as ‘the normal’ anymore. There is much, much more to say than what I have. The story is bigger, broader, and richer than what I have penned so far. But I will round-off here. The phrase that combines ‘colonial mindset’ and ‘servitude’ makes sense within my research programme this way. It tells me how one colonialism has generated one aspect of our psychology. This attitude and orientation are in us and with us even now and will have their own poisonous and deleterious impacts on the development of the amritkaal that the PM spoke about. As I told you in an earlier mail, I have no clue what the PM intended or meant. This post is merely an attempt to see whether the combination makes sense within my research programme. It does. However, the implications are gigantic: both for pursuing the pledge (the pran) and to fulfill it in the amritkaal that the PM seeks. They have their own pernicious effects on the current programmes of the government and all its future policies. I must apologize for the brevity. You must wait for the upcoming works to understand this story properly. But I do hope this post will have done enough to keep the promise that I made in my earlier post. Clarifications:\nYou ask: “Are you saying that secularisation in Islam has something to do with India; at least that India contributed to it, in some non-trivial way?”. Yes, indeed, I do. The issues about Indian spirituality (or ‘religions’) pertain to the religion that Islam is. I am talking about Secularized Islam entering the ideational domain. If the British marginalized Indians in the process of secularizing Christianity, Islam could not have secularized itself in the ideational domain without very active Indian participation. The issue of ‘corruption’ does not emerge here, as I see the issue. How Islam became Indian or even why Indians gave a place to Islam in their culture has to do with, yes, the mature culture that India was. Further, it has also to do with how India ‘saw’ Islam. That is, it is partly about answering the following question: in what precise sense is the heathen blind to religion? Islam was not a hard nut to crack, any more than Judaism and Christianity were. It has to do with cracking their secrets as religions, something which they wore on their sleeves, so to speak. The how and the why of all of these, and thus the puzzles you raise, must await future publications, I am afraid. The ‘king’ or the ‘emperor’ that secularized Islam instituted in India is unconnected to what ‘Kings’ were in Indian thinking. In its process of secularization in the ideational domain, Islam did not introduce (as British Christianity did) either a new or a different notion of politics or kingship. Keep in mind that Islamic intellectuals did not secularize Islam in India. There was no theorizing (as far as I know) of any ‘Islamic politics’ outside a repetitive reproduction of Shariya.

But if you use these thinkers (of the last 1000 years or so) to think about experience, you will be trapped in a set of problems: (a) you will have to talk about sensory input (no matter what technical term you use here), which cognition works on; (b) the world as something that provides these inputs; (c) distinguishing subjectivity and objectivity of the perception of the world accordingly and so on. Ultimately, truth becomes the final arbiter of everything. In contrast stands Indian thinking that talks about ‘forms’ (Rupa, Rasa, Sparsha, Sabda, Gandha etc) that interact with our abilities (that includes cognition as a part) and about how this world of forms interacts with us. This leads to our notion(s) of experience. In this case, we do not talk about indoctrination but about learning and changing the processes of learning. I have decided to take the second route because it helps me find solutions to problems. The first route blocks even the noticing that there are problems. Of course, I have not yet written out even the outlines of the second route, whereas the first has many champions over the last 500 years. To outline the second route absorbing what cognitive sciences and multiple psychologies (not to speak of biology) tell us about ourselves is a huge undertaking, which I cannot possibly complete before I die.

Conflict in duties does not give you a moral dilemma. For a moral dilemma to occur two necessary conditions must exist: the prescribed set of duties must be logically consistent by virtue of which one is obliged to perform them all. A dilemma pertains to a situation where one has an obligation to do A and an obligation to do B; but can in fact do only one. It is the perfect consistency of the system of duty that gives rise to the dilemma: a choice between A and B, between a banana and an orange is not a dilemma. It becomes a dilemma when you want both and can have only one. So, a moral dilemma cannot possibly describe a conflict of duties if one uses the word ‘duty’ here. A conflict of dharmas is not a dilemma at all. What I mean by decolonizing social Sciences is very simple thing. There are many domains today: sociology, political science, psychology, and anthropology that call themselves social sciences as distinct from humanities. So, I am not talking about decolonizing science in the specific sense given by Mohini Mullick. I do not consider the theories in these domains which call themselves social sciences to be science at all. Today, I see all of them without exception as ideologies. I call my project ‘Comparative Science of Culture’ because existing theories are not social sciences. For instance: political corruption refers to the act of an individual public servant who is part of a state or a government and who acts against the public interest of the people or the interest of the state. Because state has an interest which coincides with the interest of the society, then any action that supports an individual’s interest is morally wrong. This is the meaning of political corruption. I am very conservative. I want a scientific hypothesis in the sense that it solves a problem, has an explanatory potential and there is some way to test it. In this sense, political theory is completely bankrupt. I proffer two hypotheses which at least minimally do what you expect a hypothesis to do. The first is purely historical in nature. You raised a question about the moral evaluations which comes from a completely Western ethics and is not Indian at all. We in India had our own forms of social organization. We had certain indigenous ways of governing, of organizing production. But with colonization came industrialization, bringing with it management institutions from the West; structures were imposed on native Indian industries, on native structures, which today are taught in MBA courses all over India. The result is institutional distortion, so that you come across extraordinary things that baffle management theorists. More concretely: how were questions asked about tradition? Can we use the resources of our ancient Indian literature to tackle and explain this problem? I find the Indian tradition powerful because it can help generate scientific hypotheses beyond the reach of Western social scientists. That’s why I am against the latter, not because they are Western. I am not against everything Western: Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, Biology come from the Western tradition.

Could it be the case that when it comes to the Indian systems, they all (whether it is Advaita vedanta, Yoga vasistha, visista advaita) are teaching one to act, to live in a particular way? In other words, they are not saying what there is in the world but are manuals in a manner of speaking. Of course, in order to understand a manual you need reference points in the world. So when they say for example that when the Buddha argued for anatman or Sankara spoke about atman, one way of interpreting, which is what most Indian philosophers have done, is that they attribute doctrines to them and say this is a description of the world. But actually they were not describing the world. Buddha does not say atman exists or does not exist or whatever. Sankara is not saying atman exists because that would be a description of our world. So what a guru does in our tradition, which is what the upadesa is, is to teach one to not look at these as descriptions of the world; he teaches one how to transform them into a way of living. So Yoga vasistha does not tell you what the world is like. That can be said in one sentence. Why then does this man have to write so much? It is to help you go on in a certain way and then say that this is not a description of the world.

First you are not talking only about the Greeks and the Romans because all the problems arising with respect to the phenomena of non-Western societies and culture are/were equally the problems in the frameworks of different varieties of culture. You not only talk about the Greeks and the Romans, you gave examples about the French and the English as well. The second point is: you talk about the fact that people face the same problem in Europe of today when they talk about the Greeks and the Romans. You are absolutely right. But that confirms my point, namely, that the Greeks and the Romans had no religion. They were Pagan cultures and this is exactly the problem with India. The Christian culture doesn’t understand Greek — the whole of Heidegger’s philosophy is an example of that. He says we cannot think Greek. And his whole attempt to speak about what thinking is, what truth is, etc. — is an attempt to rescue the Greek language from what he called the Christianization of Latin. I am aware that contemporary European languages and modern Europe do have problems with the Greeks and Romans. But just because of the fact that Ancient Greece and Rome are located in the Western hemisphere does not make them part of Western culture. In an earlier publication, I showed that neither Greece nor Rome were cradles of Western civilization. Western Civilization is Christian Civilization, although you might not agree with that. Greece and Rome do not belong to it. That is why we Indians can understand them. Let me give you a small example — One of the most fundamental notions of Aristotle is eudaimonia, which gets translated with great difficulty as ‘well-being’, ‘feeling good’, ‘happiness’ and so on. It is a very difficult word to translate. This is not merely a translation problem because I have had discussions with Greek scholars. Aristotle asks: what is eudaimonia? It is very difficult to achieve of course but he says once you have it you cannot lose it. I told a Greek Specialist once ‘you know nothing about Greek language’, He responded: ‘how dare you say that’! So, I said: ‘here is a simple thing, forget the translation of eudaimonia, give me one example of a human property which once you possess, you do not lose.’ I said: ‘I do not have to understand Greek to understand what eudaimonia means.’ And of course to this day, no Greek scholar could help me in giving one example of one human property which if once you possess you do not lose\u0026ndash;this is a fundamental property of eudaimonia. For the Indians here is my answer. Eudaimonia is aananda. Once you have aananda you do not lose it. It is equivalent in some conditions to brahma-gyaana. And that is happiness indeed, beyond sukha and duhkha. So when Aristotle is talking about eudaimonia I understand him and I read him carefully. Of course, there is no translation equivalent of eudaimonia in any of the European languages but that is because they have no access to that world, that conceptual framework like we Indians have. So indeed, I understand you have a problem with Greece and Rome: we understand them much better. Two other points \u0026ndash; one on Galileo. I am not conflating the community of Christians with a community of non-Christians because one of the claims I have substantiated to which in the last fifteen years I have found no counter argument, is the following: My claim is that free thinkers and atheists, even the Communists of Europe, are actually disguised theists. That is to say that Christianity has secularized itself in political theory, in social theory, in rational choice theory; a number of theories. I can show you how assumptions from the Bible have taken secular forms. So by saying for instance, ‘look I don’t have a religious background’, it makes no difference. I know people, who do not have a religious background for generations, are atheists but they continue to have the same excuse for speaking as Christians do. For example, your ethics will be absolutely no different from Christian ethics because there is no such thing as non-Christian secular ethics present today. ‘You ought not to kill’. Don’t tell me that is an example of secular ethics. Even the notion of ‘ought not’, the normative notion itself, does not come from English: it comes from Christianity, from the Bible. Aristotle, for example, does not have an ‘ought’. Indian languages do not have a ‘moral ought’ nor do the Chinese in their language in which Confucius wrote. These are not linguistic issues, Claus, these are problems of conceptual apparatuses that are culturally developed. So, it is in that sense that I speak about Galileo and say he made sense to the Europeans. They used his findings to investigate nature because they believed fundamentally that nature has a structure and pattern and a law which has to be discovered by human investigation. They would say that without such a structure the universe should be chaos. The whole of 2,000 years of European culture believes that, and that was Galileo’s idea as well. It is a background belief, of course, but it is a background belief of that culture and we are talking about difference between cultures. Translation is always a translation between people who use sentences, who use natural languages. So, I am shifting the level of the problem. Last point, there is something to be said for your claim regarding the notion of belief\u0026ndash;that you can have a concept, but do not have a word\u0026ndash;that is absolutely true. That is our daily experience. I feel like saying something but I don’t know how to say it. So, you can have some sense of a concept but defined psychologically not linguistically or so cognitively. I do not know how to put it in a natural sentence. Right. But you are making out of it logical and philosophical points. Let me put it very sharply. The notion of having a belief and the belief is always about something; this is a specific conception of man, of human beings\u0026ndash;there is philosophical anthropology which attributes some notion of intention to human beings. One of the extraordinary things about the Indian tradition is the absence of this notion of intentionality: agyana. They call it maaya and many different things. So the nature of human being in the Indian tradition is that we are non-intentional creatures, which is completely incomprehensible within the framework of Christian culture. So, entertaining having a belief is not a linguistic, psychological, epistemological fact which is applicable to all human beings but is a specific assumption about the nature of human beings that comes from the Bible. So when saying that Indians have beliefs, you are not making use of any understanding of language – you are making use of a religious concept/understanding of man and saying that is what Indians have. Of course, you can say that; people have been saying that for 500 years. That is not the issue. The issue is: is this how Indians understand themselves? In fact, if you look at the languages you find there is greater affinity when you talk of using work-words. They do not say ‘I got angry’ but ‘anger came upon me’ \u0026ndash; this is a very typical old classical Greek way of talking. ‘Why did you say that?’ ‘I do not know, my tongue moved that way’. I am literally translating local Indian languages into English\u0026ndash;this is the way we talk. In fact, even the subject notion, is not simply a linguistic subject or verb subject in action, the fundamental ontological notion of subject itself is missing in India as also the notion of agency. Take the problem about truth: the notion of truth for applying to sentences, to propositions by some other philosophers is a very philosophical disease. If you look at the middle-ages, take Aquinas for example, he had two notions of truth: adeequatio re and adequatio intellectus. One is which is adequate to the object; the other which is adequate to thoughts. Hegel used the same notion. Tarski also says there are multiple notions of truth. That notion of truth — adaquatio intellectus as it prevailed for 1,900 years in Western culture referred to the fact that objects are adequate to how God conceives them. That is adequatio intellectus\u0026ndash;adequate not to human intellects, to God’s intellect. Adequatio re had to do with how one related the word to both these notions and emerged, not from any understanding of language, truth, philosophy, or logic, it arose from commenting on theologies and commenting the Bible. (pp 162-166 \u0026ldquo;Classical Indian Thought and the English Language\u0026rdquo; edited by Mullick, et al.)\n","tags":[],"title":"Truth, belief, intentionality, eudaimonia, ought","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/truth-belief-intentionality-eudaimonia-ought/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","basics","published","transcript"],"content":"The question requires deeper handling so you will forgive me for the brevity of my response but you will get some idea of where I stand. Regarding the first question as to whether we reject social science itself, I am aware that many people have made this suggestion. I am not so much hung up on the word \u0026lsquo;social science\u0026rsquo; but I do believe that we need to systematically reflect on our experiences in the world. A systematic reflection on experiences in the form of a theory is what we can conveniently call social science. We need theories about the world to understand the World. Systematic thinking means use of certain criteria to decide which theories are good or not, etc. and which to choose. The best thing would be to appeal to the history of the natural sciences over say four hundred years to see how they have done it, what kind of criteria they used. Thus, I belong to the group which advocates systematic reflection on experience, and in that sense, I belong to the group which says we need social science. Your second question was about Indians having different ways of understanding experience: you spoke of narratives and the autobiography of Tulsi Ram. This raises the question of what form these reflections are going to take. To give a crude example: are they going to be mathematized? Will they take the form of scientific laws or of narratives? That is a very interesting question. But all narratives are not social science: in that case every novelist would have a scientific theory.

Let me first read how you have formulated the problem from the text: Sanskrit scholars need modem social scientists. What disturbs me in anthropological fieldwork is that Sanskrit literature is made to play the role of native informer to social scientists, with the anthropologists asking themselves as they might with Maori culture: is there something valuable which has been lost? Claus Oetke also makes the same point. Even if you say that the dialogue between the primitive and the anthropologist is sophisticated, native informers are not merely informants. This idea, this interaction pattern which has existed for the last forty years has a double bias\u0026ndash;that of the anthropologist and that of the native informant. They have very powerful dialogues but anthropologists fundamentally take a priori positions, assuming that Sanskritists are the only ones who hold the key: they do not really believe that non-Sanskritists could possibly have anything to contribute. But it would be absurd to dismiss Indian culture a priori without an investigation into India\u0026rsquo;s intellectual contributions without entertaining the possibility that Indian culture and tradition might today in a very significant sense be a challenge to the Western traditions which form our intellectual background. Your question shuts it out because it comes from Sanskrit. In your story of the fieldwork model, all Indian parameters answer the sophisticated social scientists model. I am surprised because you have another strand which goes in the opposite direction. But the fundamental framework you are using suggests maximally that we might learn something like Sanskrit aesthetics, rasa theory, etc. or even something like curry. This kind of trivialization has resulted from colonialism: it has been and is, very suppressive. pp 42-43 of \u0026ldquo;Classical Indian Thought and the English Language\u0026rdquo; edited by Mullick, et al.\n","tags":[],"title":"A priori assumptions","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/a-priori-assumptions/"},{"categories":["action","Balagangadhara","knowledge"],"content":"In the examples you refer to, you touch on an approach to situations and problems that are Indian (in the sense of culture) contrasted to which stands another culture’s way of dealing with situations. The simplest way to explicate this difference in a general way, using your examples as a reference point, would be this: when we speak of problems and solutions, there are two ways of looking at them. In the first, an existing problem gets resolved: both the problem and its solution continue to exist (both in memory and in records) in their forms of appearance. They have their independent existence even though they are conceptually (and chronologically) linked to each other. That is, a problem does not ‘disappear’ after its resolution; the solution retains its status (as a solution to a particular problem) as does the problem. This is how the West looks at problems and their resolution (mostly). This is also how we think scientifically. To put it in the form of a slogan, which has its own limitations: a situation is transformed into a theoretical problem. In human situations (i.e., situations involving human conflicts and difficulties), the above approach is damaging. In the Indian way, which is geared and focused on human situations, the event (or the situation) is turned into a practical problem. In such cases, the solutions dissolve the problem. Neither the problem nor the solution has any existence thereafter because the dissolution of the problem creates a new situation. The memory and the records of this act, which transformed one situation into another, will exist but in their status as changed states: a memory or a record of how a state-change occurred because of a set of actions. When the first way is used to deal with human problems, psychologically speaking, a trauma is ‘left behind’. In the second case, what you undergo in the world gets structured as an experience and this is what a human being accumulates over the course of its life. In a very general sense, again in the form of a slogan, a situation is made into a practical problem. It appears to me that in situations of uncertainty and imperfect information, the second approach is better of the two. Even if a solution might not have been the best (speaking from hindsight), it enables a human being to continue to live as well as situations possibly allow. In the first approach, you continue to live as a crippled human being haunted by one or multiple traumas. (Because in ‘What does it mean to be an Indian?’ these ideas are treated in greater detail, I will not elaborate further on these here.) The general Indian approach to, say, rape, would then be contrasted with how Indian (and western) feminists speak of rape using a legal and a western language. Abortion would also be an illustration: the examples you give would then be contrasted with how the issue is ‘debated’ in the US. Now, to the issue you raise. Is the Indian route moral and ethical? If you follow how the West has thought on morality and ethics (especially in the last 200 years or more), the answer is in the negative. This is how our intellectuals and semi-intellectuals talk: with the greatest possible ignorance about what the West says and about what ethics is, they reproduce their words. Moral/immoral, just/unjust, ethical/unethical, and so on. Even though most would not be able to explain what a moral obligation is or what a moral forbiddance is, they hold forth a moralizing discourse defending atrocious policies, laws, and attitudes. Those who follow the Indian way are intellectually incapable of saying or thinking coherently about their ethics: they spout what they ‘think’ Shastras say and what, according to whatever takes their fancy at the moment, dharma and adharma are. In short: all the moral talk and ethical theories in the West has only produced the most immoral civilization that humankind has the misfortune to live under. A truly humane and reasonable approach to the human predicament has generated the biggest bunch of morons that the world has ever produced in recent times, who parade their utter ignorance as knowledge. When you formulate the above issue as a question, “pregnancy and abortion are very practical affairs - emotional yes, but not moral or ethical. Is this a right way to think about it?” the answer cannot be unambiguous. Yes, it is a moral and ethical issue because it is a practical issue. Ethics and morality are practical issues par excellence: but one who talks about it (the West) has made this issue theoretical whereas the other (India) who acts in a practical way does not know how to talk about it. One is bloated with an insufferable pretention and the other is bloated with absolute ignorance. But both ply their trade on the market fighting for customers. In simple terms: we must try to think and articulate how human issues are practical and ethical and thus live without traumas dominating our lives.

The film Innocence of Muslims has turned cities around the world upside down in the past week, and threatens to continue to do so. “We never insult other prophets”, says the tenor of several Muslims, “so why can’t we demand that Mohammed receive respect? We respect others; why do they insult us?\u0026quot; Others argued that the anger stems from a demand for “freedom”: the right of a community to be free from serious insults against its identity and values. As with the Mohammed cartoons from a few years ago, the same cliché appears in the debates: there must be more respect for the other. Everyone also believes that he has that respect for the other. But despite all that self-proclaimed respect, the world has not become more peaceful. What is going on then? For Muslims, it is the religious issue of ridiculing the prophet. But for whom is Mohammed a prophet? Only for those who believe in Islam. That point applies to all religious symbols. Something is always a symbol for a certain person; what is a symbol for one is not for the other. Take a heathen like me: for me, neither the cross nor the prophet Mohammed symbolizes anything. The former is one thing and the latter is a human. The Sikhs in India may consider the turban as their religious symbol, but that is neither the case for me nor for a Protestant. Requirement to repent Something is only a religious symbol within the confines of a particular religion. Outside, it no longer has the same symbolic value. What then does it mean to demand that non-Muslims respect Mohammed? Is it a requirement to recognize him as a religious symbol or as a prophet? In that case, it comes down to a requirement to convert to Islam. Without that step, Mohammed can never become a religious symbol or a prophet to me and any other non-Muslim. What then is the significance of the complaint that the film \u0026ldquo;pokes fun at the prophet\u0026rdquo; and that one should not do that? Muslims argue that depicting the prophet Mohammed is profane, because the prophet has forbidden depictions of himself and Allah. The answer is simple: the prophet\u0026rsquo;s words are only valid for those who accept him as a prophet. This rule has no power for non-Muslims. But the question is: are we doing something immoral by not “respecting” their sense of profane? To answer that, we need to expand our perspective. To this day, some Protestants openly criticize Catholics by calling the Pope “the Antichrist”, portraying the Catholic Church as “the devil\u0026rsquo;s church”, and condemning Catholics as “devil worshipers”. Europe had decades of wars over it. To this day those central theses of Protestantism remain profane to the Catholics, just as the existence of Catholicism itself remains profane to many Protestants. What should we do if it is said that one group should not do what the other considers profane? As an Indian, I look with even more amazement at the demands of the protesting Muslims. For centuries it has been at the core of Islam to describe Indian traditions (Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism) as idolatry and false demonic religion. According to Islam, Hindus worship Satan and his companions: their elephant god Ganesha, the adulterous Krishna or the phallic Shiva. That image is still current. Are such statements about the gods of India not offensive? Can one then demand that Muslims deny their basic doctrines on idolatry, God and Satan? If Islam did that, it would end its own existence as a religion. In other words, from a pagan perspective, the existence of a religion such as Islam (or Christianity) is itself “sacrilege.” The core of these religions transforms millions of people in Asia into idol worshipers and worshipers of the devil. Muslims must be consistent: if they don\u0026rsquo;t want people to blaspheme their religion, they shouldn\u0026rsquo;t do it themselves to other religions and traditions. Superior to all In fact, if they are not willing to accept this conclusion, then the protesting Muslims’ claim comes down to this: the world must treat them as an exceptional religious community, equal to none and superior to all. Of course they believe that is the case. That is precisely why that belief is unacceptable to the rest of the world. The whole debate is not about “respect for other religions,” or “freedom of speech.” It is about a religious group, which considers itself superior to everyone else, demanding that all the world endorse the truth of this belief. Who is willing to do that? Not me in any case.\n","tags":[],"title":"It's not about respect for religion","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/its-not-about-respect-for-religion/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","ignorance"],"content":"I I face some difficulties in giving a \u0026lsquo;yes\u0026rsquo; or \u0026rsquo;no\u0026rsquo; answer to your question because I am not sure how to understand \u0026lsquo;Samsara\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;Jnana\u0026rsquo; and its Sanskrit negation \u0026lsquo;Ajnana\u0026rsquo;, and \u0026lsquo;moksha\u0026rsquo;. It is equally unclear whether there are differences of import between being \u0026rsquo;the root\u0026rsquo; and being \u0026rsquo;the cause\u0026rsquo;, as far as the relation between \u0026lsquo;Ajnana\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;Samsara\u0026rsquo; are concerned. \u0026lsquo;Maaya\u0026rsquo; is another notion used in the Indian traditions, at times as a synonym for \u0026lsquo;ajnana\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;avidya\u0026rsquo;, at times as the \u0026lsquo;cause\u0026rsquo; of \u0026lsquo;Ajnana\u0026rsquo;. To illustrate my difficulties, consider two ways of understanding, say, \u0026lsquo;Ajnana\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;Moksha\u0026rsquo;. If \u0026lsquo;Ajnana\u0026rsquo; is ignorance (understood as absence of knowledge) then \u0026lsquo;Jnana\u0026rsquo; does NOT have its opposite nature. The reason is not far to seek: ignorance, because it is determined as the absence of knowledge, does not possess any qualities or properties. (Something has to exist before it can have any properties.) Therefore, \u0026lsquo;jnana\u0026rsquo; cannot possess a nature that is the opposite of \u0026lsquo;ajnana\u0026rsquo;. So, ipso facto, we cannot claim that \u0026lsquo;jnana\u0026rsquo; is the only solution. If we insist on speaking about \u0026lsquo;opposite nature\u0026rsquo;, consider the argument that anything that merely exists has \u0026rsquo;the opposite\u0026rsquo; property of \u0026lsquo;Ajnana\u0026rsquo; by the facticity of its existence. From this it follows that, if the only way to \u0026lsquo;break\u0026rsquo; ajana requires the presence of something that has its opposite \u0026rsquo;nature\u0026rsquo;, then any and every object that exists in the world can break \u0026lsquo;ajnana\u0026rsquo;. Suppose that \u0026lsquo;Ajnana\u0026rsquo; is a positive force of some sort. To suggest that \u0026lsquo;only something that has an opposite force can break it\u0026rsquo; requires argument, evidence or some kind of proof. One could equally well suggest that \u0026lsquo;jnana\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;ajnana\u0026rsquo; meet other and neutralize one another; or that they both destroy each other; or that they combine to produce something that is entirely new; and so on. Each view has a plausible analogue in the world. Therefore, it depends on the plausibility of these analogies in order to accept that \u0026lsquo;jnana\u0026rsquo; is the only solution. Consider now the notion of \u0026lsquo;moksha\u0026rsquo;. One could argue that this is attainable only at the end of a life of a person. If this position is accepted, then the claim that \u0026lsquo;jnana\u0026rsquo; leads to \u0026lsquo;moksha\u0026rsquo; has the same status as the claim that \u0026lsquo;Nishkama karma\u0026rsquo;, or \u0026lsquo;bhakti\u0026rsquo;, or \u0026lsquo;yoga\u0026rsquo; or \u0026rsquo;tapas\u0026rsquo;, or \u0026lsquo;puja\u0026rsquo; or whatever else leads to \u0026lsquo;moksha\u0026rsquo; as well. Therefore, one cannot defend the claim that \u0026lsquo;only jnana\u0026rsquo; leads to moksha. Let us suppose that \u0026lsquo;moksha\u0026rsquo; can be attained during the course of a person\u0026rsquo;s life. In that case, \u0026lsquo;moksha\u0026rsquo; could be a state of mind, the way one lives, the manner in which one goes about with mundane things, an orientation, or a path one follows, and so on. If this is the case, then one cannot claim that \u0026lsquo;jnana\u0026rsquo; is the only path that leads to \u0026lsquo;moksha\u0026rsquo;: there are multiple ways to arrive at a state of mind, come to a certain way of living, learn a manner of going about with mundane things, developing an orientation or even to tread a path. Even here, arguments are absent to suggest that \u0026lsquo;jnana\u0026rsquo; is the only path to \u0026lsquo;moksha\u0026rsquo;. You see, the above is merely a hurried sample of the kind of difficulties we face, if we insist (today) on using Sanskrit words while conducting discussions about issues of great importance that the Indian traditions have been tackling over the millennia. Then we would simply (at the very best) reproduce old debates (of centuries ago) without solving any of the problems we confront. Hence my suggestion: let us leave the Sanskrit words aside; let us recreate the problem-situation of yesteryears in the languages and idioms of the twenty-first century. Let us see how many of these problems continue to make sense to us when we accept physics, chemistry, biology, logic, etc. that we know and take for granted. Of course, it is possible that some of these disputes will continue to exist even under such a reconstruction. But, if they do, they will enrich our lives instead of simply leading to semantic difficulties (at best) and linguistic squabbles (at worst) as is the case if you and I discuss in English using Sanskrit words. II You ask: \u0026ldquo;Ajnana is an absense with respect to a single entity *jnana* while shunya or void is an absense with respect to anything or everything. How can they be equated? How can, for example, your absense be the same as my absense?\u0026rdquo; Using knowledge as the translation of \u0026lsquo;Jnana\u0026rsquo;, what I say is this. Knowledge is always of something or another, i.e., it is about something specific in the world. Its negation, I use the notion of ignorance as a translation for \u0026lsquo;Ajnana\u0026rsquo;, suggests that there is no such knowledge. (In the context of this discussion, knowledge is about one\u0026rsquo;s true nature. It is an answer to the question \u0026lsquo;who am I?\u0026rsquo;) Many false statements can be given as an answer to this question, but there is NO correct answer to give, if one does not have the correct answer. That is to say, that person does not have (or possess) knowledge. In this sense, knowledge is non-existent as far as that person is concerned. If ignorance is used to characterize the absence of knowledge (or the absence of the true and correct answer), then this \u0026lsquo;absence\u0026rsquo; is like the empty set: knowledge simply does not exist (as far as that individual is concerned). All objects and entities that do not exist are on par: one cannot distinguish between non-existent objects because we distinguish objects from each other on the basis of some or another property. However, an object should exist for it to possess or have properties. As a consequence, there is only one empty set. (All possible but non-existent objects sit in this empty set, to put it a bit paradoxically. There are philosophically very interesting works written on non-existent objects; but I am not entering this terrain for the time being. There are also very thought-provoking philosophical writings on \u0026rsquo;negative facts\u0026rsquo;, i.e., \u0026lsquo;facts\u0026rsquo; that are not true. But I do not need them as yet for my research.) Consider the city of Bremen in Germany today. Neither you nor I are present there; neither is Kannan, or Arun or Divya. In fact, all the human beings who ever lived on earth are absent from Bremen; for that matter, so are all the people who are not in Bremen today. How to make sense of the claim that the absence of these people have differential impacts on the city of Bremen? As far as I am concerned, I cannot. While our individual presence in the city of Bremen would have a differential impact on the city, the absence of all the people who are not in Bremen today has exactly the same impact: nothing. (Of course, some person in Bremen might have taken to excessive drinking because his/her loved one is absent from Bremen today. However, the impact is made by the person who is in the city and not by the one who is absent.) Our respective absences from some place or another might affect different people differently. But that does not mean that my absence and your absence are different KINDS of absences. We are absent. Period. You further ask: \u0026ldquo;The biggest problem with considering Ajnana as a positive existence is the dictum - \u0026ldquo;That which exists can never cease to be\u0026rdquo;. If ignorance is some sort of existence, then how can it ever be got rid of? Existence can never cease to be but can be transformed. I don’t understand what transforming avidya could mean. I still dont understand why an absense cannot be a cause? I agree it cannot be a material cause but what about instrumental cause?\u0026rdquo; In the first place, the notion of existence used in this dictum is technical in nature; it is a term of the art. Second, this dictum is \u0026rsquo;true\u0026rsquo; only by virtue of definition. Therefore, argument is not possible: it will be an interminable conflict between \u0026lsquo;my definition\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;your definition\u0026rsquo; without there being a way to settle the disputes. What I am saying about \u0026lsquo;causes\u0026rsquo; is simply this. If something has to bring something else about, then it must exist in this world. In some senses, I am leaving everything vague, when I make this claim: I am not advancing any philosophical thesis about what it means \u0026rsquo;to bring about something\u0026rsquo;, what the \u0026lsquo;world\u0026rsquo; encompasses, and what \u0026rsquo;existence\u0026rsquo; is. I leave them vague because I would not like a philosophical thesis to lay down beforehand what any of these terms mean. I would like theories about the world to start explicating the meaning of these words. Until such time, I work with very loose suggestions that are intuitively communicable but not necessarily true by virtue of that. My intuitive idea tells me that objects, forces, powers, etc. need to be a part of this world (\u0026rsquo;exist\u0026rsquo;, in this intuitive sense), if they have to bring about some change (\u0026lsquo;cause\u0026rsquo;, in this intuitive sense) in the world. May be, the physicists will (one day) come up with a theory that this claim is not necessarily true for the Cosmos but holds only for certain domains. Even in such a case, I need a theory about how something that is non-existent can cause a change in the world, if one uses it to account for how ignorance prevents the emergence of knowledge (when ignorance is conceptualized as the absence of knowledge). Until such stage, I would like to work with the idea that if ignorance actively prevents the emergence of knowledge then that is because ignorance is a positive force of some sort and not merely the absence of knowledge. I am not sure what you want to say with the distinction between \u0026lsquo;material\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;instrumental\u0026rsquo; cause in this context. As far as I am concerned, before something can be a cause (in the sense I just explained), no matter what kind of cause, it has to be a part of this world. III In some senses, we are wandering away from the question the thread raised: is it the case that there is only one path to the enlightenment, namely through knowledge (of the Upanishads)? More specifically, do the puranic stories simplify the insights of the Upanishads? My answer to it was in the negative. The questions you raise in your last post, it appears to me, is an attempt by you to figure out from within the framework of some or another system of Indian thinking (let us, for the moment, call it Indian philosophy) what I am saying. I am not sure that such an attempt is going to be very productive. A better way would be to choose common problems and see what the respective answers are and find out which one of them is better suited for our purposes. Despite the above reservation, here are my answers to your queries. I shall use a slightly different format for my answers this time. You say: \u0026ldquo;But the point is this - who is making the statement \u0026ldquo;people are in ajnana\u0026rdquo;? it has to be a jnani. if everybody were ajnanis then there wouldn’t be a concept of ajnana. So only a jnani can make sense of ajnana.\u0026rdquo; The above claims are entirely context dependent. In some kinds of contexts, one can say that \u0026lsquo;people are ignorant\u0026rsquo;, include oneself in the category of \u0026lsquo;people\u0026rsquo;, without having knowledge. That is, one can speak about ignorance of \u0026lsquo;people\u0026rsquo; (including one\u0026rsquo;s own) without requiring that one has knowledge. For instance, in statements of the following sort, \u0026lsquo;we do not know much about how the brain works\u0026rsquo;; \u0026lsquo;we do not have an understanding of the mechanisms for the spread of cancer\u0026rsquo;; \u0026lsquo;we do not know whether elementary arithmetic is consistent\u0026rsquo; etc., we do speak of ignorance without it entailing that the speaker has knowledge. In other kinds of contexts, one can speak only of other\u0026rsquo;s ignorance even if one is more ignorant than the other: \u0026lsquo;he claims to be a physicist but does not know much about physics. Witness how he fell flat when I asked him to explain (this or that)\u0026quot;. In yet other kinds of contexts, one\u0026rsquo;s knowledge is the basis of characterizing other\u0026rsquo;s ignorance: \u0026ldquo;Even though he speaks Kannada fluently, he does not know its grammar. He could not parse words according to Kannada Sandhi rules.\u0026rdquo; And so on. When you say that if everyone were to be ignorant, there would be no concept of ignorance. I am not sure how to interpret this sentence. There are many domains I am ignorant about, and I know I am ignorant about those domains. You seem to suggest that the logic of the word \u0026lsquo;Ajnana\u0026rsquo; entails that there can be no knowledge of one\u0026rsquo;s own ignorance (or about the limit of one\u0026rsquo;s own knowledge). It could be the case that the notion of \u0026lsquo;Ajnana\u0026rsquo; has this logical and semantic property; I do not know. In that case, I would be very curious to discover why the theorem \u0026lsquo;p knows X entails that p knows that p knows X\u0026rsquo; would be invalid in Indian philosophies. Or, it could be the case that you are suggesting something entirely different. \u0026lsquo;If I do not know the true nature of my \u0026lsquo;self\u0026rsquo; then it entails that I do not know that I do not know\u0026rsquo;. If this is the case, then it has more to do with the nature of the \u0026lsquo;I\u0026rsquo; (and the \u0026lsquo;self\u0026rsquo;) than with either knowledge or ignorance. Even here, there is a problem: how do we understand the quest for our \u0026rsquo;true\u0026rsquo; nature then? I can ask myself the question \u0026lsquo;who am I?\u0026rsquo; and go in search of answers precisely because I do not know the answer and know that I do not know (the answer). You say further only the knowledgeable can make \u0026lsquo;sense\u0026rsquo; of ignorance. I lose you here. If ignorance is the absence of knowledge, what does it mean to make \u0026lsquo;sense\u0026rsquo; of ignorance? Absence of knowledge is neither \u0026lsquo;sensible\u0026rsquo; nor ‘nonsensical\u0026rsquo;. Ignorance itself is not a sentence (or a proposition) even if we use a sentence to speak about someone\u0026rsquo;s ignorance. Your analogy is not a happy one. The relationship between boredom and the TV does not mirror the relationship between \u0026lsquo;Jnana\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;Ajnana\u0026rsquo;. The latter is the negation (in logical terms) of the former, which is not the case with respect to TV and boredom. You can draw a logical conclusion using an analogy and apply it another domain, if the (logical) relationship between the elements in the former mirrors the logical relationship between the elements in the latter. You say, \u0026ldquo;To such a jnani, ajnana which is an absense of what he possesses (jnana) can very well be a cause.\u0026rdquo; I do not see what makes you suggest this. Note that the absence of knowledge about some X could also mean the presence of wrong ideas about that X. So, when the \u0026lsquo;Jnani\u0026rsquo; explains the \u0026lsquo;Ajnani\u0026rsquo; in terms of \u0026lsquo;Ajnana\u0026rsquo;, what he is doing is the following: he explains the \u0026lsquo;Ajnani\u0026rsquo; in terms of the wrong ideas s/he has but not by appealing to the \u0026lsquo;causal powers\u0026rsquo; of what is absent. That is, the \u0026lsquo;Jnani\u0026rsquo; says of the \u0026lsquo;Ajnani\u0026rsquo; that the latter believes, for instance, that his/her body is his/her \u0026rsquo;true\u0026rsquo; self, or that s/he thinks that s/he is the agent, or that s/he identifies her/his \u0026rsquo;true\u0026rsquo; self with money, beauty, power, etc. The \u0026lsquo;Jnani\u0026rsquo; might even \u0026lsquo;summarize\u0026rsquo; the explanation thus: s/he acts that way in the world because of \u0026lsquo;Ajnana\u0026rsquo;. But this summary is exactly that: a summary and not, in itself, an explanation which appeals to an absence acting causally in the world. IV Neither your analogy nor your argument is apt but I shall simply accept both for the time being. You say, to begin with, that there could be no concept of \u0026lsquo;blindness\u0026rsquo; if all were to be blind. I do not know what makes you say this. We are not telepathic, our physics tells us that telekinesis is not possible, or that we cannot levitate, and so on. But that has not prevented us from having concepts about any of these. Since when do facts about the world act as restraints on human imagination? (Our Puranic stories are the best illustrations of my claim; just read about the powers that Rishis are supposed to have.) And then you talk about blindness as a fictitious force. I lose you here. Why is this \u0026lsquo;fictitious\u0026rsquo;? We are \u0026lsquo;blind\u0026rsquo; to (i.e., we cannot see) infrared rays, electric and magnetic fields, and so on. In what sense is this blindness fictitious? This blindness is not a force, fictitious or otherwise. It merely spells out the limitations of human vision. Consider this. We hear sounds only on certain wavelengths. The dogs can hear sounds that we cannot. So, when a dog trainer blows a whistle that emits sounds we cannot hear, am I to assume that the dog reacts to \u0026lsquo;fictitious\u0026rsquo; sounds? Or that our deafness for this whistle is a \u0026lsquo;fictitious force\u0026rsquo;? It is not at all clear to me what you are defending, why you are defending what you are, and what would happen if it turns out to be indefensible. V Your posts continue to puzzle me. On the one hand, you make absolute claims about the limits of human imagination, namely, that it \u0026ldquo;CAN ONLY be a permutation and combination of our experiences\u0026rdquo;. On the other, you contradict yourself by speaking about the 4th dimension, which is beyond our experience, and which, you say, human beings cannot imagine. How did anybody come up with the notion and the mathematics of 4 dimensions if it could not be imagined? Would you like to say that quantum physics, the n-dimensional mathematics, etc. are not products of human imagination and that, say, they are products of human creativity? That is to say, are you defining \u0026lsquo;human imagination\u0026rsquo; as that which cannot go beyond the macro-experiences we have? If this is the case, there is no point to a discussion because it becomes a dispute about definitions of words. However, even under this interpretation, we CAN HAVE NOTIONS of blindness and vision (as products of human creativity) in the same way we have so many notions (and theories), which far outstrip anything our macro-world experience can provide us with. Thus, I am puzzled. VI X says: \u0026ldquo;Lets suppose there is a prisoner who has been in prison all his life. To him, that is how things are. He does not feel any limitations on freedom. He is free as it can be. Now to an outside observer, this prisoner \u0026lsquo;seems\u0026rsquo; to be constrained. But this \u0026lsquo;constraint\u0026rsquo; which is the cause of his limitation is only in the outside observer\u0026rsquo;s mind not prisoner\u0026rsquo;s. So, there is \u0026lsquo;constraint\u0026rsquo; from a certain frame of reference which is \u0026lsquo;causing\u0026rsquo; limitations to the prisoners freedoms. But this can only be an *appearance* of a cause and not a real cause because the \u0026lsquo;constraint\u0026rsquo; comes into existence only from a certain frame of reference (outside) but not to the prisioner. So this \u0026lsquo;constraint\u0026rsquo; is both existence (from outside) and absence (for the prisoner). how can such an entity cause? I think it is just an appearance of a cause in the descriptions from a certain frame of reference.\u0026rdquo; With the example of a prisoner, you are confusing issues. There is a difference between (a) the existence of things; (b) a particular description of the world which provides us with \u0026lsquo;causes\u0026rsquo;; (c) and some other description of the world. We might, if we so choose, take something that exists and identify it as a \u0026lsquo;cause\u0026rsquo;. You seem to suggest that something or another is a \u0026lsquo;cause\u0026rsquo; accordingly as whether or not there exists a description, which shows that something is a \u0026lsquo;cause\u0026rsquo;. For the sake of argument, I am willing to buy this. In that case, though, you cannot speak about \u0026lsquo;apparent causes\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;real causes\u0026rsquo;. (You cannot, because the distinction between \u0026lsquo;appearance\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;reality\u0026rsquo; has nothing to do with whether or not something is a cause in a particular description of the world.) Nor can you speak about their \u0026rsquo;existence\u0026rsquo;. (Because, the notion of \u0026lsquo;cause\u0026rsquo; is defined with respect to the place some concept occupies in a description of the world and NOT with respect to its position in the world.) You will have to say: something is a cause, if there is a causal description that makes something into a cause. The confusion is simply this: you speak as though the \u0026lsquo;presence of a concept AS A CAUSE\u0026rsquo; is identical to the \u0026rsquo;existence of an entity\u0026rsquo;. This confusion arises because you use the word \u0026rsquo;existence\u0026rsquo; in two senses: (a) as that entity which is; (b) as that concept which occupies a particular place in a description. The PRESENCE of some concept in a particular description does not guarantee the EXISTENCE of an object named by that concept anymore than the absence of that concept in another description of the world furnishes us with proof about the absence of the said object. I am interested in understanding the Indian traditions. I would like to know whether I can formulate their problem is such a way that I can also recreate their debates. In one sense, our discussion suggests that it is possible: you recognize my formulation problem enough to come up with a defence of \u0026lsquo;jnana\u0026rsquo;. I suppose that is enough for the time being. As you say, we will continue our debates when we meet each other.\n","tags":[],"title":"agyana: existence or absence","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/agyana-existence-or-absence/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","enlightenment"],"content":"I I think that the multiple routes that exist in the Indian culture and those that individuals follow are on par with each other. From within any one of these, the other routes appear as moments. However, this does not privilege any one route above the other. If one were to suggest, say, that the Puranic stories are simplifications of the Upanishadic insights then one has to endorse a claim of the following sort. What makes some sets of sentences into a simplification of other sets of sentences is that the former leaves out nuances, qualifications, conditionalities, and so on of the latter. That is to say, the simplification is less true (or more conditionally true) than the complex version. In this way we would get a hierarchy of statements (from complex to the simple), where each succeeding simplification is less true than the predecessor. Only the statement at the apex of such a pyramid would be the truest of the lot. Then, we would have but one set of true statements. Relative to this set, all other statements would be false. In such a case, there would be no plurality of traditions. There would be but one \u0026rsquo;true\u0026rsquo; path; all other paths would not lead us to the same goal as the true one does. Not only that. Under such a construction, enlightenment would not be something that all human beings could strive for and achieve; only \u0026lsquo;some\u0026rsquo; (those who are able to understand the Upanishadic claims) could do so. Consequently, one has to add a rider: only some people (endowed only in one particular way) could find happiness (eudaimonia, enlightenment). The strength of the Indian traditions lies, amongst other things, in their unconditional claim: all human beings can find happiness. The differences between human beings (no matter whether this difference is biological, sociological, psychological in nature) matter only when it comes to the choice of the path best suited for them. If this statement is true, then the Puranic stories cannot be, under any interpretation of the word, simplifications of more complex claims. II I cannot quite figure out whether we are talking about different things or expressing differing points of view or simply using different words. I am talking about two contrast sets: \u0026lsquo;simplification\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;complexity\u0026rsquo;, whereas you seem to talk about \u0026lsquo;simplicity\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;complication\u0026rsquo; (also at times using \u0026lsquo;complex\u0026rsquo; as a synonym for \u0026lsquo;complicated\u0026rsquo;). You are right that simplification and complexity apply to descriptions; that is why I spoke of both of them in terms of \u0026lsquo;sets of sentences\u0026rsquo; (in some language or another). Let me explain what I mean. If there is a \u0026lsquo;simple\u0026rsquo; and a \u0026lsquo;complicated\u0026rsquo; explanation available to me, and they are alternatives in the sense that they do more or less the same job in explaining what needs to be explained, then I would prefer a simple to a complicated explanation. Here, the difference between these two explanations resides in the fact that the complicated explanation uses more concepts than the simple one does but both do the same job. (Let us leave aside why I choose a simple explanation; the reasons have to do with my philosophical preferences.) In the case of a \u0026lsquo;simplified\u0026rsquo; and a \u0026lsquo;complex\u0026rsquo; explanation, the situation is different. The simplified set of statements (mostly) makes use of non-technical vocabulary to get across the point of a complex explanation. The simplification leaves aside qualifications, presuppositions, conditions, etc. which are all required for the explanation to really explain some phenomenon or another. (Elegantly written popularizing books on physics, biology, chemistry, etc. belong to the class of simplifications of complex explanations.) So, all a layperson like me needs is a book that simplifies the complex explanations of the physicists about blackholes, of the geneticists about gene-sequencing, etc. in order for me to get some idea of what these physicists and geneticists are doing. Unlike a text-book in physics or in genetics, these popularizing books that simplify complex ideas DO NOT enable me to do physics or genetics. Instead, they make use of the rich resources of a natural language (similes, metaphors, analogies, examples, jokes, etc.) to get an idea approximately across to someone like me who lacks the technical expertise in the area or domain under consideration. Now comes the question of the relationship between the Upanishadic statements and Puranic stories. If, as you seem to suggest now and then in your post to me, it is the case that Puranic stories tell me \u0026ldquo;in simple terms\u0026rdquo; something that the Upanishads make \u0026ldquo;complicated\u0026rdquo; (or render the same in \u0026lsquo;abstruse\u0026rsquo; terms, as you put it), then my choice is clear: go for the Puranic stories all the way. Under this construal, Puranic stories are alternatives to the Upanishadic claims. I do not believe this to be the case. Do the puranic stories simplify the complex claims of the Upanishads? If they did, analogous to what I said above, the puranic stories could not help me attain enlightenment, much the same way a popularizing book on modern day physics does not enable me to do research in physics today. Then, the only way I can do physics is by learning physics; similarly the only way to attain enlightenment would be to understand the Upanishads. I do not buy this either. That is why I do not think that Puranic stories are simplifications of the Upanishads. III Question: The relationship between the Puranas and the Upanishads with regards to simplification need not necessarily be of the type Popular Science Books : Physics Text Books. It could be of the type Undergraduate Physics Text Books : Graduate Physics Text Books. They could be dealing with same subject, but the coverage, depth, and rigour could be different. But both will help one learn Physics and do Physics. A good point, even though it is not entirely clear to me what that point does to my argument. Therefore, let me think aloud and consider two ways in which undergraduate textbooks in physics help you to do physics. Let us suppose you learn Snell\u0026rsquo;s law of refraction, Maxwell\u0026rsquo;s law of electro-magnetism and, say, an introductory chapter on Nuclear physics. Let us say that you also do some laboratory experiments on the first two. No doubt, you are learning to do physics now. Do they help you do research on Nuclear physics immediately thereafter? Today, their function is entirely different: they are propaedeutics, courses that provide you with an introduction to the subject. They help you acquire the necessary apparatus to learn more and go deeper into the subject. They are not simplifications of complex explanations but ones that provide you with some rudimentary notions, using which you can learn other concepts. When you learn about the atomic value of an element in Chemistry, this piece of knowledge does not simplify. You merely learn that elements have atomic values and you might also learn something about what that word means. You will come across the idea of electrons, their orbits and nucleus. You are taught that electrons can be excited but you also learn that it has something to do with energy. In other words, the undergraduate texts prepare you for research; you do as laboratory experiments what research was to your predecessors. In this sense, because the frontier of knowledge keeps moving, the nature and kind of preparation required to do research also keeps shifting. Do the Puranic stories have a similar propaedutic function with respect to the Upanishads? If they do, then you are suggesting something like the following: enlightenment consists of vertical hierarchy of knowledge elements and that one can become enlightened if and only if one has gone through the phase of undergraduation. If you want to argue this, then you are committed to saying that there is only one route to enlightenment. The other paths train you to tread the Upanishadic path. \u0026lsquo;All routes lead to Jnana\u0026rsquo; and only though that can you achieve enlightenment. Three things require noting in this regard. One is that this is a description that those who follow this path provide with regard to other paths: all other paths are moments in one\u0026rsquo;s own path. While this could be true of one\u0026rsquo;s own development, it overlooks the fact that disciples of the other paths say exactly the same thing with respect to their own path. The second thing is that it makes enlightenment \u0026lsquo;conditional\u0026rsquo; upon possessing some specific ability or another. In the same way not every undergraduate student in physics can go on to do research in physics, it suggests that only some can attain enlightenment. The third thing is that such a position cannot account for the rivalry between the different Indian traditions: their rivalry is not at the level of a competition between different undergraduate texts, namely, which of the paths brings you to the path of \u0026lsquo;jnana\u0026rsquo; quicker and better. Instead, they claim that they all help you in achieving enlightenment and that \u0026lsquo;jnana\u0026rsquo; itself is but one of the paths to enlightenment. Let me now consider the following question: is there any way of deciding which kind of research in physics is better? That is to say, is research in Plasma physics better than research in solid state physics, or doing research in astrophysics? The only way of making sense of this question is to relativize it to an individual\u0026rsquo;s concern of wanting to know the area in which s/he should do research: In which area do I want to do research and why? The multiple paths to human happiness is something analogous to the above situation, as I see the issue. Being happy or enlightened (as you know, I use these two words as synonyms) is like doing research in physics. It is not an \u0026rsquo;end state\u0026rsquo;; it is a goal only in the sense of \u0026lsquo;doing research in physics\u0026rsquo; can be our goal. Whether you do research in plasma physics or solid state physics, you are doing research in physics; in the same way, Upanishads and puranas help you find happiness. There is no hierarchy of any sort between them. IV I intended to speak of \u0026ldquo;two ways in which undergraduate textbooks in physics help you to do physics\u0026rdquo; but ended up writing only about one way. Here is the second of the two ways I wanted to consider. Assume, for a moment, that both Upanishads and Puranas are propaedeutics to \u0026ldquo;doing research\u0026rdquo;, i.e., to be happy. Could we then compare them and say which one of them is better? Though I cannot answer this question on the basis of my experience, I think even the enlightened would face the following issue, which I have often faced in my career. When you have acquired the competence in some domain and are doing further research, people often ask you for a \u0026ldquo;good text book\u0026rdquo;. I find this an extremely difficult question to answer. The reason is this: I find a text book a \u0026lsquo;good one\u0026rsquo;, if it gives me (the experienced researcher) a very good overview of my field of research, beginning with (what I consider) rudimentary ideas. However, I have discovered (through my own experience) that what is a \u0026lsquo;good text book\u0026rsquo; to me is more often than not a \u0026lsquo;very bad text book\u0026rsquo;, if you look at it from a pedagogical point of view. One who begins learning a new field requires another kind of introduction than what I would consider a \u0026lsquo;good introduction\u0026rsquo;. As an experienced researcher, I find a systematic overview of my domain a \u0026lsquo;good introduction\u0026rsquo;; those who begin to learn a new domain require a good introduction to learn and not a \u0026lsquo;systematic overview\u0026rsquo;. Our requirements are different. That is also the reason why writing a \u0026lsquo;good text book\u0026rsquo; (or being a teacher) is not something every good researcher can do. Only some can be good teachers; only a few can write good text books. In this sense, I believe that even the enlightened would face analogous problems. Some might find some or another Upanishad a \u0026lsquo;good introduction\u0026rsquo;; some find that just one of the Mahavakyas is enough; yet others find the puranic stories sublime. The only one who can decide about it is the student. What helps him/her to find happiness is the thing that works for that person. More, one cannot say. V You ask what I mean by this: Three things require noting in this regard. One is that this is a description that those who follow this path provide with regard to other paths: all other paths are moments in one\u0026rsquo;s own path. While this could be true of one\u0026rsquo;s own development, it overlooks the fact that disciples of the other paths say exactly the same thing with respect to their own path.\u0026quot; What I mean: Bhakti, for instance, claims that it is the best path to enlightenment because both the \u0026lsquo;Karma\u0026rsquo; and the \u0026lsquo;jnana\u0026rsquo; path are the subordinate moments of Bhakti. (I speak about this more in detail in my “How to speak for the Indian traditions\u0026quot; article.) All I want to suggest is that teach path (karmic, Jnana, Bhakti, yogic, Tantric, meditative, etc) is special to the practitioner and S/he sees in it the presence of all other paths. We need to account for this stance Why I say this in the context of the discussion: let us, for the time being, associate puranic stories with the practice of puja, and consider this too as a path to enlightenment. Were we to say that one does not achieve enlightenment through this manner and claim that only \u0026lsquo;jnana\u0026rsquo; leads one to enlightenment, then we cannot account for the claim (that many in our traditions make) that illiterate people, with their simple practice of doing a daily puja to some vigraha or another (or even to trees), also achieve enlightenment. In our accounts of and attempts at understanding enlightenment, we need to account for these claims. (We could account for them by saying they are false; but I take them seriously.) You ask: \u0026ldquo;But what\u0026rsquo;s wrong with believing that only some can attain enlightenment? No-one\u0026rsquo;s claiming that some people are being forcibly shut out. Technically speaking, enlightenment is open to all. But to me your view is analogous to saying that everyone can be an opera singer or a fabulous dancer.\u0026rdquo; One\u0026rsquo;s ability to become an opera singer or a fabulous dancer is conditional: it depends on one\u0026rsquo;s biological inheritance and one\u0026rsquo;s aptitude, among other things. It also depends on one\u0026rsquo;s skill and practice; one\u0026rsquo;s teachers and so on. Human happiness, according to how I understand the Indian traditions, is accessible to all. Every one of us can be happy. Not merely \u0026rsquo;technically\u0026rsquo;, as you put it, but also in reality. The fact, however, that all of us are not happy has led the Indian traditions to investigate things that stand in the way of human happiness. It has also made them discover various means and modalities to overcome these impediments. All human beings, if they seek happiness, can really become happy. The possibility of achieving this goal does not depend on some kind of \u0026lsquo;moral luck\u0026rsquo;, the way being an opera singer or a fabulous dancer does. \u0026ldquo;Seek, and ye shall find\u0026rdquo;, our traditions seem to say. (I speak about these things more in detail in the talk I gave at the Catholic University of Louvain.) Finding happiness is not a question of accident or luck; it is the guaranteed result of a search. Is Enlightenment different from happiness? Well, here one chooses one\u0026rsquo;s own terminology, I guess. The happiness that I speak about is what Aristotle called \u0026lsquo;Eudaimonia\u0026rsquo;: as that which if a person has, s/he will never lose. There might be more to enlightenment than happiness, as defined above. However, I do believe that enlightenment is the only \u0026lsquo;property\u0026rsquo; which, if you once have it, you will never lose. No other human quality has this nature.\n","tags":[],"title":"Moral luck and gyanodaya","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/moral-luck-and-gyanodaya/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","books"],"content":"Here is a new book by S. N. Balagangadhara and Sarika Rao: What does it mean to be \u0026lsquo;Indian\u0026rsquo;? US version can be had for $12.00; Indian version for Rs. 349. Here are the UK, Candian, EU versions. Any questions, comments are welcome and you can post it onhttps://groups.io/g/TheHeathenInHisBlindness This book tries to answer a question that is also its title. This book shares some of the results of 40 years of research in the Research Programme Comparative Science of Cultures. It plots the outlines of the differences that distinguish one culture from another, Indian and western in our case. The narrative does not track differences between nations, societies or religions but investigates domains like experience, sense of the past and constructions of the self to sketch a possible answer to the question. The book straddles the fields of social sciences and humanities to tackle issues of knowledge about culture and exhibits the relevance of these areas of enquiry to us all. It suggests an alternative to the ruling orthodoxies that constitute ‘identity politics’ today while showing that this label hides more content than even what their best proponents imagine. Written in a non-academic language and an accessible style, the book addresses an intelligent but lay public. Consequently, it contains neither many citations nor any references. However, what it conveys is based on a scientific research programme, whose results are published in scientific journals and research monographs. It also formulates interesting hypotheses currently under investigation. Today the question What does it mean to be ‘Indian’? faces difficulty. Is it a motto like ‘E Pluribus Unum’ or ‘satyameva jayate’? Is it a ‘colourful’ and ‘beautiful’ culture where people wear bindis, deck themselves in Kanchipuram Silk and do puja? Is it a question of national borders and territories? Or is it an institutional question: about educational institutions, courts of law, a huge parliament or even being the world’s ‘largest’ democracy? Do we belong to a culture of oppression, exploitation and conflict or do we aspire to draw the divine nectar by churning the ocean? Is there something ‘Indian’ about our culture that goes beyond the differences between Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs or Jains? What does it überhaupt mean to belong to Indian culture? Why ask this question today? Do we not know the answers? After all, as we know, a lot is written about India, her culture, her past, her society, the psychology and sociology of individuals and their groups. Why is that not enough to answer the query about what it means to be ‘Indian’? It is because what we have learnt about ourselves so far is either false or very fragmentary. Whether one claims that India is a class society or a caste society or a combination of both, one is not saying much. Such a claim merely tells us that India too has a society and that it either fully or partially mirrors other societies and people one way or another. Our question is not whether we are also human beings, whether we also have a social and cultural life, but what kind of people we are, where we are coming from and where should we head as a society, as a culture and as individuals. Thus, we ask: what does it mean to be ‘Indian’? In answering this question, this book transcends the distinction between ‘the right’ and ‘the left’ by looking deeper into ideas of human beings, society, culture, experience, past and other related clusters. One such element is the colonial past of India which is of relevance not merely to the colonised but to the coloniser as well. It is through the British that India is drawn into western culture, transforming both herself and the West in the process. In outlining its contours, the book shows why its question is relevant not just to the citizens of a country or to members of a culture but to all of us who consider ourselves human beings. Indian intellectuals have vacillated between virtue-signalling and moral indignation; they have completely given up all intellectual questions and responsibilities. This has resulted in a large, intelligent and educated populace that is hungry for insights that make sense of their world. This group, in India (and abroad), is fed up with being told that they ought to be ashamed of being Indian, of belonging to the \u0026rsquo;third world\u0026rsquo; and are no longer convinced that they ought to become as western as quickly as possible. Their numbers are growing by the day. This group ranges from the Millennials entering their thirties to the young retirees entering their sixties. This is the first generation of the middle class, which emerged in the 80s and 90s. These Millennials who grew up believing themselves to be ‘global citizens’ are now confronted with the inadequacy of the stories they have. ‘What does it mean to be an Indian, in the 21st century?’ is a question they are confronting as an actuality with real-world implications. This is a question raised at the level of culture and can only be answered at that level. Neither nationalism nor identity-politics are satisfactory. This book is sui generis and fills a lacuna that few have identified, let alone addressed. If Asian culture is not simply a slightly inferior, slightly idiosyncratic variant of European culture, as we have been told for a very long time, what else is it? Hence, the corollary question: What does it mean to be an Indian? The author can ask and answer this question because he has theorised on a larger question in his four decades of research: What makes a difference, any difference, into a cultural difference and not a social, psychological or biological difference? As of today, there is no competition. There are books that slice the question in old and familiar ways: religion, politics, spirituality, sociology etc. These familiar stories in their various permutations and combinations have not only grown stale but are demonstrably useless.\n","tags":[],"title":"New Book: What does it mean to be 'Indian'?","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/what-does-it-mean-to-be-indian/"},{"categories":["india-forum","Indian traditions","Jakob"],"content":"I will take up some of the general points, which I think are relevant to the Indian American community at large. First, let me say I am impressed by the dynamism present in this community. In spite of the demands of daily life, Indian Americans find the time and energy to engage in intellectual debates about the nature of their traditions. In spite of the discrimination and \u0026ldquo;religion oppression\u0026rdquo; [1] faced by them, there is a general sense of optimism about the future of these traditions. It is important that this dynamism remain a positive force. Some Indian Americans have adopted the name-calling that we find among certain American academics. Whereas the latter call anyone who dares say a few positive words about the Indian traditions \u0026ldquo;a Hindutva sycophant,\u0026rdquo; the former trend to label any western intellectual who dares question the dominant representations of the Indian traditions as a \u0026ldquo;Witzellian.\u0026rdquo; The legitimate discontent about the academic representation of the Indian traditions should not lead us to a general anti-intellectual stance. Anti-intellectualism knows only one endpoint: the Taliban. Now, if there is one community aware of the duty to avoid that society moves towards that point, it is the Indian American community. Since intellectuals share this sense of duty, our study of the Indian traditions should show how they can contribute to making American society a more tolerant, open-minded and happier society. As Chitra Raman affirms, the Indian traditions have been conceptualized in an extremely impoverished manner during the last few centuries. It is the hypothesis of our research group that this is the case because they have been viewed through a secularized biblical framework. [2] The same framework also puts conceptual limitations on the structure of American pluralism. This is not an assessment about the origins of this form of pluralism or a judgment about its biased nature, but rather a cognitive analysis of its contemporary structure. Such an analysis cannot be challenged by a moralizing judgement (e.g., that it justifies discrimination). The only way to really challenge my hypothesis is to develop another hypothesis about the structure of American pluralism. Naturally, its purpose is to develop new ways of solving the problems of pluralism in the U.S. To do so, one should indeed strive to bring American pluralism beyond its biblical straitjacket in the near future. Perhaps, no group is as qualified to do so as the Indian Americans. But before they can take up this task, they should understand the depth of the predicament. Even more so, they have to become aware that they have appropriated the secularized Christian conception of the Indian traditions as a self-description. The predicament we face is cognitive in nature: the currently dominant conception of the Indian traditions makes sense only against the background of the biblical framework. It is cognitive in the sense that the way we currently think and talk about “Hinduism” leads to a distortion of the very nature of the Indian traditions. This dominant conception of “Hinduism” does not describe these traditions themselves, but rather how they appear through western and Christian lenses. Yet many Indians and Indian Americans talk as though this conception makes eminent sense to them. Chitra Raman develops a nice analogy: it is like using the grammar of one language to understand another. One may adopt the words of the second language, but when one embeds them in the grammatical structure of the first language, one ends up with virtual gibberish. The analogy can be taken further: today, it is as though the native speakers of the second language have accepted the grammatical structure of the first language as the only correct one and they try to speak their own language in this way. This is the nature of our predicament: many Indians and Indian Americans have adopted the conceptual framework of Christianity to talk about their own traditions. They assume the Indian traditions are a belief system or religion with its own doctrines, commandments and rules. As I will try to show, this makes about as much sense as using the grammatical structure of one language to speak another completely different language. To avoid any misunderstanding, let it be clear that the denial that the Indian traditions are of the same nature as biblical religion does not involve any value judgement. They also have a highly-developed structure, but this is so different from Judaism, Christianity and Islam that it is impossible to maintain that the Indian traditions and the latter three are instances of the same kind. In fact, once we appreciate how different the Indian traditions are from these religions, we will rediscover how rich and valuable they really are. To return to the language analogy: if we used the grammatical structure of one language to speak another, we would not be able to understand this second language and would also ignore its rich contributions to literature, philosophy and poetry. It is only when we rediscover the structure of this second language that its treasures become available to us. Similarly, when we rediscover the nature of the Indian traditions and rescue them from being transformed into just another religion, we will be able to show how they have contributed to the pursuit of knowledge at a level undreamt of. The Priest and the Swami In Facing the Challenge of American Pluralism, I argued that the Indian traditions revolve around the exploring and examining of one’s experience so as to attain perfect happiness. What does this mean? How is it different from what religions like Christianity and Islam do? As an entry point, take a Hindu swamiji and a Christian priest. The priest says “God is a Trinity.” The swamiji says “Tat Tvam Asi.” What is the difference between the two? First the priest. The sentence “God is a Trinity” is a doctrine to him; it is a proposition about the world, which he takes to be absolutely true. Because it is a doctrine, the sentence is embedded in an elaborate theological system. It is related to other sentences that explain its true meaning: theological doctrines about Jesus being the Son of God and the Father, the Son and the Spirit being one substance, but three persons. Arguments have been developed to establish the truth of the Trinitarian doctrine. Its correct formulation was discussed and fixed at the First Council of Nicea in 325 AD. The result is the Nicene Creed: a set of beliefs that are held to reflect religious truth by most Christian denominations. As a Christian believer, when the priest says “God is a Trinity,” one is expected to accept this as a true belief, a doctrine embedded in a belief system that claims the one and only religious truth. As an orthodox Christian today, one should understand this doctrine, proclaim its truth and be able to defend it against its detractors. One should not question its truth and meaning. These have been fixed for good. Now the swamiji. When he states “Tat Tvam Asi,” does he expect all Hindus to accept this sentence as a true doctrine? Does he want them to take this as a true belief, whose truth they should proclaim and defend against the “false beliefs” of other religions? Does he expect them to memorize the sentence and its related doctrines and arguments, and repeat them until eternity? No, he does not. When the swamiji teaches, he takes into account the different levels and experiences of his audience. He will explain “Tat Tvam Asi” in different ways according to the different experiential levels of individuals. The sentence does not have one fixed true meaning, precisely because it functions as an instruction for exploring one’s own experience. It suggests that the distinction between I and not-I is a temporary figment that results from interpreting our experience in a particular way. If we examine this experience at a deeper level, we will slowly discover that there is no such distinction there. The swamiji’s explanation of the sentence will make sense to us, according to where we are on the path towards this discovery. Hence, neither the speech of the swamiji nor the texts of the Indian traditions can be understood as belief systems or doctrines, which have a fixed meaning and claim to reflect the one religious truth. They are “heuristics” that function as instructions for action to explore our own experience. To attain the insights embodied in these sentences, one has to examine them from all sides, relate them to one’s experience and question their truth repeatedly. Only in this way can they help us become better and happier human beings. The claim of the Indian traditions is not that we should accept them as true doctrines or that such acceptance is a precondition for attaining salvation. They do not postpone perfect happiness until after death. Neither do they claim that there is only one true path to attain this state. Rather, they claim that all human beings can attain perfect happiness here on earth and that there are countless ways to achieve this goal. Those who conceptualize the Indian traditions as “belief systems,” “doctrines” or “religion” take away the unique nature of these traditions. They make the rich storehouse of experiential knowledge embodied by these traditions inaccessible and do so by transforming them into a belief system, the Hindu equivalent of Christianity or Islam. Let it be clear that the Indian traditions are neither belief systems nor religions. They are far more fascinating than that. I refer you to the piece by my teacher S. N. Balagangadhara (soon to be published on the India Forum website) to get a glimpse of how rich these traditions are. Here, just note that it is precisely the way in which the Indian traditions are different from belief systems, which makes them into extremely important but uncharted contributions to the human pursuit of knowledge. Transforming the Swami into a Priest But what happens when we reduce the Indian traditions into a Hindu “religion,” “world view” or “belief system”? What are the consequences of transforming the swamiji into a priest? Why is this development so harmful?\nFirstly, it generates a tendency to trivialize the very nature of these traditions. For instance, Chitra Raman suggests that the claim that the Indian traditions give us so many ways to explore one’s experience and pursue perfect happiness makes them sound like “a recreational drug.” This reveals a misunderstanding of what happiness is. It conflates happiness with pleasure, while “happiness” refers to what lies beyond sukha-dukha. “Happiness” refers to Aristotle’s eudaimonia—the goal which all human beings seek to reach. Christianity has always claimed that such a perfect state cannot be attained on earth, because human beings are sinful. The only true happiness lies in the union of the soul with the biblical God after death, according to this religion. Therefore, all we can hope for on earth is pleasure (which in fact we ought to avoid, according to Christian asceticism). This conflation of happiness with pleasure trivializes the goal of the Indian traditions. It accepts a Christian assumption as a true fact about human beings. Next, this transformation inevitably leads to the distortion and degradation of the Indian traditions. One reduces the variety of action heuristics and insights into human existence to simple-minded doctrines like “pantheism,” “panentheism,” “integral humanism” or “Hindu secularism.” In effect, such doctrines transform the Indian traditions into primitive versions of Christianity and the western humanistic tradition. The western tradition developed complex theories about theism, humanism and secularism. These may be problematic, but they do reflect a massive intellectual project of a culture. The Indian traditions have not developed such elaborate theories, because they focused on kinds of knowledge other than theory: performative and experiential knowledge. In their turn, these kinds of knowledge are underdeveloped in the western traditions. When one turns the learning of the Indian traditions into doctrines instead of appreciating their unique forms of knowledge, one makes them into less developed variants of the philosophies of the western-Christian tradition. At the same time, this exercise brings in its wake the adoption of misunderstood and half-digested concepts from Christian theology and western philosophy. For instance, both “pantheism” and “panentheism” are concepts embedded in Christian theology. They refer to the belief that the biblical God (the theosin the theism) is immanent in the universe or that He is immanent but transcends the universe at the same time. Without the Christian theological framework, such concepts fail to make sense. Nevertheless, some Hindus proudly proclaim today that Hinduism has pantheism or panentheism. The same people take it that “Tat Tvam Asi” means that “your soul is wholly or partially the Ultimate Reality,” in the sense of “a mystical union with this Reality.” This is a half-baked version of the “salvation” of Christianity, a mystical union of the soul with God. The story about “the soul dissolving in Ultimate Reality” is popular among the New Age movement as a new doctrine, supposedly inspired by Hinduism. In reality, these are sentences that absorb the Indian traditions into the linguistic and conceptual framework of Christianity. As a part of this exercise, one sometimes tries to appropriate English words like “God,” “pantheism,” “soul,” etc. and give them a “Hindu” meaning. One tries to give one’s own meanings to words from the European languages, which have a theological meaning that goes back more than fifteen centuries. While doing so, one inherits the original theology. But at the same time, there is no clarity as to the new meaning and how the resulting concepts differ from the original Christian concepts. Needless to say, the result is a linguistic and conceptual jumble, which dissolves the Indian traditions into opacity.\nOnce one makes these traditions into a belief system, one also runs the risk of transforming them into a rigid set of doctrines. Like the Nicene Creed, one will now get a Hindu creed that is supposed to reflect the true teachings of Hinduism. This is happening under our eyes. Especially in the United States and the United Kingdom, attempts are undertaken to present a clear and common set of Hindu teachings. This seems necessary, because school-going children should be able to explain to their peers as to “what they believe in.” These texts also become the foundation for the representation of the Indian traditions in textbooks and encyclopaedias. Instead of realizing that these traditions are profoundly different from Christianity and Islam, one generates a set of doctrines that becomes the Hindu equivalent of the Christian and Islamic doctrines. In creating such Hindu creeds, one smuggles in a doctrinal intolerance into these traditions that is alien to them. Before there was rivalry in the sense that each of the Indian traditions advocated its own approach to the pursuit of happiness as the best and uniquely rewarding. Each tradition feels that it incorporates all others. Now, this degenerates into an aggressive defence of “the true teachings of Hinduism.” Those Indian traditions that refuse to accept these “true teachings” are turned into deviations from a normative mainstream. Basically, one begins to mimic the Christian orthodoxy and its stance towards “heresy.” Moreover, one attempts to create an ecumenical common ground of Hindu doctrine. This imitates the attempts of the Christian ecumenical movement to retrieve the true revelation of the biblical God by uniting all Christian churches and all human beings around a common creed. This may seem very humane and sweet from a Christian perspective. From the perspective of the Indian traditions, however, it is nothing but a degradation of differences into deviations from the mainstream: differences become obstacles to the common ground that we supposedly need to live together. Well, centuries of Indian history have demonstrated that a society does not need such a common ground among its different cultural, religious and traditional groups in order to create a relatively stable co-existence. For ages, Vaishnavas, Shaivas, Buddhists, Jainas, Christians, Muslims, etc. lived together without a common creed or legal framework. Naturally, there were conflicts and tensions in the Indian society, but it did not fall apart at any point. One of the fascinating questions about the Indian traditions is how they succeeded in doing this: what allowed them to live together without a common doctrinal or legal framework? The pursuit of an ecumenical common ground of Hinduism obliterates such questions and the answers that lie in the Indian traditions.\nBy creating a Hindu religion or belief system, one makes the swamijis into clerics. Instead of being guides on the different paths for the exploration of experience and the pursuit of happiness, the swamijis and gurujis now become priests, who have to expound Hindu doctrines. They are simply reduced to the representatives of a religion, who have to tell others about “the teachings of Hinduism.” A tendency then comes into being to create Hindu catechisms for the “benefit” of the Indian American youth. Mirroring the Protestant catechisms, the true Hindu teachings are presented in Q\u0026amp;A and FAQ forms. Thus, one takes away the creativity of thought of these traditions. All one can do is repeat the beliefs as though these are God’s own truth. While there is no denying that such efforts are of supreme import to Christianity, the Indian traditions have far more to offer. The experiential knowledge that has been developed by so many generations of wise men and women contains deep insights into human psychology and human cognition. Hence, the intellectual creativity of the Indian traditions is needed today more than ever. Another nefarious consequence is that one begins to imitate the European colonial masters in one’s attitude towards the average Indian and Indian American: one accuses them of ignorance of their own religion. One complains about the superficial understanding of the true teachings of Hinduism among so-called Hindus. One begins to lament “the cultural ignorance of many Indians,” instead of realizing that the ignorance is one’s own. This is identical to what the British colonials did in the nineteenth century. Operating under the assumption that each culture had its own religion, they started looking for the doctrines of the Indian religion in the Sanskrit texts. They invented and extracted a Hindu theology and religious law from these “sacred books of the East.” Next, they began to complain that neither the “Brahmin priests” nor the “Hindu laymen” knew their own religion: they were taken to be ignorant of the content of the texts, the true meaning of the doctrines and the legal and moral principles of Hinduism. Thus, the colonials never realized that they were describing their own experience. It was theywho could make sense of the Indian traditions only as a Hindu religion, a variant of Christianity. They were not describing the Indians’ experience, since the Indians had never seen or heard about this religion. To the Indian traditions, doctrines and moral rules were of no importance. Some texts had a role to play, but this role was nowhere similar to that of the Bible in Christianity. Today, the self-appointed representatives of Hinduism are continuing this colonial attitude: if the Indians don’t know about “the true teachings of Hinduism,” it is not because these doctrines do not exist in India, but because the Indians are ignorant of their own culture. One begins to be ashamed about the nature of certain aspects of the Indian traditions. That is, when the Indian traditions are absorbed into the Christian framework, their murtipujabecomes “idol-worship,” their devatas and devis become “manifestations of one Supreme God,” their sophisticated eroticism becomes “pornography,” their diversity becomes “confusion,” their recognition of all human emotions and behaviours becomes “depravity,” their beautifully crafted statues of naked devis become “seductive demons,” their diverse stories become “myths” or “scriptures.” Strikingly, even the suggestion that the Indian traditions are not a religion or belief system is then taken as an insult to these traditions, while in reality it reveals their riches. Adopting the western experience, one gets the feeling that the absence of fixed doctrines and rules in these traditions entails that they consist of “a slippery moral landscape.” One becomes embarrassed that the Indian traditions do not have an equivalent of the Ten Commandments and tries to construct such Hindu commandments. To conclude, all these consequences can be stated as one succinct hypothesis: those who conceptualize the Indian traditions as a Hindu religion or belief system are reproducing the western-Christian experience of the Indian traditions. In that experience, these traditions are reduced into pale and erring variants of biblical religion. In other words, they have accepted the experience of one culture (the West) as the framework for understanding and describing another culture (India). The colonial inferiority complex emerges, because one begins to see the Indian traditions as deficient versions of the Christian religion and the western belief system. The next step of such a cultural inferiority complex is an aggressive denial of this consequence and a fanatical claim that “Hinduism is superior to all other religions.” Saving the Swami from the Priest The call for new and alternative ways of studying the Indian traditions does not stem from the academic’s fear to become obsolete. It stems from a fear that we will lose a vast and beautiful contribution to humanity that has explored aspects of human existence largely ignored by Judaism, Christianity, Islam and their cultural progeny: human experience and perfect happiness. These are two things shared by all human beings: the inevitability of experience and the pursuit of happiness. As members of the human species, therefore, it is our duty not to let the wisdom of generations slip away like this. The rejuvenation of the Indian traditions will compel us to translate them into the language of the twenty-first century. It is not an attempt to revive the past, but to rediscover what these traditions already know. We need to show that their knowledge can compete with, and contribute to, the human sciences that emerged in the West. The world needs to realize that, thanks to these traditions, humanity has far more insights into human existence than has so far been assumed. This may well require reclaiming the Indian traditions—including Indian Islam and Indian Christianity—from their self-proclaimed secular critics as well asfrom their self-appointed religious representatives. It will most certainly require a genuinely scientific appreciation of the rich storehouse of knowledge produced by these traditions. It is only thus that we can show the true worth of the Indian traditions to humanity. This effort also requires participation and support from the Indian American communities. Not only should they prevent a facile anti-intellectualism from spreading in their ranks, they should instead stimulate their children to aspire becoming true intellectuals. We need engineers, medical doctors and other professionals. Perhaps we even need people whose lives revolve around the accumulation of material wealth. But more than any of these, we need a new generation of intellectuals: human scientists who will look at the Indian traditions through new eyes. This generation will show to humanity the contribution of these traditions. They will become the teachers of teachers. Now is the time to start taking steps towards the creation of such a generation of intellectuals. Practically, this will involve encouraging our children to join the humanities and social sciences. It will also require funding and an institutional framework: a think-tank or research institute needs to be set up for the study of the Indian traditions. But today the greatest need of all is new scientific research on these traditions and an open-mindedness towards the results of this research. [1] As Khyati Joshi shows in her stimulating book on the experiences of second-generation Indian Americans, the term “religious oppression” captures many of these experiences. See Khyati Joshi, New Roots in America’s Sacred Ground: Religion, Race and Ethnicity in Indian America (New Brunswick, N.J.: Rutgers University Press, 2005). [2] Our research group at Ghent University, Belgium and Kuvempu University, India is perhaps the only academic group to engage in a joint effort to uphold the Indian traditions against the defamation they have been subjected to during the last four or five centuries. Those interested can look into some of our publications : S.

In this talk, I would like to focus on the two attitudes that I have towards your project. It is not that I have ambiguous feelings; no, I have two distinct feelings. On the one hand, I am convinced that you will not reach your goal because such a goal is unreachable. Not only that. Your goal is undesirable and best abandoned. On the other hand, if you strive with integrity, clarity and passion to reach your goal, in the process, you will achieve results that are desirable, necessary and important. So, I would like to support and encourage your project. On the one hand, I believe that I can develop a few impossibility arguments that will show why you best abandon your project; on the other hand, I have given no thought to developing such a set of arguments because I want you to work further towards your goal so that you produce the results that we, as humankind, need. This might suggest that I am ambiguous toward your project, but, as I said, I am not. To explain thus attitude better, let me use an illustration from the history of philosophy (albeit in a slightly caricatured form),\n2. Much like the thinker we all admire, the late Leo Apostel, I too am a child of Logical Positivism in general and of Vienna circle in particular. However, I am no logical positivist in any sense of the term. Yet, I am deeply grateful to what this group of philosophers did to philosophy; without their extraordinary contributions, our intellectual world would have been very poor indeed. Even today, reading Carnap’s The Logical Structure of the World is thrilling and exciting. To read the manifesto of the Vienna Circle, about the Scientific World View, is to be transported back in time to a magical and wonderful world. However, we now know that the programme of Logical Positivism, in the form that made it exciting, is an unreachable goal. The logical positivists are the first and only group of people I know who showed that their research programme could not be carried out, while seriously trying to execute it. However, in this process, they gave us results and insights that even now we are trying to digest fully: the impossibility theorem of Gödel, Goodman’s paradoxes of induction or even the insights of critics like Popper, Quine, Kuhn and so on. I am extremely glad that I am a child of Logical Positivism because, in trying to reach a goal, they have not only taught us that their goal is unreachable but also, more importantly, why that is the case.\nIn some senses, Apostel’s dream and project is like the programme of Logical Positivism: It is unreachable, undesirable and unwanted. Yet, it should be pursued because, in the process, we are going to learn things we would not learn otherwise. In this talk, I will try to exhibit both attitudes: I will try to show why I disagree with your project while, at the same time, formulating some questions, which I hope you will be motivated to answer. One caveat though: as you can suspect, my objections arise from the research project that I have been working on for the last three decades, a project that Apostel found “deep and exciting”. Consequently, my problems have many dimensions. However, given that I do not have much time to explain and elaborate these dimensions, I will focus on just one thread and one dimension. Even here, I will have to be very brief and short. My apologies for that. At the same time, I hope what I say will encourage both of us to have many more meetings in the future so that we may pursue what appeals to all of us unconditionally: the search for truth.\n3. Let me begin with aspects of an article that Clement so kindly sent me: it is published in the journal MetaPhilosophy. I will not be doing justice to this rich and thought-provoking article because it should be discussed sentence by sentence during an entire semester and not randomly touched upon the way I am going to do. Again, my apologies. Blame it on Clement: he should not have sent it to me just before this talk. But also blame me: I should not have read it either, but I did.\n3.1 In the first place, Clement speaks about both multiple and a multiplicity of world views: not only are there, as he puts it, scientific, religious, and philosophical world views (these are the multiple world views) but also a multiplicity of each of these world views. When you put it this way, you run the risk of trivializing the very notion of world view itself. Indeed, it is a trivial exercise to transform even the five ‘profound questions’ of the philosophical agenda (that Apostel asks) in such a way that they become questions of every partial description of the world. That is, the distinction between theories and world views can be quickly effaced, if one allows for this kind of multiplicity.\n3.2 The second is the bold (but false) claim about the status of these five questions. These are neither profound questions of philosophy nor are they perennial. These are not questions of philosophy, i.e., they cannot even be formulated outside of accepting some or another philosophical theory but they are questions in philosophy i.e.,they are not theory-neutral. You cannot ask questions about ‘what is?‘ unless you make philosophical assumptions about what ‘existence’ is, whether it is a property of an object or something else entirely. For instance, the question ‘what is?’ has a nonsensical linguistic form in Indian languages and in Chinese. You cannot even formulate the question ‘what is existence?’ in Asian languages. So, if this is to be seen as a profound and perennial philosophical question, either you have to disallow that Asian culture has philosophy or tone down this formulation. However, if you tone the question down by saying that only ‘some philosophies’ ask this question, your project is hardly exciting.\nSimilar considerations apply to the so-called ethical question: ‘The normative dimension (2) tackles “ought-questions,” typified by the fourth worldview question, \u0026ldquo;What is good and what is evil?”’ (P. 310) When you identify the normative dimension and the ought-question with perennial questions of philosophy, you not only shut out Asian (and, presumably African) thinkers out but also the Ancient Greeks: surely, you cannot seriously mean that Aristotle’s Ethica Nicomochea is ‘normative’ and answers ‘ought-questions’, are you? What is your evidence for the claim that the Asian culture even has ‘normative’ language (i.e., that its natural languages have ‘normative‘ vocabularies)? From whence the belief that both Greeks and Asians find the division ‘Good’ and ‘Evil’ even intelligible, the way they are that in the Semitic (and Zoroastrian) religions?\n3.3 Consider how Clement elaborates on this normative question and splits it from what he calls the practical question: “ “How to live a good life?” and “How to organize a good society?” Here again, the questions are mixed. For example, the question of how to live a good life is mixed with the psychology of well-being; the question of how to organize a good society is mixed with political philosophy, sociology, and so on.” Two things: ‘how to live a good life’ is supposed to be a mixed question because it is also mixed with a theory about the ‘psychology of well-being’. And, quite obviously, a theoretical answer about a ‘good society’ is required before we build such a society. The implications of such a stance becomes obvious when we look at the so-called practical question, which is everything but ‘practical’: “The practical dimension (3) addresses “act-questions.” Given our model of the world and our axiology, how can we act? it is the domain of praxeology (worldview question (e)) and is mixed with fields like operational research, problem-solving methods, management sciences, and so forth.” (both citations on page 310).\nClearly, the act-questions are dependent upon our model of the world and our theories in axiology. That is to say, our actions-in-the-world are non-trivially dependent on our theories about the world. This huge assumption about the relation between theory and human practice, however, is neither universal nor profound. On top of it, it is empirically false. This idea about human beings that undergirds these perennial questions that Clement elaborates is not theory-neutral either. In that case, two extra problems emerge: (a) the world views themselves are parasitic on unargued (and, perhaps, false) assumptions; (b) the number of world-views explode arithmetically, if not geometrically.\n3.4 At least one reason for these problems is to be located in what these world-views (as entities) are supposed to be. On the one hand, Clement says that “Apostel’s definition of a worldview is \u0026hellip; broader than just a representation of the world”. Yet, on the other hand, the citation he provides undercuts it: the world view is seen as “a coherent collection of concepts” allowing us to construct a global image of the world, and in this way to understand as many elements of our experience as possible” (ibid., emphasis added). The citation speaks of a ‘global image of the world’, where the word ‘global’ can only mean ‘total’. Surely, an ‘image’ of the world is a representation; further, if it is to be ‘total’, it can be that only if it is a ‘faithful’ representation of the world. Further, because it is a collection of concepts that is ‘coherent’ (‘coherence’, after all, is a semantic property), it can only be some kind of a theory. In that sense, a world view cannot be broader than a ‘representation of the world’. A world view, according to this definition, cannot be anything else.\nConsider now other unargued assumptions that sneak in: the world view helps us understand as many ‘elements of experience’ as possible. The first is that ‘ununderstood’ experience is possible. The second is that experience contains ‘elements’. If ‘experience’ contains ‘elements’, can we ever ‘experience’ these elements? Or, does it mean that some ’elements’ of experience can neither be experienced nor thought of (because there can be ‘ununderstood’ elements of experience)? In that case, how can we know they ‘exist’ at all, if they are inaccessible to both ‘reason’ and ‘experience’? Furthermore, is experience purely ‘individual’ or is such a thing impossible? What does ’experience’ mean when one says all of us have ‘experience about how to act in the world’ (p.313)? Experience about ‘how to act’? I have no idea what it means to say this.\n3.5 There is a reason to ask these questions because these are the kinds of questions that Indian thinkers have asked for millennia. To do this, they assumed the opposite relationship between theory and practice to the one Apostel and Clement share, an opposite idea about human beings to what western (Christian) philosophies claim, an opposite idea of human knowledge to those that our social sciences and philosophies exhibit. So, your grand project faces this problem: to whom are you building your world view?\nThere is an easy answer, which is actually as good an example of an unfounded assumption as any other. Clement claims: “Every one of us is in need of a worldview, whether it is implicit or explicit.” (P.313) Even if we assume that we can identify (or ‘detect’) the presence of an explicit world view, how could we detect its implicit presence? Unless one assumes that some explicit ‘symptoms’ can only be caused by world views (and by nothing else), presence of some phenomena (in an explicit fashion) cannot be an evidence for the presence of world views. It cannot be a hypothesis for the simple reason that no one has any idea of what the effects of the world view are and we have no way of testing for the presence or absence of implicit ‘world views’. So, this can only be a definitional move. Surely, the presence or absence of world views among human beings is an empirical and theoretical problem. This cannot be solved but only dissolved by a definition. A research programme that survives only because of a stipulative definition is cognitively uninteresting and trivial.\n4. Let me summarize one of my attitudes in a simple form now. I cannot buy into your research project because it is parochial in nature. It is ‘parochial’, not in a pejorative sense but in the sense that it is tied to ‘parishes’: this programme is an attempt at the secularization of a religion, in the specific sense that it tries to transform theological ideas into the topoi of a culture. It is uninteresting because it attempts to repeat once again what Europe has done in the last five centuries: present its intellectual topoi as the universal and even scientific framework to understand humanity. European attempts have succeeded until now: I believe that epoch is definitively over at the turn of the twenty-first century. I do not believe it has a future.\n5. Having made these rather harsh-sounding judgements, let me turn my attention to explicating my second attitude where I wish you would succeed, where I am your friend and supporter. To do this, I need to give you a very caricatured description of one of the strands of my research programme. However, let us not be detained by caricatures: I have caricatured your project; so it only stands to reason that I caricature mine as well. It is also necessary because we can only begin a conversation today. Many, many such conversations are required before we understand each other and I look forward to having them in the future. For now, let us grope towards outlining at least one reference point, which is where caricatures come in handy.\n6. Here is one thin-description of an element of the European intellectual history. As you know, the Greeks drew a distinction between ‘dialectic’ and ‘rhetoric’. The former, though it had to do with debates, was more concerned with the forms of reasoning used in debates. Though the appreciation of ‘rhetoric’ varied\u0026mdash;think about what Plato thought while comparing it to what Aristotle did\u0026mdash;it was clear that it was about forms of persuasion. In so far as we are talking about forms of reasoning, it is clear that ‘dialectic’ is about logic (as we understand the subject today). What about rhetoric? Today, looking back at its rich history, we can say it is about argumentation: it involves informal logic basically; it is about the nature of arguments we use to persuade people. In other words, the western culture (among other things, of course) has focused on logic and persuasion, when doing ‘philosophy’. In doing philosophy, the intellectuals strove to develop ‘theories’: initially (actually, for a very long period of time) the idea was that a good theory began with true premises, had a correct starting point (till the twentieth century, philosophers were very bothered with the question ‘with what must a philosophy begin?’), and was developed in a logically sound way. Thus, we have a triad: dialectic, rhetoric and theory, terms which are still with us in their rich and varied inter-connections, even if they take the form of logics, argumentations, and theories today.\n6.1 The Greek notion of theory found an unexpected home with the emergence and growth of Christianity in the interstices of the Ancient culture: it went to the heart of that religion. Theology grew as a theory, functioning within the limits set by logic and following its rules, obeying (even if only dimly) the strictures of rhetoric, This move was compatible with the Christian religion because of the role it accorded to reason: to the Divine Reason to begin with, which was at the foundation of the world but, which, over a period of time extended to human reason as well: Christianity also became a religion of reason or a ‘reasonable religion’. This movement, which gave only Reason the foundational role, is the movement that I call the ‘rationality’ dimension in the western culture. In exactly the same way Reason lies at the foundation of the Cosmos (the ‘laws of the Universe’, so to speak), it also is the foundation of everything else: society, ethics, human practice etc. These moments too are still with us: we need a theory of ‘good society’ to build a good society, a theory of ethics to be ethical, a theory about family to be a good parent and set up a good family etc; human practices are rational or irrational as they embody choices that are either rational or irrational; and so on. Consequently, there is only one kind of knowledge, namely, the ‘theoretical knowledge’ and even the word ‘science’, until very, very recently, referred only to scientific ‘theories’. There is lots more to be said about this dimension, the dimension of ‘rationality’, than what I have. But it is sufficient to give a circumscription to this project of ‘rationality’: it attempts to seek foundations of phenomena in reason, whether human, cosmic or divine. Human practice, especially, is seen to be founded in reason.\n6.2 Contrasted to this dimension of ‘rationality’ stands the dimension of ‘reasonableness’. This can also be given some kind of rough circumscription: the project of being reasonable involves an attempt to reflect on human experience in order to improve human practice. Human practice itself is (as I consider it) knowledge, practical knowledge and the role of human reason is to reflect about it and improve it. There is also another dimension to the project of reasonableness: it consists of an attempt to make one’s common-sense ideas and beliefs (as many as possible) compatible with the best theories we have in the sciences today. Because of these two dimensions, the emphasis here falls on forms of thinking and not either on forms of reasoning or on forms of persuasion. The practice and project of reasonableness encourage and develop the ability to think. Think in order to do what though?\n6.3 We can now contrast both theoretical and practical knowledge in terms of what they do: while theoretical knowledge solves problems, practical knowledge dissolves them. Consider, for example, the following ‘problems’: the Palestinian problem, the environmental problem, the problem of injustices in society and individual psychological problems. Should we solve them or dissolve them? Should we solve the Palestinian problem or dissolve it, i.e., make it disappear? Should we solve the environmental problem or should we dissolve it, i.e., make it non-existent? Should we solve the problem of injustice in society or should we dissolve it, i.e. remove injustices from our societies? Finally, should we solve psychological problems of individuals or dissolve them?\nWe can appreciate that these questions cannot be asked when we look at natural sciences: should we dissolve the problem of Fermat’s last theorem or solve it? Should we solve the so-called paradoxes of Quantum physics or dissolve them? Should we solve the problem of consistency of elementary set theory or dissolve it? What dissolves problems in scientific theories are definitions, while theories solve problems. Thus, if we dissolve problems in our scientific theories, we will have no sciences to speak of; whereas if we dissolve problems of human practices, we can hope for a relatively peaceful coexistence. This merely suggests that the distinction makes sense, and no more than that.\n6.4 This distinction can be made further sense of, if we look at cultures as ways of meeting the challenge of survival. Consider the two possible ways of meeting such a challenge. To survive in an environment, one can focus on knowing what there is in the environment and attempt to respond adequately on that basis. The other way is to develop a fluid and flexible set of learning processes that can adapt itself to multiple environments based on feedback from the environment. In the first case, there is an emphasis on developing theoretical knowledge and in the other on developing practical knowledge. In my story, these distinguish cultures from one another. However, both kinds of knowledge exist in all cultures, even if only one is developed explicitly.\n6.5 The project of rationality that I spoke of indexes the development of theoretical rationality. The project of reasonableness focused on the development of practical knowledge. In the first case, the attempt is to found everything (social and personal changes and development) on the foundations of reason. However, doing this involves violence: practical knowledge, which neither needs nor requires foundation in reason is forced to accommodate itself to the demands of reason. The Protestant reformation, the multiple social revolutions in Europe, etc are examples of attempts to found human practice on reason. Today, this movement is being carried further and we see its perverse effects even on institutions of learning. By claiming that our modern society is scientific and technological society, one suggests that science and technology constitute the foundation of modern society. The task of universities then is seen as one of producing ‘knowledge workers’. Every day, we are experiencing the pernicious and perverse effects of this way of thinking about our universities. Such attempts not only inflict violence, but they also fail. One kind of knowledge cannot be the foundation for other kinds of knowledge.\n7. The world view project is to be situated in this project of rationality: the attempt to found everything on theories. However, violence of the kind I spoke of in only one side of the coin. The other side of the coin is this: it is only the rationality project that lays bare the limits of human reason and identifies possible solutions as well. Most, if not all, interesting insights into human reason have come from the project of rationality. Whether we talk about it in terms of impossibility theorems (whether of Gödel or Arrow or Sen), or in terms of paradoxes of rationality, they are the signal achievements of the project of rationality. Sciences, in my view, express the project of reasonableness even if the scientists believe in the project of rationality. That is to say, a meta-project of rationality guides the object-level reasonableness project. I am not sure whether there is a necessary link between the object and meta-level; I am inclined to answer partially in the positive.\n8. Be it as that may, it must now be clear that the project of rationality, much like logical positivism of yesteryears, is desirable on cognitive grounds. The violence that I speak of emerges from the drive to found everything on one kind of knowledge, theoretical knowledge. However, it is in the nature of knowledge that makes it impossible to draw the limits: ignorance does not and cannot limit knowledge. Perhaps, and that is my hope, one kind of knowledge can attempt to draw the limits of another kind of knowledge. That is, that practical knowledge can draw the limits of theoretical knowledge. To do this, however, we need to partially transform practical knowledge itself: provide it with theoretical articulation, which is what my research programme is about.\n9. Now, you can see why I desire that you pursue your project. Much like logical positivism, your failure will teach us more than your success. The more completely you fail in reaching your goal, the more valuable your results will be. You will be entirely successful in your project, if you fail radically in achieving your goal. You will succeed only in your failure and, for that reason, I would like to support you in your venture. I am your friend and supporter because I want that you pursue your goal with integrity, determination and fervor. Your results will be extremely valuable and those results cannot be arrived at in any other fashion than by pursuing your goal. But I cannot participate in your project because I represent the pole of reasonableness and not that of rationality. It is irrational to encourage you to pursue a doomed and impossible project but it is a very reasonable stance: we will all learn important things through your failure. So, I would like to wish you bon chance: good luck with your endeavor. I look forward to your results.\nThank you.

Last Wednesday he lost his battle with cancer. The influence of this Palestinian writer in all areas of the social sciences of the last quarter century is immense. Many will remember him from Delhi to Dar Es Salaam, from Paris to Chicago; many will also write in memoriams.\nAs the author of a whole series of books and articles, it was mainly Orientalism, a book published in 1978, which garnered fame and criticism and brought him friends and enemies alike. How will we remember him? As someone who influenced the intellectual world for what it meant for a period and its achievements? Or will we remember him as he should be remembered, because of his challenges to us? What makes Edward Said an interesting and perhaps a tragic figure is that the answers to these two questions do not coincide.\nEdward Said was a professor of English Literature, but what he wrote has contributed greatly to the political correctness of our time. The moral precepts that dictate how to speak and act correctly often determine what we think about: these precepts become the thought police of a generation. What do I mean?\nA few weeks ago, in the TV program Nachtwacht, the following pearls of wisdom could be heard: \u0026ldquo;Islam does not exist, but there are many Islams\u0026rdquo;; \u0026ldquo;it is \u0026rsquo;essentialist\u0026rsquo; to speak of Islam,\u0026rdquo; and so on. This was also Edward Said\u0026rsquo;s diagnosis in his Orientalism, which shed light on Western views of the Orient. In examining how the West has described Islam and the people of the Middle East, Said sought to argue that there is a tendency in Western culture to freeze Islam in a fundamental set of doctrines that remain unchanging through time.\nThe television program echoed similar thoughts when it was said that one should not \u0026ldquo;essentialize\u0026rdquo; and that Islam does not exist. But what is wrong with \u0026ldquo;essentialism\u0026rdquo;? How many kinds of \u0026ldquo;essentialism\u0026rdquo; exist? What is wrong with saying that water is \u0026ldquo;essentially\u0026rdquo; H2O and that liquids are not water if their chemical composition does not have the \u0026ldquo;essential\u0026rdquo; property of H2O? If Islam does not exist, how is it possible to talk about different Islams? What makes a particular religion one of the Islam, not one of the Christianities?\nOr take another example. What exists on earth is a John, Peter, Paul, and so on. Can we say on these grounds that man does not exist, but that there are only individual human beings? If man doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist, what did Darwin do when he studied the origin of the species? There is currently a heated debate in the philosophy of biology about the units of selection: does selection take place at the level of the individual organism, or at the level of the group, or at the level of the genes? This debate will not be settled on the basis of political correctness. Why would it be different for Islam?\nAnother example is Said\u0026rsquo;s statement about \u0026ldquo;dichotomies.\u0026rdquo; He claims that much of the violence between people has to do with the distinction between \u0026ldquo;we\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;them\u0026rdquo;: between Europeans and Arabs, between East and West, and so on. This statement, which at first glance seems plausible, is part of the same political correctness. But what\u0026rsquo;s wrong with dichotomies or binary thinking? Our electrical connections are binary: they are either on or off; computers are in a binary state: 0 or 1; we evaluate statements in binary terms: true or false. What is wrong with this? Dichotomies are believed to indicate dualism in thought, which in turn is believed to be evil. But those who say this have not said what the alternative should be: monism, or something else? Is the trichotomy better than the dichotomy?\nTo get closer to home, consider many debates about migrants in Belgium. It is often said that there is only a Mohammed, an Ibrahim and an Abdullah, but no \u0026ldquo;migrant.\u0026rdquo; It must therefore be assumed that the legislative and judicial bodies of the Belgian state lose themselves in delusion when they formulate or interpret laws about migrants. Every time I cross the border with my Belgian passport, there is a miracle: since the Belgian does not exist, how can I cross the border because I am a Belgian?\nSpeaking about the migrant culture is viewing culture as a static and not a dynamic entity, the same people tell us. So should we accept that all scientists speak in static terms when they talk about the development of the child\u0026rsquo;s body during adolescence?\nI can give an endless series of examples of similar silliness, but that\u0026rsquo;s not for now. Today it is important to realize that Edward Said has been instrumental in creating this generation of illiterate intellectuals. They are the opinion leaders. They are our thought police. They are numerous and their impact catastrophic. Many of them are professors at universities large and small, transforming our children into ignorant empty heads. This is Said\u0026rsquo;s contribution to his time. This is also the tragedy surrounding Said. Perhaps the believers among you will wish peace to his soul after all. As a heathen who has no knowledge of what a soul is or where it finds peace, I tend to think less generously about the death of this Edward Said.\nBut there is also another Edward Said, the Said I teach my students. This man turned our attention to a phenomenon that was hardly at issue before he exposed it. He made us aware of the fact that Western culture speaks in a very systematic and very specific way about other (non-Western) cultures. And that this phenomenon has a long history. This way of looking at other cultures should not be seen as an expression of racism, sexism, xenophobia or imperialism, it is a phenomenon of a different order.\nAlthough racists and xenophobes have also often been orientalists (those who study the orient), not all orientalists are racists and xenophobes. Instead, one must identify the mechanisms by which Western culture has transformed all other cultures into variants of itself.\nThis Edward Said did uncover a phenomenon, but he couldn\u0026rsquo;t explain it. He gave an immense task to the future generations of intellectuals and social scientists: how can we explain that a certain culture is characterized by a characteristic way of speaking about other cultures despite historical changes, discontinuities, and revolutions? How can we determine whether the violent clash between Western culture and other cultures has anything to do with the way the West has distinguished itself from those other cultures? Are there other ways to distinguish cultures (after all, there are different cultures) that do not lead to violence, discrimination and domination?\nIn other words, this Edward Said emphasized the need to develop scientific knowledge that would also be deeply humanistic. The latter was important to him because he was a humanist. Nothing human was alien to him. Although he was neither a philosopher nor a social scientist, he brought to the fore issues that are fundamental to both philosophy and the social sciences. He delineated the task of at least two generations; he gave us some fascinating insights.\nAn example of this is his description of Orientalism. It should not be seen so much as a series of doctrines or dogmas, said Said, but rather as a limitation on human thinking. All human thinking is limited by culture, time, accumulated knowledge and by language. In other words, thinking is limited because it is human. But not all human thinking is orientalistic. Orientalism is a product of Western thinking. Western thinking is of course also human. But it goes without saying that not all thinking is Western. From that perspective, Orientalism is a specific kind of limitation on Western thinking: it is a cultural project. That insight allows us to investigate the relationship between Western culture and its thinking. It also allows us to conceptualize cultural differences in a non-oriental way.\nThis Said also died. This is the Said we should remember. An intellectual of the caliber of Said may be best remembered not for what he meant for a period, but for what he should have meant. If we do that, we can be sure that the future will remember it as it should: as an intellectual who was among the first to turn our attention to a phenomenon of exceptional scope. This Said will not die. We don\u0026rsquo;t have to sing any requiems for this Said.\n","tags":[],"title":"Long Live Edward Said?","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/long-live-edward-said/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","basics","stories","symbolism","explication"],"content":"There are multiple kinds of interpretation.

In logic, we speak of \u0026ldquo;interpretation of variables\u0026rdquo; like p, q, etc. Here, it means that the letters stand-in for arbitrary sentences with truth-values.\nThen, we have linguistic interpretation: here, it has to do with meaning. One of the best developed ideas is that \u0026lsquo;meaning\u0026rsquo; of a sentence requires mapping them to a domain of objects. The conditions under which a sentence is true gives us the meaning of the sentence, say some, where \u0026rsquo;truth\u0026rsquo; involves mapping. This notion of interpretation, where understanding requires linguistic interpretation, which gives us the meaning of the sentence. In Samskara, UR is talking about the linguistic interpretation of the erotic passages. And the question is directed at the admonition by the Acharya (as I remember it).\nQuite separate from this is the multiple notion(s) of \u0026ldquo;symbolic interpretation\u0026rdquo;: one sees as a \u0026ldquo;symbol\u0026rdquo; whatever one feels like. They could be stories, actions, texts, advertisements, dance, meditation, voting, religion, culture\u0026hellip; For instance, Courtright believes he is giving a \u0026ldquo;Freudian interpretation\u0026rdquo; of the story of Ganesha which means that he is mapping the story of Ganesha to a particular linguistic interpretation of the texts of Freud. Kripal, for instance, \u0026ldquo;interprets\u0026rdquo; the sucking of the toes (by the Tantriks) as a symbol for oral sex. The author you cited is interpreting the word \u0026ldquo;apsaras\u0026rdquo; as \u0026ldquo;phenomenon of the mind\u0026rdquo; and is thus interpreting these creatures \u0026ldquo;symbolically\u0026rdquo;. And so on.\nMy discussion about \u0026ldquo;interpretation\u0026rdquo; pertains to the last kind: that is, it is about \u0026ldquo;symbolic interpretation\u0026rdquo;.\n","tags":[],"title":"Interpretations","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/interpretations/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","History","stories"],"content":"The western intellectual tradition has bemoaned the fact that the Indians never indulged in history-writing (or historiography). In this tradition, there is an obsessive need for collecting \u0026ldquo;facts\u0026rdquo; about the past. This is partly the result of how Judaism, Christianity and Islam (the three Semitic religions) look at themselves and their own past: everything they claim about their past (the Flood, the temple of Solomon, the coming of Christ, etc.) should not only be true but proven so beyond all doubt. They have to be true (in the sense that their recounting of the past should also be confirmed by research) because these religions live or die accordingly as whether it is also true what they say effectively happened on earth. These facts (like the existence of, say, the Temple of Solomon in the Israel of today and the Judea of yesterday or the existence of Jesus of Nazareth), in their turn, prove the truth about Moses and his tablet and the truth of the promise of God to the children of Israel. If the recounting of their past turns out to be false (like, say, the absence of any of the above two) would destroy their existence: if there was never a historical Jesus of Nazareth, Christianity would collapse like a house of cards. (In fact, Julian the Apostate, the nephew of the Emperor Constantine, set out to rebuild the Temple of Solomon at its original site precisely in order to do this. His early death, viewed both by the Jews and the Christians as an act of God, put an end to this project.)\nIn the Ancient Greek culture, they encountered two things: both historiography (Thucydides, for instance) and an abundance of stories about the Greek past. The Greeks called these stories as \u0026ldquo;muthos \u0026quot; (the English \u0026ldquo;myths\u0026rdquo; comes from this Greek word) and their culture had an ambiguous relationship to these stories. To the Jews and the Christians, quite obviously, these myths could not be \u0026ldquo;true\u0026rdquo; claims about the past of the Greeks. \u0026ldquo;Quite obviously\u0026rdquo; because these Semitic religions possessed \u0026ldquo;the true\u0026rdquo; account of the human past. Consequently, \u0026ldquo;myths\u0026rdquo; could not be true. By the end of the sixteenth century, a very firm framework had been set to interpret myths. They were obviously false. If not true, why did the Greeks compose myths and what did they \u0026ldquo;really\u0026rdquo; want to say? Multiple answers were provided: one of them was that they were \u0026ldquo;disguised\u0026rdquo; historiography. The poetic imagination transformed historical facts into exaggerated myths. So, one needed to \u0026ldquo;interpret\u0026rdquo; these myths to find out what the historical facts were and discard the rest as \u0026ldquo;poetic exaggeration\u0026rdquo;.\nBy the time Europe encountered India, this was the framework for looking at myths. Most of the multiple theories of myth we have today make the same point: myths require interpretation because poetic imagination has transformed facts into myths (falsehoods). These facts could be moral in nature (myths are allegories of moral virtues), historical in nature (myths are disguised historiography) or whatever else that takes one\u0026rsquo;s fancy. Whatever the theory, the consensus is unanimous: historiography is the only way of dealing with the past and cultures that did not know of history-writing take to producing myths.\nMost of us in India have accepted the Semitic framework. Some have taken the direct Semitic route of wanting to say that our myths are history: the Hindutva movement exemplifies this trend. They want to show that Ayodya existed on earth, there is a \u0026ldquo;rama sethu\u0026rdquo; and so on and so forth. In the process, they are doing what Christianity wants to do: destroy the Indian traditions and culture. If left unattended, the Hindutva movement is going to kill our traditions, irreparably and irrevocably. The others have taken the indirect Semitic route: look at myths as falsehoods and seek their symbolic interpretations. These attempts are no better.\nFor more, check these articles:\nWhat do Indians need: history or past?\nItihasa vs. History\n","tags":[],"title":"Historiography and Myths","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/historiography-and-myths/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","enlightenment","ignorance","real"],"content":"Two caveats. One: the commentary is very, very short. To write down all the things I want to say about this citation requires a long paper and not a brief mail. Two: I have not checked either the citation or the reference (Brihadaranyaka upanishad - I.iv.10). I assume that both are accurate.\nThis (Self) was indeed Brahman in the beginning. It knew itself only as \u0026ldquo;I am Brahman.\u0026rdquo; Therefore it became all.\nPerhaps, the major stumbling block to understanding this sentence is the word ‘Brahman’. To know that one is ‘Brahman’, one needs to know what the word refers to and what it means. Such knowledge requires a brain (in so far as organic creatures like ourselves are concerned); such a brain should be housed in a body; that body should be within two environments (the Natural and the Social); one of these environments must have taught that body a language (‘Brahman’ is a word in Sanskrit, a natural language) and so on. If all these considerations are taken together, the above three sentence are patently false: such an event could not have occurred in ‘the’ beginning at all. This would be the result of protracted processes, both natural and social, which our Sciences are still studying. Is this Upanishad selling manifest falsehoods as ‘the’ truth?\nOne could understand these sentences better, if we say: ‘I am I’ and suggest that this is what ‘Self-Consciousness’ is. Self-consciousness means nothing more or less than the ‘I am I’ awareness, the way ‘bachelor’ means nothing more or less than ‘an unmarried person’. This self-consciousness is an emergent property of a sufficiently complex system. This self-awareness (or self-consciousness) is not itself either a material or an energetic entity. Thus, the only pre-requisite is the coming-into-existence of a complex system.\nThere is nothing else that accompanies this emergent ‘I’. This ‘I’, being neither material nor energetic, does not ‘exist’. ‘Therefore’, this is the logical implication that the Upanishad draws, this ‘I’ is ‘all’ or becomes ‘all’. Nothing else is logically possible or permitted.\nAnd whoever among the gods had this enlightenment also became That (Brahman). It is the same with the seers (rishis), the same with men. The seer Vamadeva, having realized This (self) as That, came to know: \u0026ldquo;I was Manu and the Sun.\u0026rdquo;\nhas this ‘enlightenment’ (that is, realizes that the ‘I is I’) becomes the ‘I’. This is true for any creature, whether seers or men. “The ‘I’ is ‘that’”, as Vamadeva realizes.) ‘That’ is a demonstrative pronoun. To the question, ‘Who is the I’? there is one adequate answer: point the ‘I’ out. (‘That’, which you point out, is the ‘I’.) What do you point out? ‘That’, which is the ‘I’. Obvious: you can only point out an elephant when one asks ‘what is the elephant’. You say, ‘that’ (is an elephant) by pointing out the elephant. That seer further knows that the ‘I’ WAS “the Manu and the Sun”, in the sense that it ‘is’ (i.e. that it is an emergence) because of what happened ‘before’, i.e. the coming-into-existence of a sufficiently complex system.\nAnd to this day, whoever in a like manner knows the Self as \u0026ldquo;I am Brahman\u0026rdquo;, becomes all this (universe).\nNecessarily, this situation does not change over time. Thus, whoever accesses this ‘I am I’ awareness becomes ‘all this’ or ‘nothing’ (the ‘Shunyata’ of the Buddha). Both are meaningful because ‘all this’ cannot be individuated for the simple reason that it is neither matter nor energy. It does not even EXIST as a unique, one-of- a-kind entity IN this universe. Thus, you can say ‘all this Universe’ or ‘nothing’.\nEven the gods cannot prevent his becoming this, for he has become their Self.\nNothing that occurs in this universe can prevent such an access to the ‘I’ because the Real is not subject to any causal processes, which occur only in the realm of existence. The intervention of the gods occurs in this universe and is subject to causal processes, even if we cannot say what these causal processes are. Further, we always have partial access to the ‘I’ in the sense that from the minute we are born the ‘I’ is based on the complex organism you also are. The ‘I’, in one sense, emerges from the kind of being you are. In another sense, because the ‘I’ cannot be individuated at all, the ‘I’ that emerges from your birth is IDENTICAL to the ‘I’ that is an emergent property of other complex systems. Thus, this ‘I’ is not ‘born’ with your birth; nor can it disappear after your ‘death’. It knows neither birth nor death because it does not exist in this universe. Thus, this constant (partial) access and its nature as the Real renders the gods incapable of intervening.\nNow, if a man worships another deity, thinking: \u0026ldquo;He is one and I am another\u0026rdquo;, he does not know.\nWhat does he not know? That the ‘I’ does not exist and, therefore, cannot be individuated. That it is logically impossible to distinguish one ‘I’ from the other ‘I’ because there is only one ‘I’. We cannot even say that there is ‘one’ I and not ‘two’ because we are not talking about some unique, one-of-a-kind entity. This ‘I’ or ‘that’ of Vamadeva does not exist. Period. Hence, ‘Advaita’, which means not ‘two’. It is not ‘monism’ as the European savants (and their Indian acolytes) think. It is ‘not two’, which does not mean that it is one or one billion. Self-consciousness cannot be distinguished. One who thinks that it is possible, ‘does not know’.\nHe is like an animal to the gods. As many animals serve a man, so does each man serve the gods. Even if one animal is taken away, it causes anguish (to the owner); how much more so when many (are taken away)! Therefore it is not pleasing to the gods that men should know this.\nSelf-clarifying in terms of what is said so far.\nWe also notice that the Upanishad is also struggling to say what it wants to say. The only way we can talk about the real is by using the language of existence. Our natural languages and our scientific languages try to describe what exists in this Cosmos, using appropriate languages that are meant to describe existence. To use such a language to talk about the real creates huge difficulties, which every Indian tradition has faced. This Upanishad is no exception to this rule.\nII\nAgain, on an entirely different note and in a partially different style, a very short reflection on what I wrote about the Upanishadic citation.\nIf the ‘I’ cannot be individuated or described, then there is no possible distinction between the ‘I’ and ‘the Brahman’. They are different names for ‘self-awareness’ which pick out the differential access that individuals have to ‘self-awareness’. Hence, the curious distinction that some Indian traditions make. On the one hand, the ‘I’ is alleged to be identical with the ‘Brahman’, on the other, the same traditions distinguish between ‘Atmagyaana’ and ‘Brahmagyaana’. These two ‘gyanaas’ can be two types of knowledge, if, on one reading, they are knowledge about two different objects, namely ‘atman’ and ‘Brahman’. If, however, they are identical, there could be only one knowledge. Second, even that is not possible. We can only have knowledge of something, if that something exists. If Atman or Brahman exist in this Universe, they are also subject to the processes that occur here. One such is decay and disintegration. Therefore, if we think this problem through, there is only one conclusion possible (if we assume that all Indians have not always been imbeciles): the gyaana is about the processes of accessing the real. It is not and cannot be about the real.\nThis means that the debate within the Indian traditions is not and could not have been about the nature of ‘atman’ or ‘Brahman’. Thus, the idea that is propagated as ‘the’ truth about the alleged conflict between the dvaita and the advaita is spurious and false. There was clearly debates and conflicts. But these cannot be about the nature of the real.\nThe same is true about the alleged conflict between ‘Buddhism’ and ‘Brahmanism’. Atman and Anatman are not conflicting doctrines about the real at all; they could not be. It is logically impossible that this was the debate between representatives of these traditions, unless we assume that Indians are congenitally incapable of thinking logically. Those who sell this story, whether in India or abroad, the western savants and their Indian slaves, are the truly perfect imbeciles, which they actually think that Indians are. These idiots are our professors and many guru’s in India and elsewhere.\nThus, we see that Ambedkar and the Ambedkarites (in India and elsewhere today) are total slaves of their western masters. To ‘convert’ from ‘Hinduism’ to ‘Buddhism’, as though they are conflicting religions, is to simply ape the western cretins who have been selling this story for nearly 200 years.\nI just want to draw your attention to some of the implications of Adhyatmic realization. It does not teach you good manners and politeness. It does not teach or preach ‘humility’. True, it teaches how to help people move away from ignorance. But it also generates an internal force that aims at shattering a situation where ignorance parades as knowledge.\n","tags":[],"title":"Brahman: Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 1.iv.10","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/brahman-brihadaranyaka-upanishad-1-iv-10/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","basics","knowledge"],"content":"Assume that you get a Ph.D student who wants to do medical research. He comes to you and tells you that he wants to find out an answer to the burning question about why people get sick. Would you be able to guide this student in answering his question or give one answer to it? Your answer would be: it depends. You would also further say to him, ‘choose a particular disease, choose a particular domain and choose a particular approach within that domain, if you want to do research’. There is no ‘one answer’ to his question. As a research question, you would say it is ill-formed: you have to specify the disease, and choose whether you want to do, say, genetic research or epidemiological research or cell research or…\nThinking further along, suppose now that the student also wants to do further research into the question of how a disease spreads. What would you tell him? Drawing upon the existing knowledge, you would tell him to choose, say, between infectious and non-infectious diseases. While for the first, he could look for the vectors that carry the disease, for the second, if it involves, say metastasis as it is in the case of cancer, he has to choose between different domains and varying approaches.\nShould the student be deeply disappointed that his burning questions, namely, why people get sick and how disease spreads are ‘dismissed’ by you as ill-formed questions for research? And that it is a philosophical question that is irrelevant to his quest?\nIf this is how it is with respect to a domain where we have a great deal of knowledge (and a greater degree of ignorance), how should it be in a domain like culture for which we do not have even a semblance of a scientific theory? That is where we are today and the problems on this forum (and elsewhere) reflect this state of affairs acutely.\nII\nConsider questions of the following sort: Why did Christianity find its origin in the Middle-East and not, say, in India? Why did Indians convert to Islam so massively in the 19th Century? Why did Christianity spread so quickly after Constantine? What accounts for the growth of Western Christianity, while its Eastern variant languished? Why is Islam growing the fastest in the world today? Etc. Etc.\nHere are a few possible answers out of many: a) the presence of Judaism and its messianic tradition; b) because it was economically or politically convenient for Indians to do so; c) because of the state support of Constantine, the persecution of the pagans and the nature of death cults in the Ancient Roman Empire; d) because Christianity pacified Nature and sacralised the world; e) because of the massive financial and other benefits that conversion into Islam entails, Etc. Etc. Add to these some other answers like a) conversion to Christianity requires that the Holy Spirit is active; b) it is the will of Allah and such like.\nEach of these answers, and many more, have been given and continue to be given on the basis of (i) empirical research; (ii) speculations and (iii) theologies.\nWhich of these answers are true or plausible or probable? What would you choose between a ‘political’ answer, a ‘sociological’ answer, a ‘philosophical answer’, a ‘historical’ answer, a ‘theological answer’…etc? Would you choose one, some, all or none? Why? Where (meaning, in which domain) would you look to answer those questions you raise?\nThe previous paragraph tells you that the questions raised in the second paragraph are ill-formed: any and every reply are answers to questions; we do not know where to look for answers because the search-space is very, very broad. We know at least this much about good questions: they narrow the search space. The questions above do the opposite: they broaden the search-space. (Why is the following not an answer to all the questions asked: ‘because Freud’s first name is Sigmund’? You cannot dismiss this as an answer without relying on some or another ‘philosophical’ idea about ‘evidence’ and ‘relevance’, using which one can also dismiss every other answer.)\nThese questions are not scientific: they are commonsense questions that are pseudo-scientific in nature. They appeal only to commonsense because they arise from there.\nIf reformulated, they do make sense: why did Christianity spread as a religion in Europe and the Middle-East? The only answer to this question is theological in nature. Why did people convert to one religion or another? The answer can be theological or something else depending upon how you qualify ‘conversion’: if it carries a theological meaning, the answer cannot be ‘economic’. If qualified, say, sociologically, (say, as the act of baptism or performing some or another ceremony in the presence of a mullah) then a ‘sociological’ answer will do. And so on.\nThe research programme tells us these things too: it allows us to assess the nature of our questions and the nature of contemporary ‘scholarship’ (or what parades as ‘religious studies’ today). Not every question, just because it is ‘investigated’, qualifies itself as scientific research. (After all, one ‘investigates’ before creating a telephone directory. But that does not make this investigation scientific, does it?)\nThe so-called ‘study of religions’ that people carry out today are pseudo-scientific. My research programme, amongst other things, warns you not to fall prey to these pitfalls.\n","tags":[],"title":"Narrowing the search space, Ill-formed questions","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/narrowing-the-search-space-ill-posed-questions/"},{"categories":["History","stories","real"],"content":"Let me begin with the following dialogue between a Swiss-German and a young Balinese (from Bichsel, Peter, Der Leser, Das Erzählen: Frankfurter Poetik-Vorlesungen, 1982, Darmstadt und Neuwied: Hermann Luchterhand Verlag. Pp. 13-14, my translation and italics):\nWhen I discovered, or when it was explained to me, that Hinduism is a pedagogical religion, namely, that in so far as the best “good deed” of a Hindu consisted of explaining something or the other, I lost my inhibitions and began with questions\u0026hellip;\nA young Balinese became my primary teacher. One day I asked him if he believed that the history of Prince Rama\u0026ndash;one of the holy books of the Hindus\u0026ndash;is true.\nWithout hesitation, he answered it with “Yes”. “So you believe that the Prince Rama lived somewhere and somewhen?” “I do not know if he lived”, he said.\n“Then it is a story?”\n“Yes, it is a story.”\n“Then someone wrote this story – I mean: a human being wrote it?”\n“Certainly some human being wrote it”, he said.\n“Then some human being could have also invented it”, I answered and felt triumphant, when I thought that I had convinced him.\nBut he said: “It is quite possible that somebody invented this story*. But true it is, in any case*.” “Then it is the case that Prince Rama did not live on this earth?”\n“What is it that you want to know?” he asked. “Do you want to know whether the story is true, or merely whether it occurred?”\n“The Christians believe that their God Jesus Christ was also on earth”, I said, “In the New Testament, it has been described by human beings. But the Christians believe that this is the description of the reality. Their God was also really on Earth.”\nMy Balinese friend thought it over and said: “I had been already so informed. I do not understand why it is important that your God was on earth, but it does strike me that the Europeans are not pious. Is that correct?”\n“Yes, it is”, I said.\nConsider carefully the claims of this young Balinese. (A) Even though the narrative of events could have been invented and written by a human being, his ‘holy book’ remains true. (B) He does not know, or even interested in knowing, whether Rama really lived but that does not affect the truth of the Ramayana. (C) He draws a distinction between a true story (not just any story, nota bene, but his ‘holy book’) and a chronicle of events on earth. (D) Finally, it remains his ‘holy’ book despite the above or precisely because of it.\nThat is to say, he is indifferent to historical truth and suggests, in the italicized parts of the dialogue, that it is not a proper question to ask; even if it is the invention of a human being and even if it is historically unfounded, the story retains its truth. He correlates impiety with believing in the truth of the Biblical narrative. As I would like to formulate it, not only is the young Indonesian drawing a distinction between a story and a history but is also suggesting that the historicity of the Ramayanais irrelevant to its truth. His stance, I would like to add, is also the stance of many, many Indians, even if subject to some changes during the last few decades.\nIn a way, in the West and elsewhere, we do talk about stories in an analogous fashion. When the Sherlock Holmes Society disputes whether the famed detective ever really said “Elementary, my dear Watson”, the dispute is not whether Sir Arthur Conan Doyle ever wrote such a sentence but whether Sherlock Holmes ever said such a thing. In this sense, we do talk about the ‘truth’ or ‘falsity’ of stories (the way the Indonesian does), even where we know that there is no historical truth to them. In the case of this Indonesian, or the Asian, who believes in his ‘holy books’, the situation is more complicated: in his culture, the Ramayanais ‘true’ even when it is not clear what the status of the book is. Perhaps it is fiction; perhaps it is not. He neither knows nor cares. To know that the Bible is historical, suggests this Balinese, makes the Europeans impious. Impiety is to believe that one’s ‘religion’ is historically true! Many questions emerge, if we read this dialogue carefully: how does the Balinese understand the “historical”? Does the notion make any sense in his mode of going about in the world? Or, is he inferring the “value” of this term from his interlocutor’s account of the Christians?\nWe can say that Sherlock Holmes did not exist, and still argue that it is true that he lived in 221B Baker Street. When we discuss the truth of fictional objects, we know that we are talking about fictions. The “truth” here is unverifiable but experientially accessible; “fiction” can “touch” us. The question about how we can analyse our disputations about the truth of an object or an event in fiction is different from expressing indifference regarding the status of the narrative itself. The first is familiar to us; there are interesting attempts in both literature studies and philosophy of logics to analyse them. I want to draw attention to the second: it does not seem to matter whether the Ramayanais true or not;whether it is fiction or fact. The ‘ontological’ status of the content of the text is irrelevant to its truth.\nTo understand this situation properly, we need a contrast. Let me, therefore, ask the question: How similar is the stance of the Indonesian regarding the Ramayanawhen compared to the attitudes with respect to the Bible? In the last decades, a “narrative criticism” is observable in theological circles. Many advocate that we look at the Bible in its entirety as a series of stories; yet others focus on the New Testament in an analogous fashion. Especially under the influence of the ‘deconstruction’ movement and ‘post-modern theology’, the Greek distinction between mythosand logoshas come under attack and criticism. Are the problems I am trying to formulate comparable to these and allied tendencies?\nBecause much more requires to be said in this context than I can possibly do now, let me rest content with making just two points.\nWhatever the intellectual fashion in Biblical scholarship (or in New Testament studies), we must not forget that they are responses to the historical problems posed by Biblical exegesis. The ‘narrative turn’ is one answer to the problem of the historicity of Jesus and the truth of the Gospels. Even these narrativists, today in any case, would not dream of taking the stance (as Christians, nota bene) that the existence of Jesus on earth is irrelevant to the truth of the Bible. In fact, this turn is predicated on the historical veracity of the New Testament Bible.\nSuppose someone says the following: Jesus might or might not have existed; he might be The Saviour or he might not be; he might have asked Peter to found the Church or he might not have; the Gospels might be the fictitious invention of some four people or it might not be. As far as he is concerned, any of the above possibilities could be true, and the truth or falsity of none of the above affects his belief in the truth of the Gospels. How could we understand such a person? Probably, The Holy Bible is not ‘holy’ to him; perhaps, he sees the Bible as a moral tract or a story-based philosophical treatise on the human condition. Whether or not such an attitude is justified, we know that he cannot really be a Christian.\nThere is a second point. Even where the Gospel is seen as a story, it becomes an object of investigation as a text. Only as a text can the Bible provide ‘knowledge’ (of whatever kind). Such an attitude suggests that knowledge is primarily textual in nature. Consequently, even the narrative turn – if and where it does turn radical – requires knowledge of the text. Further, it will look at the text of the Bible as a story, and will talk about the way the Gospels talk about the world, man and society without, however, being able to look at stories in other ways. That is to say, stories are treated as knowledge-claims about the world.\nThe difference, with respect to the Indonesian, lies along these two lines: to him, the story of Rama does impart knowledge but without it being a knowledge-claim about the world. And to him, stories are ‘true’ not because they are ‘fictions’ and even less because they are historical facts. In that case, what is the nature of such stories and what is the attitude of those who make these stories their own? In simple terms, how do we make sense of this Young Balinese or those many Indians who would agree with him? What is the nature of “truth” involved in the Indonesian’s claim about Rama?\nOn a metaphor and ‘truths’\nTo begin answering these questions, a metaphor could prove useful. Consider a dominant metaphor in Indian culture. Used by the literate and the illiterate alike, it is about ten blind men: while touching and feeling ten different parts of an elephant (tusk, tail, snout, ear, trunk, leg, toenails, skin, back and underbelly), they carry on maintaining that an elephant is that part which he happens to be touching. Such, the wise tell us, is the nature of our disputation. Disputation about what? I will keep the answer in abeyance for the time being but let us say for now that it is about ‘the world’. Coming to grips with this metaphor, however, requires a short philosophical detour through discussions about the nature of ‘truth’ in Indian intellectual traditions.\nOnly for the sake of keeping this detour short, simple and accessible, let me draw on the current claims of Indology and Hinduism studies. These claims postulate rivalry, competition and strife between multiple Indian traditions. Let me create an anachronistic spectrum of Indian traditions where the Advaitictradition stands at one end of the spectrum with the Buddhist traditions at the other end. Both operate with the idea that there are two kinds of truths (Satyadvaya): the ‘Conventional’ (Vyaavahaarika, or Laukika or Praapanchika) and the ‘Ultimate’ (Paaramaaarthika).\nThe conventional truths are true claims about the entities that exist in the world. In some senses, this notion of truth dovetails with what is called the ‘semantic conception’ of truth or, equally often, the ‘Aristotelean conception’ of truth. The conventional truth further includes the ‘pragmatic conception’ of truth. In other words, the semantic and pragmatic conceptions of truth are parts of the conventional conception of truth. This truth is always and only about existing entities (which include objects, events, situations or whatever else) in the world.\nHowever, what is the world and what exists there? The world is everything that was, is and shall be. It includes everything: from primordial matter to ghosts and spirits, if they exist. The ‘world’ is the most inclusive concept we have to accommodate entities that existed, that exist now and shall exist in the future. What exists though? The answer to this question cannot be provided by a philosophical fiat, but only by knowledge. Only knowledge tells us what there is in the world, and this knowledge is always limited, ‘perspectival’ and hypothetical. Knowledge is, in some senses, about empirical properties of the world, as we sometimes use that term. Also, what constitutes knowledge is itself a question in knowledge and both the question and the answers to it are human. As our knowledge of the world evolves, so does our understanding of what human knowledge is. This human knowledge tells us that the world itself is subject to all kinds of changes. Our conventional truths are contextual and evolving: what we believe to be true at some time might turn out to be false later. These truths, like the world about which they are true, are in flux, to use a well-known metaphor. In simple terms, the conventional truths are context dependent and conditional in nature. This is how we must understand our present day claims about such entities as ‘super strings’, ‘dark matter’ and such like. We hypothesize the existence of such entities currently; they might or might not exist, but that is something we shall know only as knowledge evolves.\nHere is the first sense in which the dominant metaphor is suggestive. It tells us that our knowledge of the word is always partial and while partial descriptions are true, they remain partial. They are true of those parts that our knowledge describes but none of these parts tells us what ‘the elephant’ is. However, what is this ‘elephant’, if not a sum of the parts? A knowledge of systems theory of today tells us that the previous question is not proper: the relationship between an elephant and the organs is a part whole relationship, i.e.that it is a mereological relation. A description of the parts of a system, even when such descriptions are true, does not give us a description of the system itself.\nConsider now the fact that while the blind men do have tactile access to parts of an elephant, they have access to the elephant as a creature. Thus, we have access to ‘something’, whose nature we do not know yet. But, in terms of the metaphor, we do not know what the ‘elephant’ is except for the parts about which we have some true descriptions. In and of itself, that need not create any problem because we can generate hypotheses about that entity which has these parts. However, this requires that we know that these partial descriptions, and only these partial descriptions, are descriptions of one and the same entity. However, as blind men, we do not know that: what if there are more than ten blind men some of whom are touching parts of a cat, others parts of a table and yet some others the parts of an automobile and so on? Are we to assume that they are touching one and the same entity or different entities? How can we know that?\nOne possibility is to appeal to human reason. That is to say, if the hypothesis is logical and it explains in a consistent fashion that which we access, then this hypothesis can be considered possibly true. (In this sense, I think there is also the syntactic conception of truth in the Indian traditions.) If there are many such hypotheses then that does not show that only one of them is ‘true’ (even though each adherent to a particular hypothesis thinks that way) because we have no knowledge about the nature of the objects but only some ill-understood access to them. If we confine the debate to the metaphor, that is, agree that the discussion is about what the ‘elephant’ is, we can recognize that a similar debate has taken place in the western intellectual tradition. This is the discussion between the nominalists and the realists (to use one set of labels) about the nature of Universals: what is the ontological status of terms like ‘elephant’, ‘Green’, etc.? Does ‘green’ refer to a world of ‘colour’ or are green objects merely similar with respect to their property of having a colour? Here, given that the proponents in the debate are trying to answer the same question, we can assume that their theories or hypotheses are rival and competing theories.\nConsider now the possibility that this discussion about the elephant and other objects have been going on for some time and that these groups of blind men have evolved criteria to arrive at some kind of consensus about the criteria they use to settle their disagreements. Now, there arrives another group of blind men, who have managed to use knives but without having a tactile access to the surfaces of the objects they have dissected or cut through. Some have dissected an elephant, yet others have failed to saw through its tusk, some have skinned a cat and some others have tried to cut through the table or the automobile and so on. These two groups meet to discuss about the nature of the items they have access to. To keep the discussion simple, let us assume that both groups have reached a consensus about the separateness of these objects. However, their hypotheses about the nature of the objects that the second group has access to diverge radically from the hypotheses that the first group has. To the first group, it is obvious that the entities they have tactile access to are neither soft (tissues) nor mushy (internal organs) and definitely not like liquids (blood). That is to say, the second group of hypotheses goes in a direction that is antithetical to what their knowledge tells them about their access. To the second group, the hypotheses of the first group also contravenes their knowledge. How should they decide what their debate is now about? Is it about the ontological status of the ‘elephant’ (or about the ontological status of the ‘cat’ or ‘the automobile’)? Are they rival hypotheses and competitor theories or merely true descriptions of different levels of what they access?\nThey agree that their hypotheses about the accessible but ill-understood objects are different. They could then either agree that all their different hypotheses are true because they are merely different true descriptions of the different ‘levels’ of the objects they have access to. Or, they might believe in the opposite: that these are rival or competitor theories. No matter how they decide at a later date, how could they linguistically indicate their current situation? That is, how to indicate that the conflict they now have is also about ‘the domain’ these objects inhabit?\nIn a sense, this problem is easily solved. They make a distinction between object and meta-level discussions. Let us say that they agree that the discussion about ‘the world’ is at a meta-level, whereas their disputes about ‘elephants’ and such like are at an object-level.\nLet us now say that in both these groups of blind men, some people discover that next to the objects and their properties they access tactilely, they can also access some propertiesthat are not accessible through their sense organs. That is, they discover that the presence of properties that, using our language, can be called emergent properties. Now, suddenly, huge questions open up that have to do with the status of these: (a) Are there emergent properties in the world? (b) Do they have effects on objects and events in the world? (c) If objects in the world have such properties, does ‘the world’ itself manifest one or more emergent properties?\nSome of these blind men also devise many practical ways to access these properties. Any blind man, if he is willing to follow one of these ways, can testify to accessing these emergent properties. Many people describe their access and, even if they do not call them ‘emergent’, they develop hypotheses to account for their manifestation. These hypotheses, though each is consistent, contravene every object and meta-level consensus, both about the objects in the world and the nature of such a world. How is this discussion to be identified and separated from the earlier discussions? That is, how do these people now indicate that (a) the newly proposed hypotheses are consistent; (b) what these hypotheses postulate are accessible to human experience; (c) these hypotheses, at the same time, speak about properties that contravene everything they individually or as a group know about the world and the objects therein?\nIndian traditions identify and separate such discussions from disagreements about both the objects in the world and about the world. They call the latter as disagreements regarding conventional truth. They separate these from debates about ‘the emergent properties’ by speaking about Ultimate Truth. This domain of the ultimate truth is the domain of ‘Adhyatma’, to use a Sanskrit word. (For the time being, and only for the time being, I will use the word ‘adhyatma’ without explicating its meaning. However, I will come back to this issue soon.) Are we or are we not accessing this domain of Adhyatma too when we access the world?\nHerein, then, lies the peculiarity of the adhyatmic domain. As human beings, we can experientially access it. Conceptually, when one attempts to describe such experiences, it contravenes our knowledge of the world. It is practically accessible in the sense that one can devise different practical methods to access it and even experiment with ways of accessing it. One could even identify, in a variety of ways, the different degrees of access that one has to this domain. We face but two choices to understand this: either dismiss Adhyatmic domain as delusional and confused or attempt to make sense of this domain and our purported access to it. The first approach makes the entire Asian culture into a delusional culture. I prefer the second option.\nTaking the second option requires introducing a philosophical distinction that I cannot argue for in the course of this talk. Let me say objects that populate the world exist. Here, all and only those objects existthat have material or energetic substratum. Our natural and social sciences study existing objects and formulate hypotheses about them. Let me call the adhyatmic domainas the domain of the real. In so doing, I am introducing the distinction between ‘existence’ and the ‘real’: what is real does not exist and what exists is not real.\nAbout the distinction\nTwo issues need tackling when distinctions in natural languages are made: (a) one has to show that the distinction is cognitively fruitful and that (b) it has some linguistic plausibility. Let me begin with the second issue first.\nThe distinction between the real and existence is not as artificial as it looks at first sight. Often, even in English, we ask whether something ‘really’ exists or not, where the word ‘real’ qualifies existence. Mirages exist but they are not considered real, the Lyle-Müller illusion exists but the uneven lengths of the lines are not real, the Sun’s revolution around earth is observed to exist but it is not real etc. That is to say, we often make the distinction (in our daily language) between the ‘Real’ and ‘Existence’, even if we, equally often, run these two words together. I am making this point not to suggest that Adhyatma is akin to earth’s revolution round the sun or whatever but merely to indicate that there is some kind of linguistic plausibility in this case.\nIs the distinction between the real and existence also made elsewhere in western thought? In a sense, yes. God is the real in Christianity. Human beings, according to this religion, cannot talk about God using only human reason. God has to reveal Himself to us and aid us further in our search for Him. He is the Truth we are searching for but this truth cannot be described using only human knowledge. That is the real, as such. However, the relation between the Real and Existence is a matter of discussion, even if it occurs within the framework of the Bible: that issue is about the transcendence and the immanence of God or the Real. In all the three Semitic religions, the Real is sometimes drawn into existence. It is about the reality of existence that western thought and religion is preoccupied with, at times. Consequently, their concerns are different from those of the Indian traditions.\nOf course, to make the distinction between the real and the existence coherent, we need to speak about many other things as well: (a) the relationship between the entities that could exist but do not (e.g. leprechauns, witches and flying pigs) and the real, (b) the relationship between the Universals and the domain of existence and so on. However, this task need not detain us for the moment.\nAll I am suggesting for the moment is that the Indian traditions also make the distinction between real and existence and my proposal is merely to keep this distinction stable for the time being. Henceforth, I shall use the word ‘adhyatmic truth’ instead of ‘Ultimate truth’. Thus there are two kinds of truth: the Adhyatmic truth and the conventional truth. When used with respect to sentences, this distinction suggests that the sentences about the real and existence differ with respect to their property of being truth-or-falsity-bearers (or as bearers of truth values).\nThis is just about the only philosophical apparatus we need in order to begin making sense of the young Balinese, of some aspects of Indian culture and the Indian notion of ‘Itihasa’, which is often translated inaccurately as ‘history’.\n","tags":[],"title":"Blind men and an Elephant: Historicity of Rama","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/blind-men-and-an-elephant-historicity-of-rama/"},{"categories":["enlightenment","real"],"content":"I\nQuestion: “Certainly that Brahman == self-awareness == Atman is also a matter of direct experience, not of intellectual reasoning?”\nLet me first begin with reason and then drift towards experience.\nSuppose, as an expansion of the sentence that ‘Atman is Brahman’, it is said: “Atman and Brahman are identical to each other”. What kind of sense does it make and how do we explain that sense? Let us note that this sentence makes linguistic sense. Therefore, the question is, how do you parse this sentence to bring out that sense?\nConsider the following statement: ‘A’ and ‘B’ are identical to each other. If they are identical, they are indiscernible, i.e, it is not possible to discern them as two different objects. (This is called ‘identity of the indiscernible’ and the formulation is attributed to Leibniz, the philosopher.) Therefore, there is only one object and not two. What then are ‘A’ and ‘B’? Parsing the sentence in such a way that it continues to be true, while remaining loyal to the surface structure of the sentence, we say: “‘A’ and ‘B’ name an object”, i.e. ‘A’ and ‘B’ are two different names for one and the same object. Thus, the sentence actually says: there is one object that is called both ‘A’ and ‘B’. (There is some research done on the notion of ‘logical identity’ and I accept the most coherent suggestion from the literature.)\nThus, the expanded sentence is a shorthand for the following: “There is an ‘object’ that is called both ‘Atman’ and ‘Brahman’. Actually, there is only one object with two different names.” This is what reason tells us.\nWhat about experience? Actually, the experience appears unrelated (sort of) to the sentence that ‘Atman is Brahman’, even though it can be made compatible with the sentence and ‘reason’ without any effort. There is an experience of ‘self-consciousness’ as something that has nothing to do with the ‘I-hood’. This self-consciousness is ‘there’: it cannot be counted ( as ‘one’ or ‘two’ or whatever). It can be fully accessed without effort and it encompasses an entire group (when it is accessed in the presence of my students or when I receive guests I do not know or when I sit in a train amidst strangers, etc.), the environment (when I sit in the garden), or wherever I am. This ‘I’ is ‘full’, ‘complete’, and ‘everywhere’. In this sense, I experience neither ‘Atman’ nor ‘Brahman’, whatever they are. I use these words because they are the best I have to communicate. I can not only make perfect intellectual sense of these words but also relate them to experience. I now know why Shankara speaks of ‘neti, neti’ (not this, not that) when talking about ‘atman’ or ‘Brahman’. What is experienced also does not, strictly speaking, exist but it is real. (Also in the sense that I know I am not hallucinating.)\nThus, what I have done in the note is to attempt an understanding of my experience. I also want to know if what I experience is also what Indian traditions talk about. That appears to be the case because I seem to understand what all the different traditions talk about. (Based on what I know or remember.) Buddha is ‘right’ but so is Shankara. I understand where the disagreement is, what it is, and why, in one sense, it is justified, and why, in another sense, it is unimportant. I now emotionally understand the metaphor of blind men making judgements about the nature of the elephant while touching some of its parts. I see the truth in the ‘purnamidam’ verse from the Upanishads. So on and so forth.\nIn short, I can only give you an intellectual answer. However, I will not say anything that contradicts my experience.\nII\nOne of the realizations: all of us, every human being, is enlightened but we do not realize (i.e., know through experience) that such is the case. There is delusion interfering between us (as we are in our daily life) and this ‘knowledge’. That delusion can be called the ‘I-hood’ (also called the ‘personhood’ in the third person reference to the ‘I-hood’), which is actually a false entity. ‘I-hood’ exists, but it is false. All that is required for enlightenment is that this false entity dies and that there is the ensuing experience of the death of this entity. Of course, a framework that makes sense of this death must also be available in some form or another. In more ways than one, all the Indian traditions have talked about this for millennia and thus the framework is available for all of us.\nMany, many interesting philosophical questions arise from the above formulation. It requires thought and time to sort them out. In the meanwhile, know that true joy is always there with you. All you have to do is to realize this.\n","tags":[],"title":"Brahman and Atman","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/brahman-and-atman/"},{"categories":["enlightenment","Indian traditions","real"],"content":"Some Swamiji claims: “One cannot experience the Atman[, the Atman] is the witness, it is what experiences.”\nObviously, this is a very rough and approximate formulation. This statement is both wrong and right in different ways. (a) In the very early days, when I began to develop my meditation exercise, I ‘sensed’ the vague presence of an observer (somewhere present in the background of my experiential world). Or, you could say, I vaguely sensed that I was being ‘seen’ or that my meditative performance was being performed for an ‘outside’ observer. Perhaps, it would also be accurate to say that I sensed its vague presence outside my meditative world, but touching upon its edges. Later, when I was trying to help other people meditate, I discovered that some sensed this presence too and yet others had to ‘let go’ in order to sense this presence. I am guessing that this is the idea of Atman as a ‘witness’. Some were fearful and afraid of this presence as well. If you say that to sense the vague presence is to experience that presence, the Swamiji is wrong. If you see this vague sensing of a presence (or sensing the vague presence of something) as not experiencing, the Swamij would be right. (b) Does the Atman experience? If you keep the word ‘experience’ sufficiently broad (or nebulous), yes, that is true. Self-awareness is obviously ‘aware’ (working purely at a linguistic level); self-consciousness is obviously ‘conscious’ (I say this in my note as well to understand the access). In this sense, yes, the Swamiji is right. However, the Swamiji is wrong if we claim, which we have to, that experience (as we know it today) requires some kind of bodily constraint (i.e. the presence of an apparatus to experience). We have to say here that self-consciousness is not tantamount to ‘experience’. Then the question opens up: if self-consciousness is not ‘experience’ what else is it? I have no answer except to say that it is ‘self-consciousness’, period. It is also further true, on both accounts, that sentience does not experience self-consciousness but merely accesses it. In that case, the next problem: what does this access generate? Some or another kind of experience or not? If we cannot provide some kind of a satisfactory answer, the word ‘access’ is an occult word and does no work. (These are not the only set of problems, but it does indicate why understanding ‘enlightenment’ is far, far more difficult than achieving that state.)\nI think this is what Darshanas are. They try to make sense of ‘enlightenment’ by developing some kinds of frameworks to make it intelligible. They do not ask the question, how is ‘enlightenment’ possible? They take it as a given that it is both possible, realizable and achieved. The questions are: what is it? How to make sense of it? These Darshanas reflect on the ‘experience’ of enlightenment (huh? ‘the experience of enlightenment’?) by developing theories that try to make logical, linguistic and cognitive sense. The debates between the exponents of these different darshanas are not about enlightenment; they are about the consistency of the descriptions of the state of enlightenment. One major obstacle here is our natural languages: we are constrained by these languages to speak only about ‘existence’ but not about the ‘real’. We can speak about ‘non-existent’ objects, it is true, but only by conferring ‘existence’ to them in an imaginary or conceptual way. We do not know how to speak about a realm beyond existence, which however, is real. Atman, as I say, does not exist but is real. Atman is not out ‘there’ in the world (it does not exist) but it is ‘there’ (it is real, but it cannot be ‘there’ if it does not exist).\nOur natural languages are languages about existence and its opposite non-existence. We need to develop a way of talking that allows us to speak, even when you are not at all speaking about the world. We need to communicate in the world, using languages which can only talk about the world, to say things ‘about’ something else, when there can be no ‘aboutness’ (i.e., when there is no reference or content) to this language.\nI do not know whether I am intelligible or not. This is a huge, huge problem to talk about the state of enlightenment.\n","tags":[],"title":"Atman, Witness, and Experience","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/atman-and-experience/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","real"],"content":"You say that you experienced Shakti as an emanation of a force that is overpowering and palpable; you also say that you felt the ‘presence’ of Shakti strongly. These two sentences make one think that you felt the presence of the force. In that case, there are only two routes open to us: (a) either reject that we have knowledge of the world which forbids linguistic utterances from infusing material objects with ‘life’ forces that can have causal impact in the world; (b) or ‘downgrade’ science as knowledge of the world by allowing ‘spiritual’ (or supra-mundane) worlds to causally interact with the ‘physical’ world. Your own process of thinking about this experience is rigidly hemmed in by these alternatives. Neither, I think, is what you are seeking. If you are, you cannot and will not find what you seek, even if it is to merely figure out your experience.\nWhat other choice do you have? Stop using the learnt modes of talking about your experience. Do not speak in terms of ‘force’, Shakti, and such like. Choose words and phrases carefully and in ways that do not openly and explicitly violate our knowledge of the world, unless you have alternative descriptions of this world that are better than what sciences teach us today. Do not transgress the boundaries of knowledge casually. (Your description does precisely that. You can, of course, challenge our current understanding in physics and biology. However, there are very strict conditions put on what such challenges, if they are to be taken seriously, should do and should be capable of doing. A particular description of an individual psychological experience is not a serious challenge to knowledge at all. If anything, it is utterly frivolous. If you really ‘love to understand what exactly happens’, please remember that, in that case, you are seeking knowledge. You will not get knowledge, if you carelessly and casually transgress the conditions that alone can give you the knowledge you seek.)\nHow could you formulate your experience differently then? Stick to what you went through. You saw (or participated in) an event and you felt some kind of presence. Your question is about what you felt and experienced. And whether this had anything to do with the nature of the event itself or whether it was a mere psychological idiosyncrasy of yourself. No Shakti’s, no mantras and no forces are required in this case. A simple question from someone who simply seeks to know. You think you can do this?\n","tags":[],"title":"Shakti vs. Natural Sciences","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/shakti-vs-natural-sciences/"},{"categories":["Indian traditions","real"],"content":"Consider the fact that the Indian ‘gods’ are portrayed in at least two ways. First, there is their portrayal with four arms (say) and there is their portrayal in completely human forms. Krishna has four arms (with Shankha, Chakra, Gada and Padma or one hand with a blessing palm or downward indicating a mudra of some kind) and he also has a fully human form. The balakrishna’s I have seen give him only two arms. So do many images of Krishna: he has only two arms. However, apart from other symbols (flute, peacock feather, etc), his colour is almost invariant. Ganesha is even more interesting: there are balaganesha’s crawling with two arms and with four arms. There are images of a four-armed Ganesha sitting on the lap of a two-armed Shiva (with and without his third eye but holding a trishula). In any case, he has the elephant head. Most Durga’s have multiple arms, a few frightening heads but there are also those with human form and pretty faces. Same applies to Parvati, Laxmi and Saraswati. Except, of course, they invariably have pretty faces. They too have characteristic traits: seated on Padma, carrying a Veena, or next to Shiva or Ganesha or sitting on top of a mountain surrounded by snowy peaks. There are also others where she is on a peetha or is very well dressed and adorned with ornaments. In short, some or another trait is mostly present that identifies which ‘goddess’ or ‘god’ s/he is. The rest, obviously, is left free. Of course, there are also images that can only be identified, if so identified by local stories, the pujari’s at the temples and so on. If these are our ‘popular gods’, the less-known (say the village ‘goddesses’) are even more problematic. Many village ‘goddesses’ look similarly vague and are almost but not quite amorphous.\nWhen I spoke of the ‘grotesque’ nature of Indian murti’s, the reference was to this entire cluster. Once some kind of an identification is made, the form becomes almost irrelevant. Yet, even there, the attributed forms cannot exist: human forms cannot grow and ungrow four arms, for example. The ‘standard’ form is that of an entity which cannot exist precisely because it also possesses recognizable form. Thus they are not ‘grotesque’ any more than they are ‘beautiful’, but this does not mean that these predicates are not used. Often, one discusses about the ‘beauty’ of a murti or a vigraha or their ‘photo’s’ (as we call them in India); less often, we say that Krishna is more beautiful than Manmatha and my Sanskrit teacher refused to read verses from Kumara Sambhava in the class room, where Kalidasa waxes eloquently about the beautiful body of Parvati in penance. And why say these murti’s are lifeless matter? The garbhagudi of Venkatesha in Tirupati, surely, makes one ask the question what, exactly, is ‘lifeless’ there. Some murti’s and their temples teem with life; some others attract only flies and, occasionally, a few people; yet others, though very famous and well-known, languish in ruins. What, precisely, is ‘lifeless’ matter in these cases?\n","tags":[],"title":"'Grotesque' nature of Murtis","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/grotesque-nature-of-murtis/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","real"],"content":"Two points should be kept in mind before using these examples: (a) the examples illustrate that the distinctions are not unknown to an English language-user (b) the distinction does not require denying the knowledge that we have about the world. These merely indicate that the distinction between ‘real’ and ‘existence’ might be worth a serious investigation.\nA possible set of examples:\nNot Real but exists : the Earth, Planets, Stars, etc.\nNot Real, might or might not exist: the triangles and circles of Euclid\u0026rsquo;s geometry, numbers, sets, etc.\nNot real, exists: the rope mistaken to be a snake (both the rope and the mistake) or my identification of myself with my mind: ‘the misidentification’ could exist; ‘the mind’ might exist; ‘myself’ could exist (if understood as some kind of ‘psycho-social identity’ of an organism; ‘self’ is real but does not exist.\nNot real, does not but could exist: the tooth fairy.\nReal: ‘Something’ that not only does not exist (it is a non-existent ‘object’) but also could not exist. (Sherlock Holmes does not but could exist. The pudding that ate the city of Chicago does not but could exist. ‘Real’ could never exist.)\nMostly, one could ask: ‘But, does it really exist?’. One could always say: ‘I know it is there (i.e. exists), but is it also real’? Etc.\nThese kinds of questions merely indicate that we do find the distinction between ‘real’ and ‘existence’ sensible (not nonsensical, that is) and that we can also ‘judge’ existence by using ‘real’ to qualify it. (‘Because of the mirage it looks as though there is water, i.e. a water source exists; however, it is not real, i.e. it does not ‘really’ exist. ‘It appears as though it exists, but, in reality, it does not’ or ‘it does not exist in reality’ or ‘it does not really exist’, etc.)\nThere are partial and ad hoc attempts to understand this distinction: ‘phenomena’ and ‘noumena’; ‘appearance’ and ‘reality’; ‘appearance’ and ‘essence’, ‘form’ and ‘content’, ‘illusion’ and ‘reality’, etc. These have also enabled many (the post-modernists and the post-colonials for example), often influenced by geniuses like Derrida and Foucault, to rail against ‘essentialism’, ‘binaries’, etc. and thus make a profitable living.\nFurther reflections and investigations are needed to understand the distinction between ‘real’ and ‘existence’. But the distinction is not unknown or queer or nonsensical or rubbish, prima facie. The natural language examples do not accomplish more than noticing this fact. Further research might even show that this ordinary language distinction is mistaken or wrong.\nII\nNatural languages are a source of confusion between Real and Existence. But then, they are also our sources of access. We also ask ‘does it really exist?’; ‘is it real?’ (as in ‘Is it a mirage or is it real?’); ‘come on, get real’, etc. They indicate that ‘existence’ does not intersect ‘real’ and that they are disjoint sets. Why I do not want to use Sanskrit words (so as to avoid confusion) is that this sense of the difference between ‘real’ and ‘existence’ is also present in English and that the Biblical God raises the distinction as a confusion continuously: ‘God is both immanent and transcendent’ is another way is saying that God (and God alone) is both Real and Exists. (That is, other objects are unreal but merely exist.) Thus, no, you do not need to reform yourself; the world has to!\nThe confusion that this Biblical God (or our ways of talking about Him) is located here: God is both Real (Transcendent) and Exists (immanent). Now, they also add, “these are ontologically different from each other” or that “they are of different ontological kinds”. The one is the Creator and the other is its ‘creature’ and thus there is an ontological gulf between the two. The problem is: ontology is (and can ONLY be) about what exists in the world. Thus, when one distinguishes between God as the creator and the World as His creature “ontically”, one gets crucified: God becomes an existent (thus His immanence), when He is the Real (thus His Transcendence). He ‘is’ Outside Time and Space but because He ‘is’, He is forced or compelled into existence in the World. The lesson? The distinction between ‘the real’ and ‘existence’ is NOT an ontological (or an ontic) distinction; they are not different in Kind (ie., they do not have different kinds of existence). This, at least, is a lesson from our traditions.\nIII\nIf one says Atman is “the only thing” that exists, one’s dispute with me is about the use of a word alone. Nuclear bombs, gravitational waves, trees, Humans… etc. possess properties that Atman does not and the other way round. If all these objects “exist” because of these properties (or have “existence” as a property) their existence establishes the non-existence of Atman. If, on the other hand, one wants to reserve the word ‘existence’ to Atman then all these objects do not and cannot exist. In that case one better quickly give another word because, without it, one is forced to say: “Non-existent nuclear bombs CAUSE Non-existent damages in the non-existent world” and so on.\nIn simple terms: Atman does not have any of the properties of objects, events, processes, in the world. Whether existence accrues to these objects because of these properties or whether they possess existence as a property, their existence establishes the non-existence of Atman. Hence the distinction between ‘real’ and ‘existence’: Atman is real but has no existence.\nIV\nYou ask: “Since personhood exists, why can\u0026rsquo;t one study it scientifically or why can\u0026rsquo;t one produce knowledge about an entity that exists? If it exists, it can\u0026rsquo;t be a hipkapi. If this is the case, whats wrong with studying personhood? So, can you shed light on the relationship between sat(asat) and existence?”\nThese are very, very difficult questions to answer at this moment. Can we study the ‘movement’ of the sun across earth? Yes, in some senses, we can: we can say where the sun will be at noon, its movement during winter, predict sunrise and sunset and so on. Is this knowledge? Again, in some senses, it is. We can understand ‘personhood’ in these senses only. We do not hallucinate when we observe the movement of sun; neither do we hallucinate when we ‘experience’ (or perceive) personhood. However, we do not understand the relationship between earth and the sun by studying the ‘movement’ of sun across earth. That is how it is with personhood. We do not understand human beings (or much about their psychology) by studying personhood.\nNo, personhood is not a hipkapi. It exists, but it is not real. There is a distinction between ‘existence’ and ‘reality’: what merely exists is not Real(Sat). Asat is what merely exists. Personhood exists. What exists is born and also dies. Personhood has to die (literally), if enlightenment is to be realized. The ‘real’ is experiential in nature; ‘existence’ need not be.\nIt is very difficult to get hold of this distinction because of English language intuitions. If existence is defined in terms of physics, i.e., as anything that must have a material or energetic substratum, then the real does not exist. If something can exist without such substrata, then the real also exists.\nIn a less interesting way, we run into a similar problem with respect to ideas (or mathematical objects). Is there a separate realm of ideas or are they reducible to brain states? It is less interesting because the ‘Self’ that enlightenment speaks about is an emergent property and is irreducible.\nThis brings me to the next set of issues: “What is your present take on mind-body problem\u0026ndash;esp mind-body reduction and mental causation? Which thesis does your enlightenment support? Epiphenomenal emergentism? Please also address intentionality and phenomenal consciousness.”\nEnlightenment does not address this problem at all; it is, in a specific sense, indifferent to this problem. Consciousness is a natural phenomenon of certain kinds of organisms. Intentionality, in all probability, indexes the presence of personhood. Hence, the fuss made around it. The ‘Self’ is an emergent property but it is not an epiphenomenon. If intentionality is seen as person-related capacities (to hope, to dream, to have projects, to have ambitions, etc.), then they disappear with enlightenment. If it is seen as ‘aboutness’, i.e., the abilities to talk about the world, to have beliefs, there is nothing mysterious about these abilities, even if we do not yet know what this ‘aboutness’ is.\nFor the time being, just one more point. There are three kinds of ‘I’: the body or the organism, the personhood (the so-called ‘ego’) and the ‘Self’. We conflate all three into one single ‘I’ and western philosophies talk about this conflated ‘I’. Therefore, they are untrue and, at the same time, contain fragments of truth. It is very, very difficult at this stage to separate them out conceptually and generate a coherent discourse.\nThis difficulty is compounded by two other facts: (a) there is also an internal relationship between the three different ‘I’s and (b) a peculiar relationship between the ‘I’ and the ‘You’. The point is this: ‘ahamkara’ refers not just to the ‘I’ but also to the ‘you’. To speak of a ‘you’ is as much an expression of ‘ahamkara’ as is speaking about the ‘I’. However, language (for most part) requires both the ‘I’ and the ‘You’. They could be seen as grammatical subjects which facilitate communication. One could also use the ‘I’ to refer to the organism. But all of these make communication very complicated and even esoteric. (Hence the need for metaphors and imageries.)\nIn short: there are umpteen inherited ideas. Enlightenment seems to challenge most of these. Thought and reflection, when guided by experience, might untangle some of these knots.\nV\nou should not translate paramartika as \u0026rsquo;noumenal reality\u0026rsquo; because noumenon is unknowable whereas paramarthika is experienceable and knowable: that at least that is the claim. So noumenal reality can never be used for paramarthika. If you want to use the word you must have some philosophical understanding of Kant and not simply say that since other have people used the term I will do so also. It would mean that \u0026ldquo;I am now using methods for which I have criticized the Europeans\u0026rdquo;. (pp. 122-3 of \u0026ldquo;Classical Indian Thought and the English Language\u0026rdquo; edited by Mullick, et al.)\n","tags":[],"title":"Examples of Real vs. Existence","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/examples-of-real-vs-existence/"},{"categories":["bullshit","real"],"content":"Question: I have some problems understanding apara, para, existence, and presence. Apara exists, but is not present; para is present but does not exist. Are you saying that what is present does not exist, what exists is not present? If so, how can you reconcile with our common sense notion that what exists is present? Even though presence doesn’t imply existence, we can’t say that existence imply non-presence. So, this is an issue of definitional equivalence: para = presence; apara = existence.\nThere are (at least) three sources generating the problems that you signal. First, therefore, the sources:\n(a) The post tried to relate ‘para’ and ‘apara’ to the English language-use. In doing so, it tried to keep to a simple word-usage and avoid convoluted formulations. However, the English words (‘present’ and ‘presence’) themselves have multiple linguistic and grammatical functions and roles. These could not be taken into consideration. This fact complicates matters and generates problems.\n(b) Our common-sense notions and linguistic uses merely indicate that ‘para’ and ‘apara’ are known and familiar even to those who do not know Sanskrit. They are also indicators of how we deal with living and our daily experiences. These will play an important role as ‘evidences’ only at a later stage of hypothesis formation. (Your question about reconciling common-sense notions arises only at that stage.)\n(c) The distinction (between ‘para’ and ‘apara’) is difficult to understand and conceptualize. Hence the reason why many brilliant minds could only raise but not answer questions about the ‘grotesque’ forms of the Indian ‘gods’. The innumerable discussions about ‘murthypuja’, ‘idolatry’, etc. over centuries attest to this difficulty.\nSecond, now to the problem itself. The answer is this: ‘presence’ and ‘present’ are distinguished from each other. In the form of a slogan, here is the difference: what is present might or might not have an accessible ‘presence’; however, ‘presence’ is always there in the ‘present’. (One possible heuristic to keep this distinction in mind is to think about ‘presence’ as another word for ‘real’. However, because of the complex roles played by the word ‘present’ (it is a noun, an adjective, a transitive verb etc.), it is difficult to use it as a synonym for ‘existence’ and draw a consistent contrast between ‘presence’ as ‘real’ and the ‘present’ as ‘existence’.)\nConsider the six sentences where the word ‘present’ is used in the previous post. The explications, hopefully, will reduce your problems.\n1. “(a) Access of any kind requires that the accessed ‘object’ is present in the world; (b) ‘presence’ of an ‘object’ does not imply or mean its ‘existence’”.\nThe sense that (b) tried to convey could not be captured if (a) was formulated as: “the accessed object is ‘there’ in the world” or “is ‘available’ in the world” and so on. ‘Exists in the world’ is not possible in this context. The idea was to draw attention to the word ‘presence’ in the hope that the word ‘present’ in (a) would then get an added dimension, namely, as ‘present-in-the-world’ (to be read as one word). Perhaps, you could read (a) as: …‘present (in some sense)’…, if that helps. Or, having once read the sentence in its current formulation, it could be re-read as ‘there-in-the-world’ (again, as one word). The simplest formulation of (a), after reading both the sentences is this: ‘presence’ is accessible only if it is present in the world (But it does not exist.).\nThe previous suggested re-reading gets formulated later: “As a slogan: no presence outside existence. If anything is present, it is and must be there in this world.” Thus, for instance, you can read the second sentences as: “if anything is there, it is there in the world”.\nThe above considerations should make sense of the following two sentences: “we are accessing ‘objects’ that do not exist but are present (could be read as: ‘are there-in-the-world’) in the world. In more general terms: one accesses things that are present (again, ‘are there-in-the-world’) without requiring that they exist”. In this and the previous point, the same contrast is repeated: ‘present’ is used as a noun here, contrasting it to ‘existence’.\nThe last two uses: “‘Para’ has to be present in the world, but it does not exist…The ‘brahma-in-the-para’, ‘parabrahman’, must be present in the world.” Again, the same point: ‘existence’ is contrasted to ‘present-in-the-world’ or ‘there-in-the-world’.\nA choice was made not to use hyphenated words (‘there-in-the-world’, for example) because this is how words from some continental languages (German, French, Dutch, etc.) are translated into English. The attempt was to formulate some thoughts in English but not to translate continental European languages into English. In such cases, the hyphenated words become clumsy or technical or appear long-winded.\nWith these said, to the questions you ask: (a) “Apara exists, but is not present”. Apara exists, yes, but it is notpresence. (b) ‘Para is present but does not exist’. No, ‘para’ is presence and it does not exist. (c) “Are you saying that what is present does not exist, what exists is not present?” No, presence does not exist and what exists is not presence. (d) “we can\u0026rsquo;t say that existence imply non-presence”. Yes, we cannot, because of the dependency relationship between existence and presence. One could say: ‘if there is existence, it implies that presence is manifest there’ or ‘where there is existence, presence is manifested’. If one does not make a fine-point of it, one could say: ‘existence has presence’ because presence is manifest only in existence. (If it helps, read ‘manifest’ as the Sanskrit ‘pratyaksha’.)\nAs indicated, the word ‘present’ has multiple linguistic functions because of which it is also possible to use it as a synonym for ‘presence’ at times. Such formulations facilitate smooth writing. At other times, they can be sharply contrasted with each other. One has to keep the context in mind to decide which is the case. Consider: (a) ‘Even though he was present at the meeting, actually he was not (present)’; (b) ‘He was present there as the great spiritual leader but had all the presence of a wet rag or a dead-frog’; (c) ‘Even though the same house is present in all the photographs, because of the face lift or the redesigning, it now gets a striking presence in the last two photos’; (d) ‘Even though he was not present at the gathering, his presence could be vividly felt’ ; (e) ‘Was he present at the meeting? My God, was he present?’; (f) ‘He really has a palpable presence’ or ‘he was explicitly (or palpably) present’; etc. etc.\n(e) Thus, in one sense, yes, “para = presence; apara = existence”. Here, the focus is on the meaning of the Sanskrit word ‘apara’, which means the NEGATION of the ‘other of’. Then, existence could be seen as the NEGATION of the ‘other of’. Yet, in another sense, if we focus on the English word ‘existence’, that is not the case: ‘existence’ is also predicated of the Universe or Cosmos (the Sanskrit ‘Vishwa’ or even ‘Iha’), as in, say, ‘The World exists’ or ‘the Cosmos or the Universe exists’. In that case, both para and apar ‘exist’. Then, ‘existence’ is not a-para; it is not the NEGATION of ‘other of’, i.e. para.”\nThe Christian way of resolving this issue is well-known to us today: ‘para’ is outside the Cosmos, the Universe or the World. ‘Para’ names where the Christian God is; that is, outside the world, the cosmos, the universe. It becomes the ‘real world’, the ‘true world’, contrasted to which stands our ‘mundane world’, the ‘unreal world’, ‘the false world’, ‘the illusory world’, etc. The Sanskrit ‘a’ then becomes a very deep negation: a-para becomes the logical negation of ‘the true’, ‘the real’, the ‘spiritual’ etc.; then it can only be the ‘false’, the ‘unreal’, the ‘material’ and the ‘mundane’. The world becomes ‘asat’, ‘apara’, ‘maya’, which is invariably translated as ‘illusion’, and even ‘mithya’ (a ‘fable’ as the word is translated). Today, this story is sold by all and sundry as ‘Indian culture’, ‘Indian religion’ and ‘Indian thought’. Christianity has truly become ‘Catholic’, i.e. ‘universal’. (Thus, our souls could finally get saved; even if ‘salvation’ (here) merely means an invitation to give a talk, if not a faculty position, at Columbia, Princeton or Chicago. Yet others might wish to be more modest and try to save their souls in ‘humbler’ ways, including merely holding forth at home to a ‘captive audience’.)\nBriefly: yes, para=presence and apara=existence. This translational issue is easily solved. The problem does not lie here, but begins thereafter.\nTo which culture do you want to map these languages and translations? By using Marx, Foucault, Derrida etc. (or their Indian counterparts) to bullshit about ‘enlightenment’, ‘para and ‘apara’ and ‘atman and arivina niluvu’ etc., one is simply slavishly reproducing the extant mapping of India to western Christianity. Here it is of no consequence whether one speaks in Kannada, Tamil, Telugu or Sanskrit. It remains bullshit because the problem is not which language one uses (or whether Sanskrit words can be ‘ever be translated’ into English) but on the mapping between languages and cultures. This mapping occurs at a conceptual level, both in the background and when one puts on an explicit ‘intellectual’ cap. This is the familiar route.\nThe research programme that I am outlining chooses another route: it begins to map these languages and translations to Indian culture and her traditions. Yes, there are and will be many problems; yes, there is no established market; yes, one will not be rewarded by fame and fortune. The question is: what does one want?\nJust a small word of warning: There is a cottage industry in philosophy that rails against ‘the metaphysics of presence’. Here, ‘presence’ means objects that exist and refers mostly to objects that are currently at hand. Here, ‘presence’ is equated with objects that are ‘present-and-at-hand’. If possible, avoid dipping into the products produced by this cottage industry.\nzrp:ldne2\n","tags":[],"title":"Para vs. Apara","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/para-vs-apara/"},{"categories":["enlightenment","real"],"content":"It would be a good thing to narrow-in on the ‘spookiness’ of the accessing \u0026lsquo;Real\u0026rsquo;. However, because there is a very great danger that ‘access’ can be conceptualised as an access to a ‘supra-mundane’ or a ‘spiritual’ world, or to a world that is not accessible to ‘sciences’ but can be ‘spiritually’ accessed, etc. a few extra words are required. Therefore, an attempt that might reduce one possible kind of spookiness that you might be referring to.\nIs it possible to speak of accessing ‘things’ that might not exist in the world? Yes, we do it all the time. For the time being, all our sciences depend on this possibility. Mathematical objects, ideas, belong here; so do entities like ‘meaning’ and ‘knowledge’. The so-called ‘Platonic forms’, the ‘Platonic world of ideas’; the so-called ‘third world’ of Popper, the philosopher of science; the endless debates about whether there is a Mathematical world (in which, sets, numbers and infinity, etc. exist) that one accesses (the so-called Platonism in Mathematics); whether mathematical objects exist in the world or in ‘another’ world, namely the ‘mathematical world’, etc.; what ‘meaning’ is (whether or not ‘meaning’ is in the head, or in sentences, or in the world or somewhere else); what ‘knowledge’ is (is it a set of sentences or theories, or beliefs, etc.)… These are discussions about the question whether objects require to ‘exist’ to be accessible. If mathematical infinity does not ‘exist’, what does it mean to perform mathematical operations on them on which our modern day physics rests on? How is it possible that operations on such objects (assuming they do not exist) could ever tell us anything about the physical world? Etc. Etc. Thus, there is nothing ‘spooky’ about either the question or even a positive answer to it, when asked: could we access ‘objects’ that do not exist? Apparently, every single great mathematician is platonic; all of them believe in the existence of a ‘mathematical world’. That is, they ‘see’ and work with ‘objects’ that apparently do not exist but, because they are unable to think how such entities are ‘accessible’, the ‘existence’ of a mathematical world gets postulated. When they say such a world ‘exists’, all they mean is that they are accessible. ‘Existence’ is required because they cannot see how objects that do not exist could ever be accessed. Attempts to speak about ‘para’ as another, different kind of ‘world’ simply track this mode of speech.\nOf course, in a very specific sense, such objects do ‘exist’. It is not possible that there could be ‘thoughts’ of any kind (logical, linguistic, mathematical, artistic, etc.), if there is no material/energetic foundation or sub-stratum to thought. (This is what our current knowledge says about the world.) Hence the enormous attraction of ‘reductionism’, when talking about mind/brain issue: human thinking (of every kind) is founded on and therefore reducible to brain activities. Or, in more general terms, all sciences are reducible to physics. However, note that both the attraction of such programmes and reactions against these revolve around the ‘spookiness’ of the idea that one could access objects even if they do not exist. Because of this, one camp gives such objects ‘existence’ in special ‘worlds’: the mathematical world, the logical world, the linguistic world, the psychological world, the artistic world, the universe of discourse and so on, including the spiritual world, the supra-mundane world, the adhyatmic world, etc. etc. The number of ‘worlds’ that populate the world has become infinite today. The other camp denies these ‘special’ worlds in one domain only to countenance the existence of many such worlds ‘elsewhere’ or constantly try to deny such worlds and their existence. In short, there is nothing spooky about the question itself; it is very well-known to us throughout more than 2000 years of history of the West. The same applies to the answers.\nThis ‘spookiness’ goes away completely, if one realises the following two points: (a) Access of any kind requires that the accessed ‘object’ is present in the world; (b) ‘presence’ of an ‘object’ does not imply or mean its ‘existence’. The first point, in some senses, rests on multiple sources: from trivial considerations about human psychology, through our theories in physics and biology to deep philosophical disquisitions. The second point could be illustrated as a very obvious ‘of course’ thus:\nConsider statements of the following kind: ‘he is charismatic’; ‘he has presence’; ‘he has a magnetic personality’; ‘her beauty is blinding’; ‘people notice his presence in a room’; ‘this house has character’; ‘there is something attractive in this wood’; ‘there is something to this painting, or poem or sculpture’; ‘I was moved deeply by this symphony of Bach today’, etc. etc. etc. ‘Charisma’ or ‘magnetic personality’ might be a called a trait of an individual; but of what kind? ‘Beauty’ might be ‘skin-deep’, but, again, of what kind? Do houses, woods, etc. have ‘characters’ and, if they do, of what kind?\nWhen you look into such statements and experiences, you notice that these words do not, could not, indicate any kind of property or trait as we use and understand these terms. We do not mean that a magnetic personality means that the personality of the person has a property or trait that is similar to something like ‘shyness’ or ‘abrasiveness’, ‘kind’ or ‘vulgar’, etc. The word picks out something else. We do not use the word ‘repulsive’ to speak about a ‘magnetic’ personality, even though we do know that like-poles of a magnet repulse. What do we do then? One route: these exist in a ‘Platonic’ world. Second route: in a very non-trivial sense, what we are saying in every such statement is that the properties or traits spoken about should not be understood as things that exist. They cannot be predicated of people or objects the way we normally do: there is a difference between a ‘neurotic’ personality and a ‘charismatic’ personality and one of the differences lies in the fact that ‘neurosis’ and ‘charisma’ cannot be used the same way while speaking about personalities. In very simple terms: these terms indicate that we are accessing ‘objects’ that do not exist but are present in the world. In more general terms: one accesses things that are present without requiring that they exist. Even briefer: presence does not mean existence. However, both are in the world.\nOf course, there are questions: what is presence, if it is not existence? How does one access presence? Etc. However, this situation is not ‘spooky’; we do it all the time and such language-use is very familiar to all of us. We might not have knowledge about ‘presence’ and various modes of accessing presence; but spooky, it definitely is not. There is nothing spiritual or extra-mundane about something that human beings do all the time. However, know this much: presence is always predicated upon (or ‘manifest’ in) existence. As a slogan: no presence outside existence. If anything is present, it is and must be there in this world, dependent in some way or another on existing objects. This is as hardnosed a ‘materialism’ as it can get.\nConsider, in this light, the ‘Asato ma’ shloka: ‘through’ (not, ‘from’) asat to sat, through tamas to jyoti (not ‘from’), through ‘mtrityu’ to ‘amritam’ (not ‘from’). It is only through samsara (not ‘from’) that you reach ‘moksha’. This is the ‘para’ of Indian traditions. ‘Para’ has to be present in the world, but it does not exist. It is only through ‘apara’ (the not-para) that you can access ‘para’. The ‘brahma-in-the-para’, ‘parabrahman’, must be present in the world and is accessible only through ‘apara’. Where is this para, then? Only possible answer: everywhere. In this ‘pillar’? as the father of Prahlada asked. Yes. But as something that does not and could not possibly exist: as Narasimha. Sarvam khalvidam brahma. Why? Para, because it is not an object in the world, cannot be unique either. Presence is either everywhere in the world or it is nowhere. ‘Presence’ is neither one (‘monism’) nor two ( a possible reading of ‘a-dvaita’). You cannot map the domain of numbers to presence for the simple reason that ‘presence’ is not a domain. Hence there can be no mathematical function that can do the mapping.\nA-para is ‘not para’, i.e., it is not presence. This ‘apara’ exists in the world, in ‘iha’. ‘Iha’, the world, has no negation in Sanskrit: there is no ‘A-iha’. Stands to reason: there is only the world, there is nothing outside the world. Therefore, the Indian languages do not allow a negation of ‘Vishwa’ either (a-Vishwa, for instance). Para is not the negation of ‘iha’; para only means the ‘other’.\nHopefully, however cryptically, the point is clear: there is no room in the Indian traditions for ‘the spiritual’, ‘the mystical’, the ‘supra-mundane’, ‘the Divine’ and such like. There has never been. Why then, today, is such talk peddled all over the world as ‘the’ characteristic property of Indian ‘religions’ and Indian culture? This, of course, is a question of primary importance to all of us.\nJust one request to the possible readers of these and similar, other posts. Please do not palm-off these thoughts as your own without understanding what is being said. The problem is not one of stealing ‘my’ ideas without due acknowledgement. It is of an entirely different kind: when you indulge in this kind of plagiarism or dissimulation (using formulations without knowing what they are trying to say as though they are your own and, thus, you know what they say), while ‘honestly’ expressing your ‘indebtedness’, I am compelled to stop using these terms, concepts and languages. Then, these ideas cannot be developed any further. It has happened many times in the past. Please: do not damage the project because you want to be recognised as an ‘original’ thinker. The project is far too important to be used for such a trivial purpose.\nzrp:ldne1\n","tags":[],"title":"Accessing 'Para' (Real)","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/accessing-para-real/"},{"categories":["enlightenment","bullshit","real"],"content":"Let us agree on the proposed division into two categories: “1) That which exists or could exist (2) That which could not and does not exist but is present (therefore ‘Real’)”. Let us also accept that (1) collects: “(a) everything that we know like Earth, stars, mud, (b) everything that we can think of or imagine - models, formulas, triangles, present and future scientific theories, tooth fairies, ‘murtis’ of Ganesha, methods or procedures of performing ‘abhisheka’ etc. (these exist and could exist in our minds, even the ‘Real’ we imagine still belongs here as long as it is an imagined object)”\nLet us also agree: “So our traditions recommend actions that, when followed, can lead to the ‘Real’ which does not exist but is present. (This is where, your sentence in one of your posts that speaks of “\u0026hellip;the fruit” at the end of the Nirvana Shatkam exercise, in the strictest sense of the term would be ‘gyana’ or ‘knowledge’ of the ‘Real.’\nThe shloka ‘asato ma sat gamaya\u0026hellip;’ that you wrote about, talks about traversing through…(1) to reach (2).”\nA word or two about the deletions. Two sentences have been deleted: “\u0026hellip;it turns out that (a) and (b) together would exhaust everything we can grasp with Physics, language and the mind. The ‘Real’ in (2), our traditions can point to but not express with tools of the mind.”\nThe reason for deleting the above two sentences is this: since your question is about the possibility of “testing or discovering the distinction” between ‘real’ and the ‘present’ intellectually, let us not begin by the assuming the answer. If we assume that the ‘real’ cannot be grasped with language and mind, and that it cannot be expressed with “the tools of the mind”, then your question, “how can one test for this or make or discover this distinction intellectually?” can only have one answer, which you also give: “I think the answer has to be that one cannot”. Let us, therefore, take your question seriously and think about it; let us not assume an answer is true, before the question has even been formulated. In that case, an additional advantage accrues: you say, “As far as I know, all ‘gyaanis’ also report that the ‘Real’ is beyond intellectual reach.” This thought, if not its formulation, would then become a sort of ‘test case’ or an adequacy condition: does the answer succeed in accounting for (or shed some light on) such reports? Such a move will restrict the possibility of giving an ad hoc answer to your question. Finally, a caveat: let us not get distracted by the word ‘present’. We are talking about ‘presence’ as contrasted with ‘existence’. With these preliminaries out of the way, let us begin.\nYour question is this: “How can one distinguish between something that could exist, as in category (1) and something that absolutely cannot and does not exist BUT IS PRESENT \u0026ndash; I mean how can one test for this or make or discover this distinction intellectually?”. Let us split the sentence up after the ‘em-dash’ and approach each of the parts sequentially.\n1. Can one “make” this distinction? That is, is it possible to make this linguistic distinction? Yes, because it has been made; yes, it is also semantically and logically sensible: ‘existence’ collects items in (1) and ‘presence’ is anything not collected by it. Is there linguistic evidence for such a distinction? That is, is this distinction technical and linguistic in nature (like ‘graphemes’ and ‘phonemes’: we neither write graphemes nor hear phonemes) or is there evidence for that distinction in language-use? No, it is not technical. Previous posts gave multiple examples: of the word ‘real’ qualifying ‘existence’ (‘does it really exist?’, for example) that demonstrates the use of this distinction in daily language-use; of the use of ‘presence’ that distinguishes it from ‘existence’. (Properties that we use to identify objects, events and processes that might or might not exist in the world are differentiated from ‘presence’: the word ‘charisma’ in ‘he is charismatic’ does not pick out a property of a ‘personality’, whether the latter exists or not, for example.) Thus, yes, we, the users of natural language, do make this distinction and, yes, it does make psychological and linguistic sense. Can one make a ‘conceptual’ distinction? That is, can one make this distinction theoretically or conceptually? Two general answers: (a) any theory about human language-use has to account for the linguistic and psychological evidence. Thus, yes, it is possible to make such a theoretical or conceptual distinction. (b) While it is possible that this language-use is wrong (using the word ‘fish’ to name ‘whales’, for example), only knowledge can settle this issue (the way the theory about ‘mammals’ in biology solved this issue of language-use). That is, the situation demands and requires knowledge to settle the issue whether or not one ‘could’ make the distinction that we make. Therefore, yes, one can make this conceptual or theoretical distinction.\nSummarizing: yes, we can and do make the distinction between ‘real’ (‘presence’) and existence. There is nothing problematic about making the distinction. If one wants to deny the distinction, one better have a very, very robust theory that tells us why and how we could be wrong. No philosophical fiat or linguistic stipulation can do this job.\n2. Can one ‘discover’ this distinction? That is, is the distinction fictitious or is it ‘there’ in the world? (The most natural formulation, ‘Is the distinction ‘real’ or ‘imaginary’?’, has been avoided for obvious reasons.) Two general points: (a) People see, hear and experience the difference. Unless people from all cultures are hallucinating and because people talk sensibly and understandably about the world using this distinction, it must be ‘there’ in the world. (Of course, it could be the case that people are wrong; but, then again, we need an extraordinarily robust theory to tell us that our experiences are hallucinations. This is an issue for knowledge.) (b) The Indian traditions do not countenance (either linguistically or conceptually) any access to anything that is not there in ‘the World’ (Vishwa). ‘The World’ is everything that was, is and shall be. Nothing in the past or in the future is so distant that it is not ‘there’ in the world; everything accessible item (whether Pitruloka, Swarga, Atman, Brahman, Kuurma or Narasimha, Shunyata or the Tathagata….) has to be in ‘the World’. (Even collective ‘hallucinations’ have to be ‘there’ in the world.) Therefore, the Real must be there ‘in the world’: ‘para’, the ‘other’, must be ‘there’ in the world (Vishwa), if it has to be accessible. Apparently, according to Indian traditions, it is accessible. Thus, the distinction is ‘discoverable’.\n3. Can one ‘test’ for this distinction? This can be read as a request for criteria to distinguish between real and existence. However, if read that way, the answer is not satisfying: our criteria to make this distinction (and understand it when made) are implicit. We do not need the criteria to be available explicitly to talk, communicate or experience. In a sense, it begs the questions already dealt with: can we ‘make’ or ‘discover’ the criteria? To this, the answer is also known to the US public: ‘Yes, we can!’\nLet us try one half-way house reading: is it possible to formulate criteria that help us distinguish in ‘unfamiliar cases’, whether something is ‘presence’ or whether it is ‘existence’? We could, if ‘presence’ itself were (or had some or another kind of ‘property’ that distinguished it from) a property that objects, events and processes have or possess. However, this problem gets crucified immediately: presence is different from existence precisely because it is not any kind of property that objects, events and processes in the world have or possess; it does not even possess or have the property of ‘existence’, if that is seen as an ‘ontological’ property of existing objects; it is not even something that ‘could’ but does not exist. Because it is neither an existent nor a non-existent object, it does not and cannot possess any property that these objects possess; nor can it possess ‘existence’ as a property, if that property exists. It is the ‘para’ (the ‘other’) that is either the ‘other’ of ‘iha’ (if ‘iha’ is ‘existence’, it is the ‘other’ of existence) or the ‘other’ that is negated by ‘a-para’ (‘the non-other’). Both, however, are in Vishwa. Existing objects, processes and events in ‘the world’ (if ‘apara’ is existence) are the negations of the ‘presence’ or ‘the real’. Existence becomes ‘Unreal’ but only the ‘Unreal’ can exist. ‘Apara’ is the ‘only thing’ that exists. This half-way house reading gets crucified because it seeks ‘properties’ in order to distinguish between the ‘Real’ and ‘existence’, when neither the ‘existence’ nor the ‘non-existence’ of properties could possibly distinguish the ‘Real’ from ‘existence’. Therefore, we cannot ask for criteria to find out whether an ‘unfamiliar’ item in the world exists or whether it is the ‘Real’. We can distinguish only by using properties of some kind or another. If this ‘unfamiliar’ has ‘unfamiliar properties’, it is an object that exists with ‘unfamiliar properties’. The ‘real’ is tightly connected to this ‘unfamiliar object’ as well, not as some or another property but the way it connects to ‘familiar’ objects. The ‘Real’ must manifest itself in this unfamiliar object as well.\nLet us now try another half-way house reading: Is this a ‘true’ or a ‘false’ distinction? Here, the crucifixion is equally painful but a bit more helpful. What could ‘truth’ mean in this case? If it means whether we can give a true or false description, the crucifixion is painful: no, we cannot generate true or false sentences about ‘the real’ because these words require mapping the domain of sentences to the domain of objects, events and processes in the world. The function can only map properties (or their instantiations) to sentences. That is, the mapping can occur only within the domain of existence. (This is a simple formulation. More is not required at this moment.)\nThe more helpful aspect of the crucifixion would slightly reformulate the question: Is it possible to have knowledge of ‘the real’? When we try to answer this, the accrued advantage (spoken of earlier) becomes visible: if we can have knowledge, why then have ‘gyaanis’ found it difficult to speak (clearly, lucidly and transparently) about ‘the real’? Thus, for the pain to become helpful, you need to shift the terms of the question from ‘truth’ to ‘knowledge’.\nTo keep the reflections simple and manageable, barebone outlines of two issues are required. Please keep in mind that these formulations are meant only to facilitate the thinking process and do not perform other functions. Further, the following convention is used: ‘accessing the real’ is seen as a process; the word ‘enlightenment’ refers to this process, while abbreviating the phrase ‘accessing the real’. That is, ‘enlightenment’ is about a ‘process of accessing the Real’.\nThe first issue is to avoid waiting pitfalls. One such is the word ‘enlightenment’ itself. The word connotes a huge set of thoughts and emotions, and generates wants and desires of all kinds. Therefore, let us clear our minds by taking up less confusing images to avoid the traps that await us.\nMost human beings, much like you and me, very often (if not mostly) find themselves in unhappy situations or feel unhappy about something or the other in the world. (‘Unhappiness’ is a generic word here that merely helps you identify the situation, however you might want to name it: sad, worried, disturbed, not content, upset, uncomfortable, etc. etc. could also do the same job as ‘unhappiness’.) The assumption is this: people prefer not to be unhappy. That is, if possible, they would like to move away from the state or situation of unhappiness. To the extent they formulate it in positive terms, as a move ‘towards’ something and not merely as a ‘move away’ from something, they would use words like ‘peace of mind’, ‘stability’, ‘acceptance’, ‘contentment’, ‘satisfaction’ and so on. (In Sanskrit, they could say that they seek ‘Shanti’, ‘Samaadhana’, ‘Trupti’, etc.) These are vague terms, of course, but that does not affect their desire to reach that state or have that feeling. If a ‘learned’ vocabulary is at your disposal, you might use words like ‘tranquillity’, ‘equanimity’ and such like. Generally speaking, achieving this (state or feeling) suffices for most people. This is the first issue.\nThe second issue is the reference framework, which is Indian. From within such a framework, regarding the previous point, one could say that in myriads of ways, Indian traditions try to help people reach this state: from pujas through discourses (‘pravachanas’) to meditations (dhyaana, japa).\nNow, some from among them want and seek more. They seek, let us say, Ananda (‘happiness’). This group is relatively small, compared to the total population. Despite their small number, Indian traditions cater to them too in myriads of ways. Let us divide these seekers of Ananda into two groups: those who seek knowledge of what they seek by imposing very strict conditions on what counts as knowledge; the others, who are not so demanding. Make no mistake: both seek Ananda and both also seek knowledge about it. One of them, only relative to the other, is extremely stringent. Such seekers are identified by Indian traditions as those who pursue the ‘gyaana marga’ (the ‘path of knowledge’) or do ‘gyaana yoga’. When used in a generic sense, this word picks out all such seekers; all of them are ‘gyaanis’; they are not ‘a-gyaanis’. However, the word means more to those who pursue the ‘path of knowledge’. (In what follows, your question will get picked up and dealt with from within this path.)\nIf so much is clear, then we can speak of enlightenment in these terms: those who seek Ananda seek ‘enlightenment’. What, then, is this Ananda that one seeks and how does one ‘find’ it? To those following the path of knowledge, these are also knowledge questions: what is the nature of what one seeks, how does one know that one has found it and how and why does what is accessed generate Ananda? These sub-questions indicate that, as the ‘knowledge-path’ sees it, one could find ‘ananda’ (i.e. one could be ‘happy’) without knowing what its nature is, how or why something brings forth Ananda. That is, one could be ‘enlightened’ without having ‘knowledge’ of the process of ‘enlightenment’. A bit more sharply: one could access the ‘Real’ without knowledge either about the Real or about how the Real relates to existence. In a generic sense, as said before, each person who accesses the Real is a gyaani; in terms of the knowledge path, that is not the case. There is a difference between those who access the Real and have knowledge of it and those who access the Real without such knowledge.\nIf this is the case, what happens to your question, when you ask, ‘is it possible to have knowledge of the Real?’ If that was not possible, gyaana marga or gyaana yoga could not exist or practicing such a path would not be possible. But the path exists; therefore, according to Indian traditions, knowledge of the Real is possible. Of course, the natural tendency would be to ask the question: what is the Real then? (This natural tendency requires to be addressed in a different way, which, hopefully, the third post will do.) For now, there is another issue of importance: how familiar is the above paragraph in the Indian traditions? Old hat, really, one would say. Consider, as a mere illustration, how the Gita draws the above distinction in the chapter on Gyaana Yoga, obviously. The reference is just to one shloka in the fourth chapter (4.34). Even there, let us just pick up the second verse of the shloka.\nIt begins thus: ‘Tadviddhi’, which compounds the words ‘tad’ and ‘viddhi’, meaning ‘Know (or learn or acquire knowledge of) that’. Know what? Skip now to the second verse. ‘Upadeshyanti Te Gyaanam’: ‘Knowledge will be taught to you’ (a rough translation). That means: what is taught to you is ‘knowledge’; this teaching will be in the form of ‘upadesha’ (‘discourse’, ‘sayings’, ‘instruction’) that fundamentally and necessarily makes use of language; learning or understanding this instruction requires the use ‘intellect’ and ‘mind’; that will lead you to ‘know’ (viddhi). The gyaana that you need to acquire will be taught as gyaana by using language. In short: if the knowledge of the Real is taught in language, the Real must be ‘graspable’ by human intellect and should be expressible in language. (The deleted sentence from your post, “The \u0026lsquo;Real\u0026rsquo; in (2), our traditions can point to but not express with tools of the mind”, would then not be true according to Gyaana Marga.)\nThe distinction is pretty obvious: ‘Tattva’ and ‘gyaana’ are distinguished; one is associated with ‘seeing’ and the other with ‘language’ and ‘learning’. Only those who have gyaana of tattva are called gyaanis, then.\nWho can do this teaching? ‘Gyaaninaha’: the ‘knowledgeable’. What makes them into ‘gyaanis’? What ‘knowledge’ do they have? Or what are they ’knowledgeable’ about? Or, better put, what should they know and what qualifies them to ‘teach’ knowledge? Well, they are ‘tattva darshinaha’: they have seen (darshina=to have seen, to see) ‘tattva’. ‘Tattva’ compounds two words: ‘Tat’ and ‘tva’, which mean ‘that’ and ‘-ness’. (‘Manushya-tva’ means ‘human-ness’, for instance.) ‘Tattva’ means ‘thatness’ here. The gyaanis’s are those who have gyaana of ‘thatness’ they have seen.\nIn the Gyaanamarga, therefore, the generic word ‘gyaani’ denotes a tattvadarshi; someone who has seen ‘thatness’, an ‘enlightened’. The Gyaani, however, has knowledge of tattva. Only this knowledge can be taught, not the tattva itself. Furthermore, it should be taught and learnt as ‘knowledge’, not in any other form. No knowledge of ‘tattva’ is possible without accessing it; accessing it alone is not enough because, without knowledge, it is just ‘thatness’ (even when it generates Ananda).\nNow, hopefully, you see how bullshit and enlightenment are linked to each other. One cannot talk about the Real without thought, language and reflection. Those who spoke of ‘Atman’; ‘Brahman’ etc. travelled the knowledge route. Even when you are not on this route, you only speak ‘knowledgably’ about it. However, because you do not have the required knowledge, the only thing you can produce are imitations or fakes. That is, all you have and can use are sentences (some ‘true’, yet others ‘false’). Then you are forced into presenting this set of sentences as ‘knowledge’ but hide this fact (that such a set is not knowledge) through sheer verbiage or many more sentences. This is what bullshit is, is it not? It trivializes knowledge by presenting it as a set of sentences. While it is true that Samasara is the only available route to Moksha, please do not forget that only moksha enables you to see that Samsara traps. In exactly the same way only knowledge enables you to see that even though true sentences are the route to knowledge (false sentences never are), they are traps as well. Truth, if seen as a property of sentences, does not liberate or free us. Unlike The Bible, the Gyaana Marga says that seeking truth (for its own sake) traps and enslaves. ‘Does Truth set us Free?’ It does not, it enslaves us. They are properties of ‘existence’ (i.e. they are sets of sentences or propositions). Existence is the route to the ‘Real’, to be sure; but if you focus on ‘existence’ for its own sake, you will be enslaved. Thus, those who present true sentences (whether as doctrines, or dogmas, or theories, or hypotheses, or models) as though that is knowledge simply bullshit. Please do not think that ‘falsehood’ frees us, when we say truth enslaves. No, only knowledge liberates. As knowledge about the falsity of a set of sentences can liberate, so can knowledge about their truth. In both cases, knowledge liberates, not truth. The ‘value’ of truth is derivative; truth is valuable, if and only if it leads us to knowledge. Samsara is valuable, if and only if it leads to moksha. Truth, not falsehood, is the route to knowledge, in the same way life but not death is the route to moksha.\nWhat has been said is enough to answer your question, ‘why do gyaani’s report that the Real is beyond intellectual reach?’ Three obvious, derivable answers: (a) they are tattva darshi’s; ‘gyaani’ is being used as a generic term here; (b) of course, unless ‘research’ is done into ‘thatness’, the darshana of ‘thatness’ remains beyond intellectual reach. Without ‘research’, the process cannot be understood. (c) a more interesting problem is this: our languages are languages of existence. It is very difficult to use a language of existence to talk about the Real, which is connected to but is itself neither existence nor non-existence. All three are non-ad hoc answers to your question. At the same time, it tells you how to begin distinguishing a ‘tattvadarshi’ from someone who is both a gyaani and a tattvadarshi, and separate these two from bullshitters. There is a clear distinction among the ‘enlightened’ themselves.\nFinally, a more rounded answer can be given to your questionnow. Yes, knowledge about the Real is possible and it can be taught as knowledge. Its acquisition, as with all knowledge, requires bending one’s back and learning. If you want to know Einstein’s theory of Relativity, you not only need some prior knowledge of physics and mathematics but also the ability to put in the effort to follow and understand the exposition. E-mail conversations might elucidate, but they cannot replace a deep and thorough-going study. This is the demand of all knowledge, not just of the Real.\nOne of the worries you express would disappear now. You say: “If it were possible to achieve this distinction intellectually, through thinking, logic or contemplation, the fruit of this exercise would belong in category (1) for it would still be a model or body of logic of some kind that \u0026rsquo;exists.\u0026rsquo;”. Indeed, as is the case, a product or a fruit of thinking is, say, a theory or a hypothesis or a model. As it is obvious from what has been said about ‘truth’ and ‘bullshit’, one should not claim that some or another theory, hypothesis or model is ‘Knowledge’. Even when we say that ‘science is knowledge’ (which I subscribe to), no one with any ‘knowledge’ of science suggests today that science=theories or hypotheses or models. A few decades ago, the project to define science as a set of theories completely collapsed; the last two heroic attempts were made by Wolfgang Stegmüller, who tried to use set theory to conceptualise science, and Jaakko Hintikka (and some of his students), who tried even less successfully to use logic of questions and versions of Game theory to think about science. Even though theories, questions and answers are crucial components, they are not identical with science or knowledge. Today, this is also well-known. (The Gita, in the same Shloka cited above, makes it abundantly clear that Indians knew this four thousand years ago.) In fact, as has already been said, calling a ‘theory’, or a ‘hypothesis’ or a ‘model’ (a set of true sentences) as ‘knowledge’ is to bullshit.\nzrp:le2\n","tags":[],"title":"Tattvadarshi, Gyaani, and Bullshitter","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/tattvadarshi-gyaani-and-bullshitter/"},{"categories":["Uncategorized"],"content":"For more, check this post: Freeing the Indian Traditions?

Here, then, is my invitation and the reason for extending it. (a) Are there people out there who are well-versed in Management theories (theory of firm, management control systems, organisational theory, etc) and sufficiently practical enough to undertake a medium to long-term research on the “relation between culture and management”? This research requires an intermeshing of the theories of organisation, my own studies on culture, and historical research into how public services were organised in India. Such research would help us develop an alternate “clustering structure”, as Arjun calls it. (b) If there are people out there well-versed in any of the above three areas and are willing to work along (either directly through participation or indirectly by facilitating others to undertake such a research), could you please get in touch with me off-line? We can have exchanges through the e-mail and we can meet up with each other sometime in April in the US to talk the concrete steps through. (I will be coming to the US in April.) (c) Such a research would enable us to develop not just an alternate description of India but also help evolving an alternate theory of organisation, which could get tested in practical life. (d) About my reason for extending the invitation. Not being a management specialist, it would take me at least a few years to become familiar with the extant theories about it. I simply do not have that time. I am willing, however, to work along and guide those who want to do research because I have *already* spent some time doing preliminary work on the subject. I am convinced that this is a gold-mine and I do believe that we will advance our understanding about the relation between culture and management (which every business manager confronts practically when he sets up business in India) in very interesting and concrete ways.

We have success stories. We have spiritual leaders; we have an extraordinarily organizational leader in front of us. And now I have to do an exam. You see, normally I take exams in the university. Now I have to do an exam. The exam is this I must move you from these wonderful stories, success stories, good stories, to a rather depressing story. The question is how can I do it and still catch your attention. I don\u0026rsquo;t know. After the exam, tell me please whether I\u0026rsquo;ve succeeded or failed.\nI want to talk about two dimensions, just dimensions, of problems that face us, our culture, our society, here in this country, and outside. In a way you know these problems but in a way I don\u0026rsquo;t think you quite appreciate the depth of the problem. I just want to take two aspects. You see we have heard we are facing the problem of proselytization, conversion of people. And I\u0026rsquo;ll focus only on one religion which I have studied for the last 40 years: Christianity. In some senses I would say that is not a serious problem at all, because this is important, there is a far more insidious problem, far more dangerous problem, far more poisonous problem which is the other face, the second face of the coin of proselytization, a conversion, and that is what I call secularization of Christianity.\nEver since the birth of Christianity, I won\u0026rsquo;t bother you with the history, there has been two faces to the expansion of Christianity: one is a well known conversion where people are converted into Christian religion, doctrine, and practices but there is the second which today is the dominant form of conversion, which is secularized translation of Christian ideas, which we all have accepted, I mean, every one of you has accepted in the name of science, modernity, rationality, and so on. This is secularization I will explain in the course of this talk with some examples. This is the first problem that confronts us; the second problem which has to do with 1000 years of colonialism, both Islamic and British, because of which we suffer, we all of us suffer, from what I call colonial consciousness. Now these two together, or in some senses perhaps the greatest challenges, facing us especially our children in the 21st century world.\nLet me take four examples and I\u0026rsquo;d like to say, when I give examples, I would be mentioning names but I have not been attacking the individuals. They are just to illustrate, that\u0026rsquo;s all. They are not to give evidence of my claim but just to illustrate what it is. You see, the British had what they call the civilizing mission of India, civilizing mission in the world. They wanted to civilize us. Let me just take two dimensions from that or four dimensions, perhaps four aspects if you like. The first is this: they found that we were an immoral people; we were a corrupt people. That\u0026rsquo;s one aspect, ethical dimension if you like, and they found that we were uncivilized and dominated by superstition. You know all this, you say why talk about it today. And see this is where colonial consciousness comes in. Because today in the 21st century India, we are reproducing all these four aspects with real credible power, as though the British had never left us.\nLet me take an example. The British found us extremely dirty people, unclean people. The civilizing mission was that the government should teach hygiene to Indians, the colonized subjects. Isn\u0026rsquo;t Swachh Bharat exactly that? Government teaching people how to be hygienic. What is the difference, if any, between Swachh Bharat and what British tried for 200 years to teach us cleanliness. Of course, our public toilets are very dirty; of course, our public offices are badly kept. But I\u0026rsquo;ll come back to it in a minute. But the point is the idea that it is a task of a government to teach hygiene to its people, is one of the civilizing missions, which the British carried out in India for hundreds of years and we are doing it very proudly today. One dimension.\nSecond dimension: the British found us incapable of ruling ourselves. They found us corrupt; they found us immoral; they found that we did not deserve the independence that we got, even though they are forced to give under pressure. Have situations changed? Today we all believe, most of us at least, that most politicians are corrupt. Maybe they are; maybe they aren\u0026rsquo;t. We found a party, Aam Admi party, to remove corruption from Indian administration and Indian politics. A section of us vote for them and I\u0026rsquo;m told 20%. We are convinced, when you go to Patrol bunk that you will be cheated in the sense you won\u0026rsquo;t get a full patrol. When you give a car for servicing or smartphones for repairing under warranty, we are afraid that they won\u0026rsquo;t do it properly and cheat us. We say, in the words of my brother, ham sab log chor hain, ham sab log chor hain *(trans. we are all thieves, we are all thieves).*We talk that way in the streets, every day about ourselves. Tell me how are we today different from what the British thought about us. This is one aspect.\nSecond aspect. Francis Xavier, the famous patron saint of the Catholics, wrote to the Emperor of Portugal: your excellency, he said, the only thing needed today to make go up here is to kill all the brahmins. The British and the Europeans came and told us that the Indian society, its religion \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo;, is backed by the most corrupt system known to humankind called \u0026rsquo;the caste system\u0026rsquo;. Ambedkarites in Karnataka in 70\u0026rsquo;s\u0026mdash;it went on for more than a decade\u0026mdash;went to the University classrooms, picked up Brahmin girls, raped them in the quadrangle and send them back to the class. Anybody who protests is beaten to death; today, the same Ambedkarites every week go to the university colleges and tell hundreds of children, the young people coming from the villages, that Brahmins have to be killed and the best thing is to rape their women. You go to Bishop Cottons High School in the streets of Bangalore , you\u0026rsquo;d find written on the walls, all brahmins must be killed and they find exactly what the British found us, what the European found us: the caste system and Brahminism destroying India.\nHow different are we from the British? Today, in fact, the extraordinary thing is none of these facts are untrue as I said; there is, so to speak, corruption, but the question is, what kind of corruption is it? We all say, politicians are corrupt, but do you know what it means to speak about corruption and why public officials should not be corrupt. We talk about \u0026lsquo;public interest\u0026rsquo;. They are not defending \u0026rsquo;the public interest\u0026rsquo;, but do we really know what \u0026lsquo;public interest\u0026rsquo; means even if they put public interest litigation (PIL) in the court? Do we have words for it? \u0026lsquo;svaartha\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;paraartha\u0026rsquo; don\u0026rsquo;t translate it. \u0026lsquo;hitaasakti\u0026rsquo; doesn\u0026rsquo;t translate it. But we say, politicians should not be because they\u0026rsquo;re serving the \u0026lsquo;public interest\u0026rsquo; and we don\u0026rsquo;t even know what \u0026lsquo;public interest\u0026rsquo; means. As I said, it is true , our institutions, public institutions like toilets etc, are filthy and unkempt. But does that mean that Indians are dirty, we need Swachh Bharat?\nIt is true that one jaati oppresses another jaati in different parts of India, different parts of the society. Does it mean, therefore, we have caste system? You may say, \u0026lsquo;yes\u0026rsquo;, but then I wanted you to reflect on one thing: the Sun we see moving on the horizon every day, does it, therefore, mean that the Sun is revolving around the earth? In exactly the same way and \u0026hellip; It\u0026rsquo;s true, we face some facts, we see some facts, but the theories we are using to understand these facts, are secularized Christian variants which make our culture, our people, our society immoral, corrupt, backward, and primitive.\nChairman sir, ladies, and gentlemen, the challenge facing us is simply this: where is that independence that is supposed to have had?\nComments Alka Shastry — 2018-05-09 03:25:00\nThere is a slight mistake in dating- the incidents in Karnataka referred to here were in 1960\u0026rsquo;s and 70\u0026rsquo;s.

It is used to speak of \u0026ldquo;the temple of Solomon\u0026rdquo; (the king Solomon of the Jews) too and there is no suggestion in the western culture that the Jews worshipped false gods.\nYour friend is providing you with an identifying description: \u0026ldquo;this building which\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; and identifies it in terms of several functions tied to that building.\nIf your friend is not arguing for the sake of arguing, then ask him the following types of questions: what distinguishes an Anjaneya\u0026rsquo;s temple from a Siva\u0026rsquo;s temple and these two from Rama\u0026rsquo;s temple or that of a Sharadamba? Why do they not do puja\u0026rsquo;s in Siva\u0026rsquo;s temple by chanting the Vishnu Sahasranama? Etc. If he knows something at all about the Indian traditions (irrespective of what language he speaks in), your friend will to say something about the nature of the Devas and the Devatas in these temples.\nAsk your friend too, provided he is genuine about \u0026lsquo;understanding\u0026rsquo;, why the Bhakta\u0026rsquo;s of Anjaneya are strict celibates. Ask your friend further why no sculptures of naked women are found anywhere in the temple murals of Anjaneya, and why prostitutes do not throng his temple, if all temples were brothels.\nQuestions of the type (3) and (4) will help you primarily (and your friend secondarily) to figure out how your friend is using the word \u0026rsquo;temple\u0026rsquo;. This use will be partly governed by his rootedness in some tradition or another. Before you give your definitions of words (which you are free to do anytime you feel like), try to find out how your friend is using them, if you intend to communicate with him.\nThe problem is not one of whether the Indians provide words with their own \u0026lsquo;meanings\u0026rsquo;, which differ from how Oxford English Dictionary defines them. Even less does it have to do with wanting to be \u0026lsquo;fair\u0026rsquo; to speakers from different cultures and the \u0026lsquo;meanings\u0026rsquo; they give to words in the English language. There are two kinds of issues: one is about what words like \u0026lsquo;God\u0026rsquo;, \u0026rsquo;temple\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;sacredness\u0026rsquo;, etc. mean in English or in any West-European language; the other, because of this, is about communicability and research.\nIf you had read \u0026lsquo;The Heathen \u0026hellip;\u0026rsquo; you would have known that words like the above are theoretical terms in the Christian theology. As such, they have found their home also in the natural languages of Europe. Therefore, when one talks about the phenomenon of religion, one uses these terms in a rather precise way (even in the European natural languages). When we talk about \u0026lsquo;atoms\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;genes\u0026rsquo; in English, we make use of a part of their technical meanings from scientific theories. Now one of your rhetorical question boils down to this: why cannot Indians mean \u0026lsquo;haircut\u0026rsquo; while using the word \u0026lsquo;atoms\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;Masala Dosa\u0026rsquo; when they use the words \u0026lsquo;genes\u0026rsquo;? They can; they have the freedom to do so. However, if they do so with others who follow the technical meanings of these words (as defined in these theories) even partially, the Indians run the risk of being radically incoherent or downright stupid. This is not an issue of \u0026lsquo;fairness\u0026rsquo;.\nMy thesis about colonial consciousness supplements the claim I put forward in \u0026lsquo;The Heathen\u0026hellip;\u0026rsquo; about religious language being its own meta-language. Indians think they are \u0026lsquo;free\u0026rsquo; to mean \u0026lsquo;puja\u0026rsquo; when they use the word \u0026lsquo;worship\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;pavitra\u0026rsquo; when they use the word \u0026lsquo;sacredness\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;holy\u0026rsquo; (they probably use these two words as synonyms) and so on. While indeed they are not wrong in assuming that they do have this freedom, they make perfect asses of themselves when they discuss with literate people or write books using \u0026rsquo;their\u0026rsquo; meanings. They do so, however, in the a) conviction that they do know what these words \u0026lsquo;mean\u0026rsquo;; (b) oblivious to their own total ignorance in theology; (c) certain that their \u0026lsquo;meanings\u0026rsquo; is all there is to these words. This is a wide-spread social phenomenon in India and it is just about as normal as someone writing a paper in Physics or Biology with the conviction that \u0026lsquo;atoms\u0026rsquo; mean \u0026lsquo;haircut\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;genes\u0026rsquo; mean \u0026lsquo;Masala Dosa\u0026rsquo;.

Thus the contrast Gita is making is this: if you remain the way you are born without doing any further effort, then you are a paapayoni; if you put in the effort to grow, then you are a punyayoni. To make sure that people would understand this distinction, gita speaks about shudra and stree (two natural properties) and brahamana and rajarshi (two acquired properties).

In and of itself, not such a big problem if it is not for a cognitive tendency that is dominant in the ‘social sciences’, which brings me to the second point.\n(b) Often, names supplant the search for explanations by ending up as one. It is like saying that ‘patriotism’ causes one to fight for one’s country.

To say that Indian culture is \u0026lsquo;pluralist\u0026rsquo; and that is why this happens is the wrong answer: it is like saying that Opium induces sleep because it has sleep-inducing properties (Virtus Dormitiva as the good doctor put it in Moliére\u0026rsquo;s play from which I borrow this example).

You could, if you so choose, name this phenomenon as “patriotism” or “jihad” or just “territorial behavior”. None of the three terms render the phenomenon intelligible; they merely baptize it. At times, it does appear as though these terms do explain, because arguments and reasoning are brought in, motivations are adduced, etc. But none of these is explanatory in nature: considerations are provided to classify this event as an instance of that phenomenon; they do not explain why that comes about at all. “Patriotism” is not the cause/reason for fighting for one’s country, ‘fighting for one’s country’ is called patriotism. (p. 53 of \u0026lsquo;We shall not cease \u0026hellip;\u0026rsquo;\nYet Another example: why do babies have their fists clenched almost all the time?

A Sikh boy and a Muslim girl enroll. They wear the colors of the school, including the right colored turban (or, if the Sikh kid is too young, his hair tied up in a knot) and the right-colored head scarf. From what I know of the Indian schools, most schools (including the fellow-students) would let the situation stand. Assume that some school makes an issue about this. The parents do not have many choices: either the Sikh family shaves the boy (unlikely), or step to the courts (more likely today than yesterday) or look for another school (most likely) if persuading the school authorities fails. If we look at the tolerance of the school authorities, it appears to me that the following can be said: in all probability, it does not occur to them that, in keeping the turban or the head scarf on, the kids are marking themselves off or that there is discrimination involved in allowing this. The question is: how do they look at the turban (or the tied knot of hair) or at the scarf?\nTo the extent they insist that the colors of these headgears also reflect the colors of the school, only to that extent are they looking at them as dresses. Where they do not make even this into an issue, there, I suspect, something more than a \u0026ldquo;pagan indifference\u0026rdquo; is at play. In such cases, people do not see either the turban (or the knot) or the scarf as part of the dress code. That is, they are not indifferent to what these students wear or how they look (including how the hair has to be trimmed); instead, I think, they do not see either the turban (or the knot of hair) or the head scarf as dresses. To them, it has the same status as the different coloured bindis or the kaajal that other girls wear. Neither of these two is seen to belong to the dresses: instead, it is seen as an expression of a way of life. The school does not have the authority to interfere with the way students choose to express their tradition, so long as the latter indicate that, in doing so, they are not rebelling against the rules of the school. (This attitude tells us something about how most Indians have understood the notion of a \u0026ldquo;neutral\u0026rdquo; sphere: one that does not interfere with the expressions of traditions. This issue will have to be left aside for the moment.) The life at the school is continuous with the life one leads outside its precincts.\nIf this sketch is even approximately true, we need to notice two things here. (a) Some apparels are not seen as parts of the dress code because one knows that they are more than that; (b) the lives that children lead elsewhere is continuous with the lives at school. The first is a result of knowing that the turbans (or a hair knot) and scarves are deemed important by those who wear them even if one does not know what their importance is. In short, what most Indian schools do is the following: they are not indifferent (in any sense of the term) to what their students wear (that is why they have uniforms) but they are willing to consider these headgears as more than being mere pieces of clothing (for those involved). They do not see the need to (or feel incapable of) change the ways of life of their students: education, then, does not involve creating a gulf between their daily lives and their lives at school. In some senses, this attitude stands to reason: education should help you live your life better and you do not teach them this by creating a separate bubble.\nThe recurring element in the present discussion involves treating headscarves primarily as part of dresses to which some or another significance is tagged on secondarily. Divya sees it, primarily as an expression of a way of life and only secondarily as a dress code. She sees it as an expression of the subordination of women (or something akin to that) and hence her instinctive responses. Whether she is right or wrong in her perception, the point remains: she sees it the way headscarves are part of the lives of (at least some) Muslim women. As against this, you have the western way of formulating the issue: headscarf is on par with other pieces of clothing (much like, say, the other parts of the uniforms that the school children wear). Hence the discussion about the dress codes that we have had on the forum.\nHowever, the terms of the debate are set by the so-called secular thinkers: the school (or the premises of a government organization) is a neutral territory of some sort and that one should not wear pieces of clothing that also have a primary religious or symbolic significance. Jakob denies the first argument on the grounds that we cannot postulate a well-founded division between the secular and the religious. His advocacy of pagan indifference, to the extent it is formulated as an indifference to pieces of clothing, however, accepts the secular framing of the issue: headscarf is a piece of clothing (for both us and the Muslims), while also being \u0026ldquo;something else\u0026rdquo;. The difference between Divya and others can be formulated thus: is the headscarf a piece of clothing besides also being a symbol, or is it a symbol besides also being a piece of clothing?\nIf it is also a piece of clothing (the position that Divya is assuming) and it is that only secondarily, then a school in the West can allow students to wear headscarves on condition that they also reflect the colors of the school. However, if it is primarily seen as a piece of clothing, then a school in the West cannot but forbid such a violation. How can a school (in the West) defend the first position, while denying any and every arbitrary statement that \u0026ldquo;non-conformists\u0026rdquo; want to make? It could consider them as religious symbols and, furthermore, also accept that different groups within the same religion have chosen to express their commitment to their practices in different ways. One cannot go to Koran or look at how the Palestinian women wore headscarves in the seventeenth-century in order to settle the issue of how some Muslim women should or should not wear headscarves.\nThis is where the problem emerges: in line with its treatment of religion as a human product, the western secular thinking reduces the wearing of headscarves and such like to human conventions. At best, it is a matter of etiquette; at worst, it is openly religious. Both are forbidden in the secular space: in the best case by invoking the dress code of the school and in the worst case by invoking the mantra of a secular sphere.\nDivya might be wrong or right in seeing the degradation of women in hijab. However, she is not wrong when she says that an important issue is being overlooked, namely, that we know that it has some or another primary significance. To a large extent, I think, her responses could be traced back to this issue.\nComments DecisivePoet131 — 2018-02-07 10:07:00\nI don\u0026rsquo;t think we ought to talk about hijabs and turbans as entities that represent the same or even similar phenomenon.\nOne stands for a well defined, truth based religious system that claim its truth value (against what? the falsity of every other belief system/tradition/culture of course!) while the other merely stands for a cultural identity of a finite sect of people.\nOne truly believes we ALL come from the lineage of Abraham, Issac, Joseph and Mohammed, and ought to see this as something obvious; while the other merely belongs to a small sect of people that neither make a universal claim, nor intelligently try to appropriate the multiple cultures and traditions of the world into the common history of mankind.\nI try not to make statements that generalize human emotions as that can be very messy, but if I had to guess, going off the \u0026ldquo;revelation\u0026rdquo; of the one \u0026ldquo;true God\u0026rdquo;: the wearer of the hijab looks at every non-hijab person as a heretic condemned to eternal damnation;whereas if I had to sum up the emotions experienced by a Sikh on encountering a non-Sikh, it is one of STARK indifference.\nThe fundamental problem here is the fact that secularism and secular thought as seen by the west was formed under the loving and warm embrace of Semitic thought, which boldly claims every human tradition is a religion (although a \u0026lsquo;false\u0026rsquo; one!). Where the west sees only religion, us Indians see only traditions. I guess that is what Sir Kipling was referring to when he spoke about the blindness of us Heathens.\n","tags":[],"title":"Hijabs, Turbans and the Secular","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/hijabs-turbans-and-the-secular-state/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","secular"],"content":" We can all accept the fact, I suppose, that some thing or another is a religious symbol to someone when s/he belongs to that religion whose symbol it is. In this sense, the Cross (for a long period of time), the figure of the Prophet Mohammed (also for a long period of time) and the star of David (in the course of this century) are symbols that carry religious significance to the Christians, Muslims and the Jews respectively. We are also agreed, I suppose, that there is no way of characterizing any of these as religious symbols in a religiously neutral way.\nThere is another issue. All of us know the following as well: we know that the Cross, the figure of the prophet, the star of David are religious symbols to some groups of people. We know that they are religious symbols (to some people) even when we do know that there is no neutral theory that makes them religious symbols (to all). That is to say: even though the Cross is no religious symbol to me, I do know that it is one for a Christian. Question: what do I do about it? Do I act as though I am not appraised of this fact and piss on a Cross (in front of a Christian) or do I act in a reverential way towards it as well? That is, how do I relate to this other tradition that Christianity is (even when I am not a Christian and consider Christianity as a religion)? To what extent do I recognize the practices and symbols of other traditions as things that are as important to these traditions as my practices and symbols are to me?\nOne cannot argue that in order to recognize this parallel, I need some or another theory about what tradition is, what symbols to a tradition are, and how we can differentiate between traditions, and so on. Learning to be part of a tradition includes learning to relate to other traditions as well. In this sense, even if we do not know (or have a theory) about dress codes and such like, we do know that hijab, burkha etc are dresses approved (and, on some accounts, compulsory) by and within a religion and that they do connote certain attitudes, values, and so on. One cannot feign ignorance about this piece of knowledge and act in an indifferent way towards this issue of women wearing hijab, burkha and so on. Of course, we might just know that Muslim women wear these dresses (through acquaintance with their dressing habits) and know no more than this. Then, and only then, could we reasonably say \u0026ldquo;Oh, Muslim women wear Burkhas the way Indian women wear Saris\u0026rdquo;, and leave it at that. But if know more than this, then our indifference would take on the form that (rightly, I think) angers or irritates some. Suppose that the burkha does signify that women are creatures of a lower order than men. And also that we know this. Then, I do not quite see how one could swallow this and still believe that differences between men and women does not imply asymmetry between these two sexes.\nThere is no one particular reason why the Indian women wear Saris or do not wear them. The question is: is this also true of hijabs and burkhas? All I can say is that I have heard of at least three different reasons: 1. It is an expression of the lower status of women in Islam; 2. It is religiously mandatory; 3.people would like to affirm their so-called religious identity. Recently, a fourth response has emerged: 4. an act of defiance born out of a perceived injustice against the Muslims.\nI really do not think that it is possible to appeal to the notion of \u0026ldquo;pagan indifference\u0026rdquo; in the presence of information about symbols that have significance to other religions. In this sense, by appealing to the impossibility of providing a neutral notion of religious symbols or whatever is to evade the issue. Nor could we suggest that the western states adopt the attitude of \u0026ldquo;the pagans\u0026rdquo;. The western state is hostile to religion and this hostility is religious in nature. I think a more fruitful way of challenging the western secular state is to show that there exist no reasonable grounds for it to be unremittingly hostile to either religion (in general) or to religious practices (in general). That is, show that the hostile opposition between the secular and the religious does not have any reasonable grounds. Of course, this does not prevent the state from being hostile to specific religious practices in the public realm. However, such a hostility cannot be reasonably extended and generalized. Consequently, we have to ask the question: has the western state made a reasonable case against Muslim women wearing headscarves? Or, does it simply rely on the tired repetition of the mantra about the religious-secular divide?\n","tags":[],"title":"Secular State and Hijab","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/secular-state-and-hijab/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","religion","world view","explanatorily intelligible"],"content":" It would be interesting to answer the question of whether or not The Lord of the Rings (LOTR) is a religious story by testing against \u0026lsquo;religion is an explanatorily intelligible account of the Cosmos\u0026rsquo;. Does the Lord of the Rings give an account in which the causal and intentional explanations for the happenings in Middle Earth fall together?\nOne of the problems in testing a scientific theory and of developing one, I might add, is to ask the right question. The other problem, of course, is to find the right answer. Let us first take a step back and look at the claim.\nWhat could make The LOTR into a Christian story? There is no Christ, no God, no revelation, nothing about the fulfilling of God\u0026rsquo;s promise to the Children of Israel (there is no Israel), no Pope or priest, no original sin or the Garden of Eden, and so on. So, how could anyone claim that the story of the Middle Earth is a \u0026lsquo;recognizably\u0026rsquo; Christian story?\nThere is one way of justifying such a claim, however. Take some or another Biblical theme, dress it in another set of ideational clothes, and tell the story further. However, according to the dominant consensus, such a story would be \u0026lsquo;secular\u0026rsquo; and, as one never tires of assuring, the \u0026lsquo;secular\u0026rsquo; is the other of the \u0026lsquo;religious\u0026rsquo;. Thus, if one follows the consensus in the field of religious studies, the secular story that The LOTR is, could never be a religious story.\nIf you accept the claims made in \u0026lsquo;The Heathen.\u0026rsquo;, you face no problems when confronting the \u0026lsquo;secular\u0026rsquo; world; it is a secularized religious world. You know this is the dynamic of religion; you know that the Christological dilemma is the motor in the spreading of a de-Christianized Christianity. Thus, you are prepared for the possibility (and even the necessity) of religious (or Christian) themes being dressed up as \u0026lsquo;secular\u0026rsquo; ones.\nDoes it mean that The LOTR is an EI account? When you ask this question, bear in mind that even the Bible (as a story) can become an EI account only if you accept it as the Revelation of God. If you do not, then the Bible is a mere book and does not become an EI account. Instead, it ends up being viciously circular: the Bible is the revelation of God\u0026rsquo;s Will because it \u0026lsquo;says\u0026rsquo; that it is such a revelation.\nLet us assume that someone believes The LOTR is a true story about the Earth. Does that make The LOTR into a religion? The answer is at par with the question: what if I believe in the truth of Sherlock Holmes? You can form an association, collect curiosa, meet regularly, dress differently, etc. Believing in the truth of a story is not enough to transform a story into a religion. In short, The LOTR might be considered a \u0026lsquo;religious\u0026rsquo; story to the extent it secularizes a religious story.\nI would like to draw your attention to a fact I have repeated many times. Religion is self-reflexive: what it is includes what it says about itself. Religion as an EI account of itself and the Cosmos captures this self-reflexivity. To investigate any further into religion at that level of description is to do theology. That is why I shift the level of study in the tenth chapter to look at religion as a worldview. Even this creates problems for doing a scientific study of religion. Hence, in the eleventh chapter, I look at religion as an entity that generates a configuration of learning. This enables us to study some aspects of religion scientifically without having to do theology.\nHowever, keep in mind that besides generating a configuration of learning, religion is also a worldview and is primarily an EI account. As such, there is no way of using any piece of human knowledge (whether Logic or Physics) to \u0026rsquo;explain\u0026rsquo; this EI account further without being a believer. You could also formulate the nature of my hypothesis in Chapter 9 in this way: it is the best \u0026rsquo;theological\u0026rsquo; account of what religion is. To elaborate further on this hypothesis is to do \u0026lsquo;scientific\u0026rsquo; theology (as though such a label is not a contradiction in terms!).\nOne of the virtues of \u0026lsquo;The Heathen\u0026hellip;\u0026rsquo; is that it shows why the above is the case. Chapters Nine and Ten, together, tell us in scientific terms why the further use of the notions of an EI account and Worldview forces us to do theology. In chapter Eleven, I lay the groundwork for a scientific study of religion.\nIn other words, do not get stuck at the level of an EI account. Two more chapters come after the ninth chapter. EI account is my hypothesis about religion, it is true, but because religion includes what it says about itself, we cannot build further on that hypothesis.\n","tags":[],"title":"Self-reflexivity of Religion","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/self-reflexivity-of-religion/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","basics","erudition"],"content":"I keep teaching my students the need to unlearn: unlearn the desire to \u0026lsquo;show off\u0026rsquo; their erudition; unlearn shallowness and so on. I am more than convinced that whatever we have learnt about human beings can be formulated in a jargon-free language and in a simple manner. There is no need to appear \u0026lsquo;mysterious and profound\u0026rsquo;; nor is there a need for exhibiting one\u0026rsquo;s erudition or \u0026lsquo;critical capacities\u0026rsquo;. On all these counts, most of Foucalt\u0026rsquo;s writings (and that of his commentators) can only call forth anger and irritation.\nIt is my belief that everyone of us (whatever our specializations) are capable of contributing to the research programme. The nature and kind of their contributions (whether they write books and/or articles in scientific journals) depends on many factors, including, only partially, their knowledge of the domain. (However, keep in mind that many fundamental scientific revolutions have required rank ‘outsiders’ to make the breakthroughs.) What we need (I would almost say, almost the only thing we need) is a willingness and ability to think about our experiences. In what language we do it, what our terminologies are, what our background knowledge is, etc. determine the form of our contribution, no doubt, but not its content.\nIn some senses, I would say, your doubts zero-in on the real problem: we believe we need some specialized theories to formulate our problems. But such theories do not exist. Guided by the belief that there are such theories, we take recourse to jargon, use bloated terminologies, appeal to fads and fashion to say simple things. In that process, we end up completely losing track of what we wanted to say or the insights we are trying to express.\nThe research programme seeks something very, very simple: to reflect on our experiences. Our public is people like you and me, not as specialists but as ordinary human beings. Let us write to each other and begin a process of thinking. There are no ‘outsiders’ in this process: you are as qualified as I am. The only difference between you and me is the time we spend doing that and the expertise we bring to bear in formulating our insights.\nI asked you to read Popper to help you get rid of some confusions that arise because of the pseudo-philosophy we have absorbed in our lives.

The \u0026lsquo;how\u0026rsquo; of it must be obvious: the \u0026rsquo;this\u0026rsquo; is an indexical. Consequently, any person can hold both these beliefs together (at the same time or about the same route) without being contradictory (depending upon what he points out using the word \u0026rsquo;this\u0026rsquo;). In fact, even statements like (c) \u0026ldquo;Route 19 is the only way to Bombay\u0026rdquo; and (d) \u0026ldquo;Route 24 is one of the ways to Bombay\u0026rdquo; can be held to be true by one and the same person at the same time without fear of contradiction. ( Both statements would be true if Route 24 allows one to join Route 19 at some point or the other.) In other words, Minimus, your examples do not work the way you want them to.

It cannot have anything to do with the act of comparing itself: one can compare any thing to anything else. It cannot have anything to do with the objects of comparison: after all, both things are beliefs. It cannot have anything to do with the fact that the objects of these beliefs are different: two different beliefs are different from each other because the objects of beliefs are different in some way or another.

There is a reason for this request. For some time, I too thought that the ‘Indian caste system’ was an abomination. In order to find out where it came from, the nature of its foundations, and the causes for its continued reproduction, I started reading and researching into the question. Normally, research renders the questions sharper, but in this case the subject became vaguer! The more I read, the more confusing it all became: everyone seemed to be against the caste system (with a few exceptions) but no one seemed to know what it was! While each had very clear moral opinions on the subject, none had any clear understanding of what they were for/against. Consequently, my request: in your article, please (1) do not assume that the caste system is an evil, but show that it is; (2) do not just say it is obviousthat it is a bane, but demonstrate it; (3) do not just affirm that ‘the dalits’ are victims of an immoral and unjust social organisation, but show how and why they are that. So far, I have not been able to prove any of the above claims scientifically (or even unscientifically). Everyone seems to assume it, and the (literally) thousands of books and articles I have read on this score fail miserably in even saying what ‘the caste system’ is, leave alone prove that it is the cause of many social and cultural ills in our culture and society. May I look forward to something that at least provides me with a semblance of a proof?\n","tags":[],"title":"Central features of studies on Caste","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/central-features-of-studies-on-caste/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","puja","translation","worship"],"content":" Firstly, you want to know whether there is anything intrinsically wrong with performing idol worship the way it is with robbery. Let us assume that we agree we know what robbery is and that it is intrinsically wrong. We need to make these assumptions because (a) in all probability, the robbers do not see anything intrinsically wrong in the act of robbing; (b) even then, some of us might not be willing to call a \u0026lsquo;Robin hood\u0026rsquo; (who robs only the rich and passes on the spoils to the poor, retaining a modest \u0026lsquo;commission\u0026rsquo; for himself and fellow robbers) an immoral person; (c) to most of us, it is unclear whether the windfall profits that oil corporations have made in the last years constitute robbery or not and so on. Under these assumptions, you are drawing an analogy between idol worship and an act that a human being performs with respect to fellow-human beings. This analogy breaks down because idol worship is not a relation between human beings but between a particular act of a human being (called \u0026lsquo;worship\u0026rsquo;) and the entity worshipped.\nHowever, one can look at morality as obedience to God\u0026rsquo;s will (that is, look at moral laws as His commandments). If you look at it this way, then, yes, idol worship is intrinsically wrong because, in doing so, one disobeys God\u0026rsquo;s will. (\u0026lsquo;Immorality\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;sin\u0026rsquo; is disobeying God\u0026rsquo;s will and God has explicitly forbidden worshipping Him in this way.) Not only has God forbidden idol worship but He has also revealed how he should be worshipped. (Each Semitic religion tells its own story about the \u0026lsquo;how\u0026rsquo; of worship.) You might want to argue that no harmful consequences follow from idol worship. If you do, you would be wrong: through false worship, you condemn yourself to damnation for all eternity. This is the fundamental freedom that God has given to human beings: to choose between Him, the possibility of salvation and eternal life on the one hand and the false gods (the Devil and his legions), false worship and eternal damnation on the other. In this sense, idol worship has very clear meaning and reference. This is a concept in the theologies of the Semitic religions.\nYou can also look at this concept, strip it of all its meaning and reference, and use an empty word in the English language that refers to the Indian act of doing puja, say, in a temple. You might use the English word worship' to refer to the act of doing 'puja' or even to 'upaasana'. Further, 'murthi' or 'vigraha' can be replaced by the word idol\u0026rsquo;. Furthermore, you can use the word \u0026lsquo;paapa\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;mahaapaapa\u0026rsquo; in place of \u0026lsquo;sin\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;immorality\u0026rsquo;. Now the question about idol worship becomes: \u0026lsquo;is murthi pooja a mahapaapa?\u0026rsquo; Because of the replacement affected, you can also ask \u0026lsquo;Is idol worship a sin?\u0026rsquo; Notice, however, what you have done. You presuppose that your audience is at home with the Indian practices, thus knows what you are talking about, and can understand this account of the Indian practices. Now, the question is this: are you talking in the English language or not? Even though you use English words, you are not talking in the English language. Any string of empty syllables could do the same job these English words are doing in this context. Suppose that I say \u0026lsquo;pooja\u0026rsquo; (or \u0026lsquo;Upaasana\u0026rsquo;) should be replaced by \u0026lsquo;pif\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;paapa\u0026rsquo; (or mahaappapa) by \u0026lsquo;paf\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;idol\u0026rsquo; by \u0026lsquo;poof\u0026rsquo;, I get exactly the same result: Is poof-pif also a paf?\nThe illusion that you are saying and doing something else, and that they are intelligible, arises from our history. We are taught that \u0026lsquo;pooja\u0026rsquo; is \u0026ldquo;translated\u0026rdquo; as \u0026lsquo;worship\u0026rsquo;, \u0026ldquo;murthi\u0026rdquo; as \u0026lsquo;Idol\u0026rsquo;, \u0026ldquo;paapa\u0026rdquo; as \u0026lsquo;sin\u0026rsquo; (or as \u0026ldquo;immoral\u0026rdquo;). Note though that, in the act of translation, one is establishing some kind of \u0026ldquo;equivalence\u0026rdquo; in the meaning of these words. That is why we speak of translation and not of arbitrary replacement of some words with other words (the way I did in the above paragraph). Those who undertook these translations did believe that the Indians worshipped idols, cows, the penis and so on. They established these \u0026lsquo;conventions\u0026rsquo; and none of the Indian intellectuals (whether of yesteryears or contemporaneous) protested: they continued and sustained these conventions. For some reason or the other, all such intellectuals genuinely believe that they \u0026lsquo;understand\u0026rsquo; the meaning and reference of these words in the English language. The problem does not lie in their lack of \u0026lsquo;understanding\u0026rsquo; of the English language but in their lack of understanding of the western culture. We have no clue about the extent to which theologies (which are theories) have made a home for themselves in linguistic practice.\nThis problem of not understanding the western culture while genuinely believing that one does is compounded by something else. One tries to account for (and thus understand) religions like Christianity using our intellectual frameworks. While it stands to reason that we try to understand another culture within the framework of our own, our abysmal ignorance of the West creates formidable problems of its own. We look at the Semitic religions as human expressions and human creations. In this framework, we cannot even begin to understand what they say about themselves, viz. they are not human creations but the revelations of God. (I have even read people writing that \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; also has the \u0026lsquo;concept\u0026rsquo; of revelation: \u0026lsquo;apaurusheya\u0026rsquo; and that the \u0026lsquo;veda\u0026rsquo; is the \u0026lsquo;revelation\u0026rsquo; of \u0026lsquo;God\u0026rsquo;.) As much as the Semitic religions did not understand Indian traditions, we do not understand the former: that is the \u0026lsquo;blindness\u0026rsquo; of the heathen that I talk about. In fact, we fail to see religions but see human traditions everywhere instead. There is something defensible and indefensible in this attempt. The former when we try to understand religions; the latter when we do so without learning anything about them in the first place. Therefore, I would warn you to be careful when you use notions like \u0026lsquo;asad upaasana\u0026rsquo; and such like to understand the notion of idol worship. They belong to totally different levels and refer to different kinds of phenomena. If you use one to talk of the other, you will end up understanding neither.\nFinally, I would like to draw your attention to our language-use. I do not know when \u0026lsquo;murthi puja\u0026rsquo; was coined. But I do vaguely remember reading that Raja Ram Mohun Roy gave wide currency to this word by saying that it was a \u0026lsquo;mahaapaapa\u0026rsquo;. While writing this post, it struck me that the way I use this word (and I remember others using it in the same way) is very nuanced. Rarely, if ever, do we say that we did puja to the muthi of Ganesha, when we go to the temples: we say that we did puja to Ganesha. Hardly, if ever, do we use \u0026lsquo;vigraha\u0026rsquo; in this context. When we use words like murthi or vigraha, we refer to statues: \u0026lsquo;In Bombay, (we say while referring to the Ganesha procession), the murthi was 50 feet long\u0026rsquo;; \u0026lsquo;in this or that temple, the vigraha is very pretty\u0026rsquo; and so on. That is to say, we use these words only when we refer to human creations and the physical objects. I hardly recollect anyone saying that \u0026lsquo;I did puja to the Ganesha murthi in that temple\u0026rsquo;. They say, instead that they did puja to Ganesha in that temple. If this recollection of mine is also true of how we normally use these words, then, it appears that we hardly speak of \u0026lsquo;murthi puja\u0026rsquo;, let alone doing it. The question \u0026rsquo;to whom did you do puja to?\u0026rsquo; rarely, if ever, elicits the answer: \u0026lsquo;I did puja to the murthi of Ganesha in that temple\u0026rsquo;.

Something, let us call it ‘daffodil’, fascinates us. Let us also assume that a great deal of concern and interest is expressed about it. Consider two scenarios now, each of which testifies to our fascination.\nThe first scenario is this. There is versification (call it ‘poetry’) and ‘embodiment’ (paintings and sculptures) of ‘daffodil’; imaginative eulogies (novels) and intimidating discourses (‘philosophy’) about ‘daffodil’ abound, etc. These classifications are based on our understanding of what art, poetry, philosophy etc. are. There are also many collations of fragmentary sentences that appear to violate metres of poetry or styles of prose. They are revered as revolutionary breakthroughs (made by the heroes of the ‘masses’ transgressing such elitist notions like ‘grammar’, ‘style’, etc.) that are ‘blinding in their beauty’. In short, there is a huge collection of material about ‘daffodil’.\nThe second scenario merely adds the following group to it: knowledge about the ‘daffodil’. That is, there are books about flowers, including the ‘daffodil’, manuals about growing and gardening it, ideas about top-soil, environment and manure required to grow it, etc. Because of this, the above scenario gets transformed: the nature of the earlier classification itself changes dramatically. The ‘daffodil poetry’ is more enjoyable now because we know that it does not give us ‘knowledge’ about them (in the previous scenario such poems imparted ‘poetic-knowledge’ about ‘daffodil’, which nobody understood but simply nodded wisely with ‘deep understanding’ ) but does something entirely different instead. In fact, we can now say that some of what was called ‘revolutionary poetry’ is simply awful and it was, indeed, ‘eye-blinding’ because it does blind, if presented as ‘knowledge’. And so on. That is, this knowledge not only helps answer questions about having or acquiring of ‘daffodil’ but also allows us to separate wheat from chaff. It is easier to group items now. Even if there are disagreements of this or that item ( a poem, a painting) and whether it should be considered as ‘good’ or ‘bad’ exemplar, we can do what was impossible before earlier: at least speak about trash and rubbish, attempt a useful and intelligible classification and go about growing daffodils. We know which weed stifles daffodils and which non-daffodil item (say manure, for example) nourishes its growth.\nSubstitute ‘enlightenment’ for ‘daffodil’, only after the previous scenarios have sunk in. There is much stuff about enlightenment: from bad poetry (which we dare not call ‘bad’ because the ‘enlightened’ are alleged to have spoken it) that gives you absolutely no ‘adhyatmic knowledge’ through the world-renown Sadhakas instructing us in endless, time-consuming, ‘till-death-do-us-part’ Sadhanas to turgid prose that even the writer himself cannot understand. We all want ‘enlightenment’ but we do not even have a clue whether it is a feeling, an emotion, a state of mind or a set of sentences (the ‘mahavakyas’, for instance) or an utterly mysterious boon that extra-terrestrial creatures gift only to their followers. Are the Upanishadic texts something like the general theory of relativity or more akin to Maxwell’s equations in Thermodynamics? is the Gita an advanced text book like Feynman’s Lectures on Physics or is it a primer in mathematical operations like addition, multiplication and division? Are the dialogues of the Buddha oral instructions about how to fix a leaking tap or an impenetrable Sartrean discourse about ‘Nothingness’…? Etc. The ‘learned’, the ‘wise’ and the ‘enlightened’ hold forth endlessly, the way they do in the first scenario. But these do not help ordinary mortals, do they, excepting those who write bullshit.\nYou say you desire ‘daffodil’. May I have it? You ask. Yes, you may. However, know the nature of the top soil, the required environment, and how to grow it, if that is what you desire. Know that there are daffodil seeds and that daffodil is a flower (not Bordeaux wine, for instance). True, beautiful daffodils are seen in different regions. If it cannot be grown in your region, you might have to set up a botanical shed. However, you cannot get what you desire by not knowing what a daffodil is and merely (diligently, piously and with great dedication) reading bad ‘eye-blinding poetry’ as beautiful ‘poetic-knowledge’ about daffodils.\nWhat is it that you seek, when you ask whether a Christian can be enlightened? The answer is evident: yes, anybody can have daffodil. Does this answer help? If it does not, know that your question can elicit only this answer, in so far as you want that answer to be intelligible.\nII\nQ: If we prepare the mind with the right context, might this story or some other of our stories not provide a way to get to the framework that is currently obscured to us and elusive?\nYes, they would. But the issue is how do we prepare the mind with the right context? Since this is the question and I cannot answer it in any simple fashion, let me use this imagery.\nImagine that we have a huge and gigantic heap of things. We know that this heap contains many things: multiple kinds of seeds, different kinds of fertilizers, various types of earth, incredibly different kinds of instruments. There are also any number of manuscripts half eaten by dust written in a language you do not understand, even if you can read the letters. And printed books (with missing title pages, etc.) written in English even if you cannot know whether they are the ‘originals’ or translations and, if the latter, what they translate. Suppose that you want to grow a rare rose. You know that all the requirements for growing that rose are at hand. Question: how do you choose the right things to grow that rose?\nThis is where we are. Our culture is that heap. We have our Sanskrit books and many other books in English that allegedly ‘translate’. Our task is to cultivate the mind. In principle, we have all we need to complete the task. Question: how do we do go about doing it? Do we first need to read a translation (of what? God alone knows) or do we just randomly pick something from the heap and go forward?\nzrp:le1 \u0026amp; 9/18/21\n","tags":[],"title":"Knowledge and Bullshit about Daffodil","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/shock-and-awe-of-enlightenment/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","published","Sarah"],"content":"Original. [ Appeared in Christendom en filosofie : opstellen over wijsbegeerte, wereldbeeld en wetenschappen van het antieke christendom over Nietzsche tot fundamentalisme vandaag. p.51-82]\nIn this article, we would like to reflect upon the contemporary relevance of the encounter between ancient Roman culture and Early Christianity. There is a reason for choosing this theme. Today, a few heathen cultures (for instance, those of India and China) have become important once again to the history of mankind. Irrespective of what else is said about the cultures of India or China, in the course of this millennium, these two are going to have a significant impact in the world. In the renewed meeting between India and China on the one hand and the western culture on the other, two issues are going to become central once again: (a) how they look at Christianity and Christian cultures and (b) how the western culture has learnt to look at them.\nWhat has Early Christianity to do with the 21st century meeting between cultures? In some senses, everything. The pagan cultures of today, like India and China, raise questions similar to those that the pagan writers from Ancient Rome asked; the heathens of today (from these two cultures) face similar difficulties that intellectuals from Ancient Rome faced. Their predicament too is almost identical: they have difficulties in comprehending the stances of Christianity. We will focus on some of these questions in the course of this paper. However, let us notice something about the probable outcome of this possible dialogue: unlike the Ancients, the Indians and the Chinese of today will not disappear; nor would they be willing to accept the answers that Early Christianity gave. We need to study Early Christianity, if we want to understand the questions the modern-day heathens are asking. Antiquity is our route to the contemporary world. This is only one side of the coin.\nThere is also a second side to the coin. We suggest that the current understanding of India and China (and of pagan cultures, generally) is largely defined by how Early Christianity described the Roman pagans. That is to say, what the western culture of today thinks it knows about these cultures is directly related to how Early Christianity succeeded or failed in describing pagan cultures. Whether one looks at Christian theology or at a secular field like religious studies or at a discipline like anthropology or in the so-called scientific debates in evolutionary biology and evolutionary psychology about religion, the tale is the same: they all tell the same story about Indian and Chinese religions. Not because what is told is ‘the truth’ but because Early Christianity defined both the questions and the answers. It laid the seeds of a particular way of studying ‘other religions’.\nThese two aspects merely provide the contexts for approaching a study of the interaction between the Ancient Romans and Antique Christianity. Given the length of this article, it will not be possible to elaborate on the above mentioned contexts; it requires a sequel where we hope to pen these issues in detail.[1] For the time being, we will focus mainly on the relationship between the Romans and Antique Christianity.\nBefore doing so, let us confess to a limitation. We are not classicists and do not know either Greek or Latin very well. Nor, for that matter, are we trained Christian theologians. Yet, we fare in waters where only classicists and theologians dare journey. This attitude does not express pretension or, for that matter, a disregard for the need to know the classical languages; instead, it is symptomatic of the strangeness of the situation we are all caught in. This too has lessons for us all, but even this will not be discussed it in the course of this paper. With these preliminaries out of the way, let us now concentrate on outlining the pagan and Christian debates in ancient Rome, from a contemporary pagan perspective.\nI\nTo a visitor from another intellectual and cultural world, what is striking about the descriptions of the Roman society a hun­dred years before the Common Era onwards is this:[2] the extraordinary role played by the multiplicity of associ­a­tions, of philo­sophi­cal schools, of cults and cultic practices in the Ro­man social life. Many of these associations were also the harbingers of po­lit­ical intrigues, as suc­cessive em­perors were to find out. Regularly, asso­cia­tions of specific professions (butchers, tailors, under­takers, etc.) sup­ported candi­dates for political power; their acti­v­ities, in terms of cere­mo­nies and ritual practices, often over­lap­ped partly with those of the cults.\nThe Roman empire was made up of about 1200 city units, plus a con­sid­erable number of ethnic groupings which we label ‘tribes’ and/or ‘cli­ent kingdoms’. The divine forces worshipped in each of these units might be seen as similar, analogous, or parallel; one obvious example is the Juno, the cohesive force which gives life to any social unit, whether a family or a city-state. The Romans wor­shipped not only the Juno who had once belonged to their own kings – Juno Regina – but also the Junones of other states whom the Romans had invited to abandon their original com­munities and settle at Rome. These Junones were paral­lel, but not iden­tical, in the same way as the many Jupiters and Zeuses wor­shipped throughout the empire were parallel but not identical. Each cult hon­oured its own god.[3]\nThere is an uncanny parallel between what Wiedemann says about the Junones in the Roman Empire and, say, the multiple Mahabharata’s in India of today. As any student of India knows, the characters from this epic do not have the same weight and importance as one travels along the different regions and among different peoples in India. The Bhima or a Hidimba in the north of India are not quite the same characters when one encounters them in the South: their roles, their relative weights in the epic, their symbolic presence, etc vary enough among the regions for us to speak of ‘parallel’ but not identical Mahabahratas.\nBe that as it may, this colorful variety and bewildering profusion in the Roman Empire were sup­ported by a toleration of differences – a toleration that bor­dered on indiffer­ence towards the difference. Even though attempts were often undertaken to sup­press the activities of this or that imported cult,[4] a peculiar kind of tole­rance permeated the Roman cultural world. For example, the cult of Isis existed for a long time in Rome with­out being ‘licensed’, and was suppressed thrice in Rome during 60 and 50. Very soon it was tolerated again, enjoying a certain amount of protection under Augustus. We see Agrippa and Ti­berius drive it away from the city, only to have it come back and flour­ish by the time of Nero. Domi­tian apparently was planning to rebuild its temple after it got burnt down during the period of Titus. One rea­son for this tole­rance, which bordered on a peculiar kind of indifference, at least during those periods when things went well for the em­perors and the citizens of a city-state, was the unanswerable ques­tion: Who is to say which gods are to be celebrated, which not?\nOne reason why the question was unanswerable had to do with the fact of diversity. The many flourishing and not-so-prosperous cults; the theories and disputa­tions concerning the nature and existence of gods; the philosophical schools and their differing theories about man and Nature – all these indexed two truths about human beings. First, it is in the very nature of human existence to entertain multiple per­spec­tives; two, because of this, diversity and difference was inevi­table in human communities. Minu­cius Felix, a Christian writer from around 210 C.E., makes Caecilius – the pagan protagonist in The Octavius – express the above thoughts in the follow­ing way: “ll things in human affairs are doubtful, uncertain, and unsettled, and all things are rather probable than true\u0026hellip;And thus all men must be indignant, all men must feel pain, that certain persons…should dare to determine on any certainty concerning the nature at large, and the (divine) majesty, of which so many of the multitude of sects in all ages (still doubt), and philosophy itself deliberates still.”[5]\nAbout some forty years earlier, Athenagoras the Athenian had to enter A Plea for the Christians. This remarkable document, written around 177 C.E., is addressed to the Emperor with the request that the Christians be allowed to practice their worship. The argument for ‘tolerance’, coming as it does from a Christian writer, begins by noticing that diversity is a fact in the Roman Empire.\nIn your empire\u0026hellip;different nations have different customs and laws; and no one is hindered by law or fear of punishment from following his ancestral usages, however ridiculous they may be\u0026hellip; In short, among every nation and people, men offer whatever sacri­fices and celebrate whatever mysteries they please\u0026hellip; And to all of these both you and the laws give permission so to act, deeming, on the one hand, that to believe in no god at all is impious and wicked, and on the other, that it is neces­sary for each man to wor­ship the gods he prefers\u0026hellip;.[6]\nThose wont to believe in one Supreme God had little problems in respect­ing those many deities which were part of the Roman land­scape. It was never too late for those who celebrated na­tive and familiar deities, to import exotic gods from other cultures and far-off places.[7] Amidst these, certain practices were zealously preserved: resi­dents of cities ‘had to’ participate in the religious practices and ceremo­nies that celebrated the deities of the cities. We empha­size ‘had to’ and place it in scare quotes because this is a puzzle, surely, for all students of the Roman culture: how was this participa­tion secured? Why was the populace intoler­ant of those who did not do so?[8]\nII\nThis issue becomes intriguing when we consider the rela­tion between the intellec­tuals of this culture and the religious prac­tices of their day. Clearly, there was no dearth of books, tracts, and philosophi­cal schools, decry­ing, deni­grating, and dismissing the importance of gods or even denying their existence. Though dan­gerous, even individ­uals dared it: Lucian, the famous satirist from the second century, open­ly challenged the Cult of Glycon – visiting its chief priest, poking around its shrine, asking questions with a grin on his face. The danger lay in mockery and not so much in the cha­l­lenge. Even mockery, in so far as it was directed against the credulous, like Plutarch\u0026rsquo;s De Superstitione (On Supersti­tion ) for instance, was welcome.[9]\nWe do not need to go further than Cicero to be convinced of this fact. The so­cial, psychological, and epistemic speculations put across in De Natura Deo­rum (On the Nature of the Gods) to account for the origin of religion sound very modern even today. The arsenal of arguments which supported the 18th century European intel­lectuals’ attack against religion came primarily from this work. Yet, Cicero him­self was a priest. Though a skeptic and a critic of augury, he re­tained his membership in the board of augurs of the Republic. Epicurus urged his followers to take part in sacri­fices, while participating in the reli­gious festi­vals of Athens, and was initiated into the Eleusinian mys­ter­ies. His follower, Lucre­tius, fol­lowed the master\u0026rsquo;s example in venerating ances­tral gods. Plutarch, author of the famous essay against supersti­tion, spent his later life as a priest in Delphi composing tracts on divine punish­ment and evident terrors of the next world. From today\u0026rsquo;s optic, this curious division between what they said and what they did is beau­tiful­ly exemplified by Gaius Cotta – the Aca­demic skeptic in Cice­ro\u0026rsquo;s dia­logue De Natura Deorum:\nI, who am a high priest, and who hold it to be a duty most solemn­ly to maintain the rights and doctrines of the established religion, should be glad to be con­vin­ced of this fundamental tenet of divine existence, not as an ar­ticle of faith merely but as an ascer­tained fact. For many disturb­ing reflec­tions occur to my mind, which sometimes make me think that there are no gods at all.[10]\nHow to understand this almost prototypical Roman phe­nom­enon of participating in religious activities and sacri­fices, often­times even leading them, and of not believing in the gods and the deities to whom such sacri­fices were offered? How could one deny the existence of gods and yet officiate at the reli­gious ceremonials? Here is one answer: what­ever their philo­sophi­cal predilections, the intellec­tuals from Antiquity did not counter­pose their beliefs and doctrines to the religious practices of their day; that is, such was the Roman religio that its practice was indifferent to any given (in the sense of fixed) set of doc­trines.\nThe Roman culture appears to have allowed two distinct things to co-exist: theoretical disquisitions about gods and religio on the one hand, and religious prac­tices on the other. If the former were not the rea­sons for the latter, how was the participa­tion of the people ensured? What was, or could have been, religion in the Roman world? The participants in Cicero\u0026rsquo;s dialogue give us the best answer. Cotta, the skeptic:\nI am considerably influenced\u0026hellip;by the plea that you put forward\u0026hellip;when you exhorted me to remember that I am both a Cotta and a pontiff. This is no doubt meant that I ought to uphold beliefs about the immortal gods which have come down to us from our ancestors, and the rites and ceremonies and duties of religion. For my part, I shall always uphold them and have always done so, and no eloquence of any­body, learned or unlearned shall ever dislodge me from the belief\u0026hellip;which I have inherited from our fore­fathers\u0026hellip; Balbus\u0026hellip;­you are a philosopher, and I ought to receive from you a proof of your reli­gion, where­as I must believe the word of our an­cestors even without proof.[11]\nThough the citation speaks for itself, two points are worth re­em­pha­siz­ing: first, some things are retained because they have been transmitted over gen­er­ations and this accounts for their legitimacy; second, philosophical argu­mentation may establish or disprove some opinion, but it is irrelevant to traditional practice. The last point is made even more strongly later:\nAlthough I for my part cannot be persuaded to surrender my belief that the gods exist, neverthe­less you teach me no reason why this belief, of which I am convin­ced on the authority of our fore­fathers, should be true.[12]\nIt is important to note how Cotta argues. That Balbus feels a need to prove the existence of gods is used by the skeptic to show that his oppo­nent is looking for wrong things in the wrong place:\nYou did not really feel confident that the doctrine of the divine existence was as self-evident as you could wish, and for that reason you attempted to prove it with a number of arguments. For my part a simple argument would have sufficed, namely that it has been handed down to us by our forefathers. But you despise authority, and fight your battles with the weapon of reason. Give permission therefore for my reason to join issue with yours.[13]\nThe permission is given and the battle is joined. Cotta‘s central the­sis is that one’s beliefs about the existence or nonexistence of gods are irrel­evant to religion because religion is handed down over gener­ations. Not that religion is transmitted among other things as well, but that which is transmitted is religion. As Plutarch puts it in Amatorius:\nOur father then, addressing Pemptides by name, said, “You seem to me, Pemp­tides, to be handling a very big matter and a risky one – or rather, you are discu­ssing what should not be discussed at all, when you ques­tion the opinion we hold about the gods, and ask reason and demonstra­tion about everything. *For the anci­ent and ancestral faith is enough, and no clearer proof could be found than itself\u0026hellip;*it is a common home and an establi­shed foundation for all piety; and if in one point its stable and traditional character be shaken and dis­turbed, it will be under­mined and no one will trust it\u0026hellip;If you demand proof about each of the ancient gods, laying hands on everything sacred and bring your sophistry to play on every altar, *you will leave nothing free from quibble and cross-exami­na­tion\u0026hellip;*Do you see, then, the abyss of atheism at our feet, if we resolve each of the gods into a passion or a force or a virtue?[14]\nIn The Octavius, Caecilius the pagan argues his case thus:\nas high priest of truth, to receive the teaching of your ances­tors, to cultivate the religion handed down to you, to adore the gods whom you were first trained by your parents to fear\u0026hellip;not to assert an opinion concerning the deities, but to believe your fore­fathers...[15]\nReligion, then, appears to fall together with tradition – religio is tra­di­tio. Continuing a tradition does not require any reason other than itself, viz., what is being con­tinued is tradi­tion itself. That is to say, no theor­etical justification was needed to prac­tice and uphold ances­tral customs:\nThe primary test of truth in religious matters was custom and tradi­tion, the prac­tices of the ancients\u0026hellip;In philosophical matters one might turn to intel­lectuals and philosophers, but in religious ques­tions one looked to the past, to the acce­pted practices handed down by tradition, and to the guarantors of this tradition, the priests.”[16] Ramsay MacMullen makes an analogous remark: “(T)here was very little doubt in people’s minds that the religious prac­tices of one generation should be cherished without change by the next, whether within one’s own community or another’s. To be pious in any sense, to be respectable and decent, required the per­petuation of cult, even if one’s judges themselves worshi­p­ped quite other gods.[17]\nThe intellectuals of the Ancient Roman culture are not dogmatic traditional­ists de­fend­ing this or that par­ticular practice by appealing to the fact that their fathers and fore­fathers always per­formed them too. After all, as our history books never tire of mention­ing, they pioneered the spirit of scientific enquiry – the spirit of ruthlessly question­ing every belief. Yet, there was a sphere, religio, which was not affec­ted by critical questioning, and practiced because it was traditio.\nThe late republic was an age of rationalism, certain­ly as far as the Roman nobility was concerned. But this tendency was never taken to its logical con­clusion, rejec­tion of traditional religious practice\u0026hellip;Such respect for ancestral authority would assure the continuity of traditional ritual, just as the child­hood associations, family tradition, and the pecu­liar nature of pagan beliefs would tend to preserve tradi­tional mental attitudes.[18]\nAs Cicero puts it at the end of his work De Divinatione : “It is wise and reasonable for us to preserve the institutions of our fore­fathers by retaining their rites and ceremonies.”[19] Whose tradition is it? Obviously of a people. Which people? Why those that belonged to a city, of course. Consequently, an identifi­able people, identified by their relation to a city, with a language and his­tory, had tradition. Different gro­ups would have differ­ent tradi­tions: besides practicing their own traditions, however, they had to respect the tradi­tions of the peoples among whom they lived. Of course, this did not mean that the populace was ‘tolerant’ in reli­gious matters as we understand the term today. “Again, because of people’s narrowness­ of curiosity and loyalty the beliefs of some neigh­bouring region or city might have no reality; and such in­dif­fer­ence could be simply accepted: ‘all men do not worship all gods, but each, a certain one that he acknowledges’.”[20]\nThere is the following famous passage of Plutarch (67.377) in On Isis and Osiris which, in the words of Molly Whittaker, “would have been acceptable to any religious and educated Pagan, especi­ally to a stoic”:\nWe do not conceive of the gods as different among different peoples, nor as bar­barians and Greek, nor as southern and northern; but just as sun and moon and sky and earth and sea are common to all men, but have different names among different people, so for that one Reason which sets all things in order and for that one Providence which has oversight over them and for the attendant powers, which are set over all, dif­ferent honours and names have come into being among dif­ferent peoples ac­cording to their customs.[21]\nSimilar thoughts are expressed by Quintus Aurelius Symmachus, the last pagan prefect of Rome. In a justly famous letter to the Emperor, plead­ing the cause of the pagan cults within the framework of a bellicose and aggressive Christian march to power, Symmachus says:\n*Grant, I beg you, that what in our youth we took over from our fathers, we may in our old age hand on to posterity. The love of estab­lished prac­tice is a powerful sentiment\u0026hellip;*Everyone has his own customs, his own religious practices; the divine mind has assigned to different cities different religions to be their guard­ians. Each man is given at birth a separate soul; in the same way each people is given its own special genius to take care of its destiny\u0026hellip;If long passage of time lends validity to religious ob­servances, we ought to keep faith with so many cen­turies, we ought to follow our forefathers who followed their forefathers and were blessed in so doing\u0026hellip;And so we ask for peace for the gods of our fathers, for the gods of our native land. It is reasonable that whatever each of us worships is really to be con­sidered one and the same. We gaze up at the same stars, the sky covers us all, the same uni­verse compasses us. What does it matter what practical system we adopt in our search for truth? Not by one avenue only can we arrive at so tremendous a secret.[22]\nWhen one looks at religion as tradition, that is, as a set of practices transmitted over generations, then the term appears as a minor variant of our intu­itive notion of culture: to have religion is to have cul­ture. Where there is a people with a his­tory, identifying them­selves as a people, there tra­ditions exist too. In other words, they have religio too. This is how the pagans appear to have seen the issue. As Balbus the Stoic, com­ments: \u0026ldquo;f we care to com­pare our national characteristics with those of foreign peo­ples, we shall find that, while in all other respects we are only the equals or even the inferior of others, yet in the sense of reli­gion, that is, in reverence for the gods, we are far superior.”[23] Which ‘national characteristic’ is Balbus referring to? Per­haps he refers to the feature that, where­as each people has its local gods and national rites, the Romans worship all divinities.\nAccording to Caeci­lius, it even accounted for the supremacy of the Roman Empire:\n\u0026hellip;in the city of an enemy, when taken while still in the fury of victory, they venerate the con­quer­ed deities;\u0026hellip;in all directions they seek for the gods of the strangers, and make them their own;\u0026hellip;they build altars even to unknown deities\u0026hellip;Thus, in that they acknowledge the sacred insti­tutions of all nations, they have also deserved their dominion.[24]\nTolerance of different tradi­tions, ‘res­pect’ for tradition demonstrat­ed actual­ly by practicing the tradition of the other where and when ne­cess­ary, appear to charac­ter­ize the Roman religio. The religiones of the ancient Romans was a continuation of ancestral traditions. It is tradition that distinguishes peoples from each other.\nIII\nHow could one place the earlier prosecution of the Jews and the later persecu­tion of the Christians within the context of such an attitude? Des­pite the fact that many aspects of an answer to this ques­tion will not be touched on, at least one element of the answer is obvious: the funda­men­tal objection[25] will have been that Judaism and Christianity are not reli­giones, i.e., they are not tradi­ti­ons. Consequently, they refuse to recogni­ze that the traditions of other peoples and places are valid.\nThe Jews appear to have met this charge in two ways: first, by showing that the Jews were a people with history; second, by laying claims to great antiquity. The many apologe­tic texts written by the Hel­lenic and Alex­an­drian Jews, the most famous of which was writ­ten by Philo of Alex­andria, attempted to argue that Ju­daism and Israel were more ancient than the Ancients themselves: Greek legis­la­tors, claimed Philo, actually plagiarized the Mosaic Law, and that Heraclitus stole his theory of op­posites from Moses “like a thief.”[26] This trend with­in Ju­daism to establish its antiquity, we would like to sug­gest, is noth­ing other than to show and demonstrate that Judaism was a ‘traditio’. When a group claims ex­emp­tion from practicing the tradi­tions of others, the most important ‘proper­ty’ is its antiquity. The Jews could argue that theirs was the most ancient of all traditions, there­fore ‘religio’ a fortiori, which allowed them not to follow the tradi­tions of others in matters of con­flict­ing in­junctions.\nIt is important to recognize the novelty of the Jewish apolo­getics: with varying degrees of success, they tried to provide theoreti­cal justifications as to why their traditional practice did not allow them to “seek the gods of the strangers”. It was not sufficient to show that the Jews followed an ancient custom given to them by Moses. They had to justify that their ancestral practice forbade them from wor­shipping the various deities that littered the Roman landscape. That is to say, they had to provide a ‘philosophical’ un­der­pin­ning to their ancient custom. That is what the apologetic texts at­tempt­ed: explain why, if the Jews had traditio, they would not ven­erate the ancestral customs of other peoples. Their explana­tion, of course, centered around their scripture – more precisely, about its truth.\nThe uneasy recognition that the Judaic tradition had obtained in the Roman empire can be observed in the way Celsus, one of the first Roman critics of Christianity, speaks about the Jews. Even though he is supposed to have de­spised many of the Jewish cus­toms, he nevertheless notes:\nAs the Jews, then, became a peculiar people, and enacted laws in keeping with the customs of their country, and maintained them up to the present time, and observe a way of worship which, whatever be its nature, is yet derived from their fathers, they act in these respects like other men, because each nation retains its ancestral customs, whatever they are, if they happen to be established among them.[27]\nCornelius Tacitus, the Roman historian, is not known for his sym­pathies towards the Jewish religion either. Speaking of the Jews to whom “all things are profane that we hold sacred”,[28] and who “regard as permiss­ible what seems to us immoral”,[29] he nonetheless acknowledges: “Whatever their origin, these observances are sanctioned by their antiquity.”[30]\nAn­tic­i­pat­ing the end of the world any moment[31] and projecting the second coming of Christ onto the immediate future,[32] the zeal of the Christians tended to ignore the cultural matrix they were function­ing in. But, when it became clear that the world would not end so soon, their pro­blem became obvi­ous: they were ‘a people’ without tradi­tion. Porphyry, for example, is said to have alleged that the Christians are guilty of “…the greatest impiety in taking no account of powers so manifest and so be­nefi­cent, but directly breaking the laws, which require everyone to reverence ancestral customs, and not disturb what should be inviolable, but to walk orderly in following the religion of his fore­fathers and not to be meddlesome through love of in­nova­tion.”[33]\nIn the light of what we have said, it is evident that those who had no tra­dition would have been accused of athe­ism. Such indeed was the criticism leveled against Chris­tians by the pagans. That is, as the pagans of that period saw it, the early Chris­tians were ‘athe­ists’ lack­ing religion.[34] In a long pass­age, that is sup­pos­ed to derive from Por­phyry,[35] Eusebius summarizes the charges thus:\n(H)ow can men fail to be in every way impious and atheistical, who have apos­tat­ized from those ancestral gods by whom every nation and every state is sustained? Or what good can they reasonably hope for, who have set themselves at enmity and at war against their preservers, and have thrust away their benefac­tors? For what else are they doing than fighting against the gods?\nAnd what forgiveness shall they be thought to deserve, who have turn­ed away from those who from the earliest time, among all Greeks and Bar­barians, both in cities and in the country, are recognized as gods with all kinds of sacri­fices, and initiations, and mysteries by all alike, kings law-givers and philos­ophers, and have chosen all that is impi­ous and atheis­tical among the doctrines of men?\u0026hellip;\n(They have not adhered) to the God who is hon­oured among the Jews ac­cording to their customary rites, *but (have) cut out for themselves a new kind of track\u0026hellip;*that keeps neither the ways of the Greeks nor those of the Jews.[36]\nTatian, in his Oratio ad Graecos, tells his pagan public not to think that he “…(in) aspiring to be above the Greeks, above the infinite number of philosophic inquirers, has struck out a new path, and embraced the doc­trine of Barbar­ians.”[37] In 303 C.E., Diocletian began the final persecution of the Christians. In the early parts of his reign, the mastermind behind such persecutions was Galerius, rather than Diocletian himself. When calamities were coming to an end, Galerius published an edict to finally stop the persecutions, clearly explaining why the Christians were disliked that much – not because they did not worship the gods of Rome, but because they did not have a tradition:\nIt has been our aim in an especial manner, that the Christians also, who had abandoned the religion of their forefathers, should return to right opinions. For such willfulness and folly had, we know not how, taken possession of them, that instead of observing those ancient institutions, which possibly their own forefathers had established, they, through caprice, made laws to themselves, and drew together into different societies many men of widely different persuasions.\nAfter the publication of our edict, ordaining the Christians to betake themselves to the observance of the ancient institutions, many of them were subdued through the fear of danger, and moreover many of them were exposed to jeopardy; nevertheless, because great numbers still persist in their opinions, and because we have perceived that at present they neither pay reverence and due adoration to the gods, nor yet worship their own God, therefore we, from our wonted clemency in bestowing pardon on all, have judged it fit to extend our indulgence to those men, and to permit them again to be Christians, and to establish the places of their religious assemblies; yet so as that they offend not against good order.[38]\nThe Christians could not follow the route taken by the Jews, although they had to lay claim to the Judaic tradition. As Chris­tians, they rejected the Mosaic Law; yet, they had to show that they were religio nonetheless. Hence the challenge that the Christians were faced with: they were not Jews; nor were they Romans. The Chris­tians could not, in any straightforward way, see themselves as a people with a his­tory, a tradi­tion, a lan­guage – that is, they could not trace themselves back to any particular people. The Jews could; the Romans could; even the Egyp­tians who “worshipped cats, crocodiles, serpents, asps and dogs” could. But the Christians alone could not. They had to show that Christianity was religio even though their enemies accused them of not being a traditio. And that they set out to do.\nIV\nHowever, this pagan challenge to Christianity came embedded in a series of criticisms. Each of these was repeated in multiple ways whenever Christianity met pagan cultures, whether from India or from China. Some of these issues are worth noting in our context because they not only help us understanding the pagan point of view but also in seeing how Christianity finally met the pagan challenge.\n(a) One of the greatest problems the pagans faced had to with the Christian God and His relationship to Jesus Christ. Using human predicates and attributing human desires to this entity, Celsus wonders why the ‘supreme being,’ beautiful, good and blessed, would ascend among men and hence, undergo a change from good to evil, from virtue to vice, and from happiness to misery. Only mortals could wish to make such changes; the ‘supreme being’ would never admit of it, certainly not for the worse.[39] The Christian ‘God’ had become a mere immortal in the hands of Celsus. Consequently, he could also judge the deeds of this ‘God’ in human terms. He asks why He who sent his son to mankind with the instruction to worship Him alone also allowed His son to be treated cruelly. What kind of a father would ever be that inhuman?[40] Celsus could not think of ‘God’, who behaved ‘inhumanly’. This is the first gulf separating the Pagans and the Christians, a gulf that tells us about the extent to which the Pagans misunderstood the doctrines of Christianity.\n(b) Consequent to this, the pagans also had great difficulties in understanding the refusal of the Christians to indulge in ‘idolatry’. Celsus, for instance, was unable to figure out the Biblical injunctions about idolatry or why it was considered as a sin. By virtue of this failure, the pagans were also quite incensed by the refusal of the Christians to worship the Roman deities.[41]\n(c) Consistent with these arguments, Celsus ridicules the Christian hopes for their resurrection. Much the same way he rooted the Christian God in a human anthropology, he founds the Christian hopes for an after-life in human biology and natural processes:\nIt is folly on their part to suppose that when God, as if He were a cook, introduces the fire (which is to consume the world), all the rest of the human race will be burnt up, while they alone will remain, not only such of them as are then alive, but also those who are long since dead, which latter will arise from the earth clothed with the self-same flesh (as during life); for such a hope is simply one which might be cherished by worms. For what sort of human soul is that which would still long for a body that had been subject to corruption?[42]\n(d) Minucius Felix ridicules the Christian dread for idolatry as an expression of their fear of the gods they reject. He also relates it to their hopes for after-life and their ‘ascetic’ contemporaneous existence.\nYou do not visit exhibitions; you have no concern in public displays; you reject the public banquets, and abhor the sacred contests; the meats previously tasted by, and the drinks made a libation of upon, the altars. Thus you stand in dread of the gods whom you deny. You do not wreath your heads with flowers; you do not grace your bodies with odours; you reserve unguents for funeral rites; you even refuse garlands to your sepulchres—pallid, trembling beings, worthy of the pity even of our gods! Thus, wretched as you are, you neither rise again, nor do you live in the meanwhile. Therefore (…) cease from prying into the regions of the sky, and the destinies and secrets of the world: it is sufficient to look before your feet, especially for untaught, uncultivated, boorish, rustic people: they who have no capacity for understanding civil matters, are much more denied the ability to discuss divine. [43]\n(e) What about the nature of the Christian church or the kind of people invited to their assemblies?[44] Celsus draws a parallel between the people invited to join and participate in the pagan cults and the Christian invitations thus. The striking difference lies in the fact that the Christians invite sinners and thieves: “…let us hear what kind of persons these Christians invite. Every one, they say, who is a sinner, who is devoid of understanding, who is a child, and, to speak generally, whoever is unfortunate, him will the kingdom of God receive. Do you not call him a sinner, then, who is unjust, and a thief, and a housebreaker, and a poisoner, and a committer of sacrilege, and a robber of the dead? What others would a man invite if he were issuing a proclamation for an assembly of robbers?”[45]\n(f) Given the above, how would the pagans look at the Christian morality? What could they make out of the relation between ‘being moral’ and attaining salvation by following Jesus Christ? Porphyry, for instance,[46] apparently had this to say about the relationship that the Christians postulated and human moral psychology: ““It is easier for a camel to go through a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven.” On the one hand, if a rich man, who stayed away from the sins of the flesh—from murder, thievery, adultery, cheating, lying, fornication and blasphemy—was denied any heavenly reward, what use it would be for rich men to be good? On the other, if the poor were destined to reach heaven, what would prevent them for doing anything they liked?” If such is the case, what relationship is there between morality and salvation? Porphyry again: “Who wouldn’t prefer a life of corruption, based on the strength of these ; who would not choose a life of evildoing and unutterable wickedness if he knew in advance that all would be forgiven him if only he believed and was baptized, confident in his heart that the judge of the living and the dead would pardon any offense he had committed.”[47]\n(g) Finally, all these considerations militate against the claim to universality, which Christianity put forward. Such a claim cannot be made by any human being or any human group whatsoever. It cannot simply be the result of any kind of human research. St. Augustine summarizes the argument from Porphyry’s De Regressu Animae as follows: “o system of doctrine which furnishes the universal way for delivering the soul has yet been received, either from the truest philosophy, or from the ideas or practices of the Indians, or from the reasoning of the Chaldeans, or from any source whatsoever…”[48] If this is the case, the reign that the Christians envisage is also humanly impossible. Origen paraphrases Celsus’ argument thus: “If it were possible,” implying at the same time that he thought it most desirable, “that all the inhabitants of Asia, Europe, and Libya, Greeks and Barbarians, all to the uttermost ends of the earth, were to come under one law;” but judging this quite impossible, he adds, “Any one who thinks this possible, knows nothing.”[49]\nWhat we see in a consistent fashion in all these criticisms is the following: the pagans looked at Christianity as a doctrine that was analogous to those they were familiar with. And they were familiar with philosophical schools and human doctrines; those that were expressions of a human search for truth, embodiments of human striving to understand the mysteries of Cosmos and society. In doing so, they were unable to comprehend the way Christianity had defined itself from the very beginning, as something that was not authored by any human being but by ‘God’ Himself. In The Epistle to Diognetus, purported to be a reply to the inquiries of an interested pagan, the anonymous writer who called himself Mathetes explains the manner in which the Christians saw themselves:\nFor the Christians are distinguished from other men neither by country, nor language, nor the customs which they observe. For they neither inhabit cities of their own, nor employ a peculiar form of speech, nor lead a life which is marked out by any singularity. The course of conduct which they follow has not been devised by any speculation or deliberation of inquisitive men; nor do they, like some, proclaim themselves the advocates of any merely human doctrines…For, as I said, this was no mere earthly invention which was delivered to them, nor is it a mere human system of opinion, which they judge it right to preserve so carefully, nor has a dispensation of mere human mysteries been committed to them, but truly God himself, who is almighty, the Creator of all things, and invisible, has sent from heaven, and paced among men, [Him who is] the truth, and the holy and incomprehensible Word, and has firmly established Him in their hearts.[50]\nQuite clearly, the pagans of Antiquity were quite blind to how Christianity looked at itself. Consequently, their challenge, namely, how could Christianity be religio when it was manifestly not a traditio of any people, was based not on the self-description and self-identity of Christianity. Instead, the pagans looked at Christianity through the framework and categories of their own world and culture. In doing so, they became blind to the kind of religion that Christianity claimed it was.\nV\nAs we have seen, one of the fundamental charges against Christianity was its novelty and youth. No nation had ever heard of the Jesus heralded by the Christians; as a religion, Christianity was not blessed as the ancestral custom of a people; they were, as said before, “meddlesome through love of innovation”. During the first five centuries, writer after writer from the Chris­tian church tried to establish the antiquity of Christianity.[51] Here, they followed the lead given by the Hellenic and Alexandrian Jews. Let us look at just exactly how the Christians established the antiquity of their religion, in order to understand the novelty in their attempts. Tatian, for instance, in his Oratio ad Graecos (Address to the Greeks), deems it proper “…to demonstrate that our philosophy is older than the system of the Greeks. Moses and Homer shall be our limits, each of them being of great antiquity\u0026hellip;Let us, then, institute a comparison between them; and we shall find that our doctrines are older, not only than those of the Greeks, but than the invention of letters.”[52] Having ‘established’ this to his satisfaction, he goes on further: “But the matter of principal importance is to endeavour with all accuracy to make it clear that Moses is not only older than Homer, but than all the writers that were before him\u0026hellip;”[53]\nDuring the second century, Theophilus of Antioch, after an equally thorough exposition of the Biblical chronology, makes it obvious that “…one can see the antiquity of the prophetical writings and the divinity of our doctrine, that the doctrine is not recent, nor our tenets mythical and false, as some think, but very ancient and true.”[54] Such arguments were not limited to one or two names; the roll-call reads like who-is-who of the early church fathers: Justin, Origen, Tertullian, Clement of Alexandria, Eusebius and, much later, even St. Augustine. Each of them tried to show, as Eusebius says in The History of the Church, that Christianity had long existed as “the first, most ancient, and most primitive of all reli­gions” and, therefore, “shown not to be modern and strange but, in all con­science, prim­itive, unique, and true.”[55]\nThere are two things of essential importance to the Christian apologetics regarding the antiquity of Christianity. The pagans challenged the Christians to show that the latter followed ancient and thus venerated customs and practices of their forefathers. The Jews had met this challenge by arguing not only that Moses was ‘older’ than Homer but also that, and this is crucial, they were faithful to their custom. The Christians by contrast, when they appro­priated the Jewish apo­logy, did the following: they tried to prove that their doctrines were ancient and therefore true. Instead of showing they were true to ancestral practices, they argued that they accepted doc­trines that were ancient. This is the first thing of importance. The second important thing can be formulated as a question: how could adherence to a doctrine be equivalent to following a practice? By focusing on these two issues, we shall also discover how Christianity met the pagan challenge.\nVI\nAs we know, during the first century C.E., Christianity was embroiled in a pol­emic with Judaism.[56] Chris­tians argued that the Messiah had arrived. The refusal of the Jews to accept this claim, the Christians believed, had to do with their inability to understand and interpret the scriptures properly. God\u0026rsquo;s promise to His ‘elect’ was fulfilled in the coming of Christ in flesh; but the sons of Israel – who were God’s elect – refused to see Jesus as Christ. The Old Testament made Christianity sensible but the refusal of the Jews to heed ‘their’ scriptures (as Christians inter­preted them) threatened to make Christianity senseless.\nConsequently, the patristic polemic against Judaism began to represent the latter as religiously moribund. It was argued that Israel “habitually had misunderstood all its prophets, Jesus included.”[57] At the same time, Christianity had to continue representing the Jewish past as its own. It had to find evidence for orthodox Christians throughout the history of Israel: “Judaism, in this view, appeared as erroneous from the start through its congenital ability to heed the Logos while various proto-Christians lay dormant throughout Israel’s history until the time of Jesus.”[58] For the early Christians, the Church had “replaced the Jews as the heirs to God’s promises” and was to be “the covenant partner with God.”[59] Later, Augustine would settle the issue by suggesting that the Jews had to continue to exist so as to “bear witness for us that we have not invented the prophecies concerning Christ” and also to confirm the prophecy that some would refuse to follow Christ and be damned for it. Thus, he added, “when the Jews do not believe in our Scriptures, their own Scriptures are fulfilled in them, while they read them with darkened eyes.”[60]\nTo some extent, the problematic relation of the early Christians with the Jews is captured in the ambi­guity of the Gospels themselves: the con­flicting injunctions that one ought to and ought not to preach among the gentiles: “Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you.”[61]And further, as instructions to the Apostles: “These twelve Jesus sent forth, and commanded them, saying, Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into any city of the Samari­tans enter ye not: But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.”[62] Or again, as Jesus answered his disciples: “I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.”[63] On the other hand, the same evangelists record Jesus saying: “And they shall come from the east, and from the west, and from the north and from the south, and shall sit down in the kingdom of God.”[64] Reflecting on these ideas, Vermes asks himself: “However did the evangelists manage to record such sayings as these, and at the same time attribute to Jesus the view that the Gentiles were soon to dis­place the ‘sons of the kingdom’, the Jews, as the elect of God?”[65]\nWe do not want to embroil myself in this controversy, over which much ink has been spilt. But we do want to draw atten­tion to the conclusion of the discussion: Christians saw their reli­gion as the fulfillment of Judaism. They alone were the followers of the true message of the scrip­tures. As Ignatius of Antioch, the Apostolic Father, formulated the thought in *The Epistle to the Magnesians: “*To profess Jesus Christ while continuing to follow Jewish custom is an absurdity. The Christian faith does not look to Judaism, but Judaism looks to Christianity \u0026hellip;”[66] The theme of the elect of God survives, but not the way Judaism saw it. The Christians are the elect now because they follow the doc­trine. When Christianity entered into pol­emics with the pagan thinkers, it saw itself as hav­ing superseded Judaism as the latter’s fulfillment. Together, the Old and the New Testament formed the Christian scriptures. In so far as these were the most ancient of all doctrines, Christianity was also ancient.\nThough it would take a few centuries for our story to take shape, we can follow a straight line to come to the point quickly. In their dispute with the Jews, the Christians had implicitly severed the tie between being a nation and having religion by argu­ing that Christians were the followers of the ‘true’ doctrines. As a result, their religion was everything that the Jews were waiting for. In their po­lem­ic with the pagans, Christians could travel much further along this path. However, now there is an extra sting in the tail of the tale they were to tell: Christian religion was not merely the fulfillment of the Jews but of all peoples. As Ignatius of Antioch continued the sentence in the epistle cited above (ibid.): “¼ , every other race and tongue that confesses a belief in God has now been comprehended.”[67]All that was ‘good’ and ‘noble’ in pagan thought have anticipated and expected the coming of Christ. The Christians were merely announcing the Good Word that the ‘expectation of nations’ had now been met.\nThus, the process of establishing the antiquity of Christianity took a new turn: many early Christian writers tried to show that Socrates, Plato, Virgil, and even the Sibylline Oracles had im­plicitly an­ticipated and prepared for the advent of the Gospels.[68] In very simple terms: all human nations and cultures, as Eusebius made it clear, were merely Praeparatio Evangelica. Once Christ came in flesh, the preparatory work was finished once and for all: Christianity was the reli­gion of the humankind.\nSuch a claim must have shocked the Roman sen­sibil­ities doubly: first, though manifestly no traditio of any nation, Christians claimed that they were religio; second, as ‘religio’ of all peo­ples (a contra­dic­tion in terms, if our claim about religio and traditio is cor­rect), Christians clai­med ex­emption from following the traditions of the cities because they alleged that all of them were wrong. That is to say, the Christians opposed their practices to the time-honored traditions of all peoples: Christianity was religio because it was not a traditio – the way all other human traditions are. The pagans challenged Christianity to show how it could be religio, when it was not a traditio of any people. Christianity met this challenge by reversing its terms and opposing traditio to religio: Christianity was religio precisely because it was not traditio.\nVII\nHow could they show this? The first move in answering this question was by opposing their beliefs, i.e., their the­o­logy to the prevalent practices. That is, Christians countered religion to tradition. From its very inception and in its polemic with Judaism, Christi­anity was forced to emphasize its doctrinal loyalty and purity. The Christians were the only true followers of the doctrines, whereas the Jews were not. This attitude towards doctrines was carried forward, when chal­lenged by the pagan milieu. The antiquity of Christianity was ‘demonstrated’ on grounds of the age of the Christian doctrine. Consequently, an extraordinary emphasis was placed on written texts and to their correct interpretations: “This attachment to written texts was remarkable in itself, even if it did not penetrate far down the social scale; there was little or nothing in Roman culture as a whole to induce such a development, and many fea­tures in this highly traditional society in fact worked against it.”[69]\nIn order to make their claims stick, Christians had to build a respectable theology. Moreover, because of the emphasis laid on the doctrines, they had to enter into disputes with ‘philosophers’. Un­fortunately though, Christians were hardly the intellectual equals of their oppo­nents.[70] In the early stages, Celsus charged, the Christians avoided all debates and dis­cussions with intellectuals: “We see that those who display their trickery in the market-places and go about begging would never enter a gathering of intelligent men, nor would they dare to reveal their noble beliefs in their pres­ence; but when­ever they see adolescent boys and a crowd of slaves and a company of fools they push themselves in and show off.”[71] Celsus’ charge appears extremely plau­si­ble: the early Christian con­verts did not come from in­tellec­tual circles. As such, they could hardly take on the theor­etical might of Graeco-Roman World, as Chadwick also pointed out: “Latin-speaking Christianity in the West did not acquire a philo­sophi­cal mind of any considerable quality before the middle of the fourth cen­tury, with the conver­sion of the Roman Neoplatonist Marius Victori­anus, to whose difficult and reput­edly obscure writ­ings Augustine was to owe a little in constructing his own syn­thesis of Christian­ity and Platonism.”[72]\nFor our purposes, Chadwick’s assessment is a side issue. The import­ant point is that the Christian religion, in its polemic with the Jews and pagans alike, counterposed its doctrines to the preva­lent customs. When such great store is set on beliefs, two things are inevitable: growth of different interpretations, and a critique of the tenability of these beliefs. The so-called ‘heresy’ is a phenomenon that grew along with Christianity itself.[73] Already dur­ing the first three hun­dred years of its existence, Christi­anity knew of the following heretic offshoots: Paulici­an­ism, Arianism, Montan­ism, Marcionism, Apollinarianism, Ori­gen­ism, Gnosti­cism, etc. Persecu­tion and liquidation are also the ineluc­table out­growths of such a reli­gion only when and where it is unable to show its strength against its intellectual op­ponents: Porphyry’s books were burnt;[74] heretics and others liqui­dated.\nBe that as it may, we are now in a better position to understand what was entailed by the Christian transformation of the pagan question. Christianity was ancient not because it was the practice of any nation but because of its doctrines.\nVIII\nHowever, as noted already, a problem comes to the fore: How could adherence to a doctrine be equivalent to following a practice? It would be, if the practice embodies or expresses the doctrine in question. That is to say, if the practice of the Christians expresses the teachings they accept; if the teachings they accept are “primitive, unique, and true”, it follows that their practices are also likewise. If the beliefs they held were ancient, so too were the practices which em­bodied them. This was the second move involved in countering religion to tradition.\nWith this in mind, if we look at either the Christian defense in the face of per­secu­tions during the first three centuries C.E.,[75] or if we look at their criticisms of ‘pagan­ism’ then and in the centuries to follow, at least one odd thing is striking. The criticisms were directed at pagan practices, but what were criticized were the pagan beliefs. As is well-known, criticisms of neither beliefs nor practices were new to the intellec­tuals from the Antiquity. In fact, the early (or late) Christian critique of paganism did not go much beyond the pagan critiques of their religio. The criti­cism of the Roman intel­lectuals, as has been noted already, did not challenge traditio; it merely restrained superstitio, i.e., it functioned as a con­straint on the excesses of human practice. The tradition han­ded down was not to be sup­planted by ‘reason’, but to be held in check when­ever practices threat­ened to run wild.\nWhat Christianity did then, and was to repeat the same feat centuries later during the Reformation, was to criticize practice by criti­ciz­ing beliefs. That is to say, it postulated a link between practices and beliefs of a type that was unknown in the Antiquity: prac­tices express or embody the beliefs that human beings entertain. In this manner, Christianity further re­duced religio to ‘religion’. The for­mer be­came a variant of the latter: paganism was an ex­pression of a set of false or cor­rupt beliefs.\nAs we have seen above, Christians claimed that their reli­gion fol­lowed the most antique of all doctrines. The Jews as well as all other nations on earth had anticipated the coming of Christ. By saying this, the Christians began the process of constructing the history of humanity itself. In appropriating the Old Testa­ment, they also appropriated the past of the humankind. The Old Testa­ment was not just the past of humanity as the Jews envisaged it, but a true chronicle of events on earth. The real or imaginary past of the Jews became the framework for describing the history of humanity itself.\nOf course, the Jews also treated the Old Testament as a histori­cal chronicle. With Christianity though, we see the emergence of an additional dimension: the coming of Christ in flesh gave a greater concreteness and deter­mination to human history; it was the fulfillment of God’s promise. As a result, a phil­osophy of history came into being too: not merely in the sense that chronicles which traced and rediscovered the truth of Biblical events on earth were penned,[76] but also in the sense that the Chris­tians experi­enced the worldly happen­ings as the execu­tion of the divine plan. ‘Human history’ supposedly embodied this divine plan.[77]\nWhat happened was not just an appropriation of the “past and the future” by the present. [78] Rather, it was an appropri­ation of the mul­tiple pasts and histories of peoples on earth within the frame­work of one past of one people. This single history exhibited an order and pattern because God’s promise was fulfilled in the present. In this process, the direction of the future was also clearly indicated. Let us tell the simplest version of a story that was to mas­querade as nothing short of human history. There was once a religion, the true and universal one, which was the divine gift to all hu­mankind. A sense or spark of divinity is installed in all races (and individ­uals) of humanity by the creator God himself. During the course of human history, this sense did not quite erode as it got corrupted. Idolatry, wor­ship of the Devil (i.e., of the false God and his min­ions) was to be the lot of human­kind until God spoke to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and led their tribe back onto the true path.\nFor our current purposes, two implications of this story are important. We have already come across the first: the ‘best’ among the pagans, by anticipating and preparing the advent of the Gospels, were now a part of the world history as the Christians wrote it. The second implication is this: within the broad framework of the Chris­tian (and Old Testa­ment) philosophy of history, the religiones of the Romans became manifestations of the false religions on earth. If this could be shown to be true, the Christian opposition between religion and tradition would begin to carry weight.\nIX\nHow could this be ‘demonstrated’? The Old Testament story was pressed into service here as well; not merely to explain the ‘errors’ of the gentiles but also to give them a permanent place within the Christian phi­los­ophy of history. The pagans were seduced into accepting false beliefs as true. Seduced by whom or what? By the Devil and his machinations, of course. The Devil and his minions tempt people into worshipping the false god. (After all, that is why the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob made His appearance in the Arabian Desert.) Conse­quently, the Roman deities were absorbed into the Christian frame­work as ‘demons’, and their worship was nothing but idolatry. From the innumer­able writings of the early Church fathers about this issue, a citation at random:\n“There are some insincere and vagrant spirits degraded from their heav­enly vigour by earthly stains and lusts. Now these spirits, after having lost the simplicity of their nature by being weighed down and immersed in vices, for a solace to their calamity, cease not, now that they have ruined themselves, to ruin others; and being depraved themselves, to infuse into others the error of their depravity; and being themselves alienated from God, to separate others from God by the introduction of degraded superstitions. The poets know that those spirits are demons; the philosophers discourse of them; Socrates knew it, who, at the nod and decision of a demon that was at his side, either declined or under­took affairs. The Magi, also, not only know that there are demons, but, moreover, whatever miracle they affect to perform, do it by means of demons; by their aspirations and communications they show their won­drous tricks, \u0026hellip;These impure spirits\u0026hellip;consecrated under statues and images, lurk there, and by their status attain the authority as of a pres­ent deity;\u0026hellip;Thus they weigh men downwards from heaven, and call them away from the true God\u0026hellip;and constrain men to worship them.”[79]\nThat is why, the Christians argued, it was of primordial importance to follow the true doctrines in matters of faith. The ‘antiquity’ of a practice, in most matters, cloaked erroneous doctrines and seduced men into travelling false paths. Therefore the antiquity of a custom was no authority in so far as religion was concerned. Consequently, all pagan cults with their multitude of practices, ceremonies and rituals, all these others, became mere exemplifications of another religion, viz., a false religion, which worship­ped the prince of dark­ness.\nIn so far as their doctrines were true, it also meant that the story of their scriptures was not mythical but factual. In turn, this implied that the pagan religio – which was at odds with Chris­tianity – was false: it merely expressed the false beliefs of the gentiles. That is why paganism was an expression of a set of false/corrupt beliefs.\nTo the pagans, as we have seen already, religio had to do with following ancient practices. The philosophers and the philosophical schools disputed about all kinds of doctrines: including the existence and nonexistence of gods, their nature, and so forth. Irrespective of such disputations (or even because of them), one contin­ued the traditional practices because of their fore­fathers. Variations in such ancestral customs among nations were not only recognized, but were also seen as inevitable, because they were human products. As Symmachus said so long ago, “\u0026hellip;quid interest qua quisque prudentia verum requirat? uno itinere non potest perveniri ad tam grande secretum”[80] (“What does it matter what practical system we adopt in our search for truth? Not by one avenue only can we arrive at so tremendous a secret”).\nIf religion has to do with practicing the true doctrine, then there can only be one avenue because there can only be one true doctrine. Everything that deviates from it can only be false. And that is what the Christians maintained.\nX\nWhen looked at this way, we can see something very un-Hellenic about the ‘Hellenization’ of Chris­tianity. Christianity and Judaism felt compelled to do what their religious rivals, viz., the cults never did. The pagan religions were also parts of the very same Hellenic milieu in which Christianity grew. Yet, it was the latter and not the pagan cults that developed a theology to justify practices. Pagans never felt compelled, even when under attack, to develop a theology of the Isis cult; a kerygma of the Sibylline oracles; or whatever else.\nTatian the Greek, when he became a Christian, did indeed “aspire to be above the Greeks”. His religion did what the pagans never thought of doing: inscribe ‘philosophical’ disputations (or theology) into the very heart of religious practice. Only thus, and no other way, could Christianity become a religion. To understand how the Christians were answering a transformed question, notice the well-known fact that no Greek or Roman thinker defended his theory on the grounds of its antiquity. Neither Plato nor Aristotle, leave alone lesser luminaries, ever suggested that their philosophical doctrine ought to be accepted because it was “ancient, most unique, and therefore true”. But the Christians, in their battle to establish themselves as religio did pre­cisely that.\nOne inevitable outcome of this transformation of the question is reflected in the parallel shift in both the reference and the meaning of the concept of ‘tradition’. By the time Christianity could carry bite, there were already disputes and discussions about the apostolic tradition itself. Here, ‘tradition’ referred to the line and process of transmission of the messages by the Apostolic Fathers. The Gnostic tendency within the Christian religion fed itself precisely on this pivotal issue: Was there a ‘truer’ doctrine, which the Apos­tolic Fathers entrusted only to a chosen few? Consequently, when one talks of the Catholic, Christian, or even the apostolic tradition,[81] the reference is to the transmission of some or another set of doctrines.\nThat a shift in the reference and meaning of religio also led to a similar movement with respect to traditio is a further indicator, we submit, of the fact that these terms were coextensive within the Roman milieu. It is the transformation of the pagan question which enabled the Christians to raise two further problems, which must have sounded like absolute nonsense to the pagan ears: Is your reli­gio true? Is your traditio true? Using an anachronistic example and terminology, we can try to understand how Christians would have shocked the pagan sensibilities. In effect, this is our example, the Christians asked, ‘Do green ideas sleep furiously?’ That is, and this is our terminology, they were committing a fundamental category mistake. A pagan could understand the question: Are you faithfully following your ancestral practice? But no pagan could answer the charge that his ancestral practice itself was false. How could tradi­tion be true or false? Nei­ther of these two predicates is applicable to traditio or religio. But that the Christians neverthe­less thought so, after having absorbed the pagan ‘other’ into a Christian philosophy of history, surely tell us of the gulf separating the pagan world from the Christian one.\nXI\nLet us summarize this long article and, in doing so, return to the concerns that were expressed at the beginning. In the pagan milieu of ancient Roman culture and in the pagan milieus of today’s world, similar ideas carry weight: traditions live on because they are sanctioned by ancestral practices. The Romans called it ‘religio’ and the Indians and the Chinese use different terms from different languages for the same. The reason to practice a tradition lies in its nature: something is practiced because it is a tradition. Most of our contemporary notions of ‘religion’ need to use the notion ‘doctrines’, when speaking about Indian and Chinese traditions. This, we would submit, is a Christian understanding of what ‘religion’ is. Such notions make human practices into expressions of beliefs and imply that religions are candidates for truth values. This too is a Christian inheritance. The claim that Christianity makes with respect to its ‘antiquity’ lives on today, we would submit, in the unproven assertion that, in all known cultures and all known human communities, religion has always existed. As far as the pagans are concerned, whether of yesteryears or today, the way Christianity opposed a tradition of a people in order to become the ‘religion of humankind’ remains a category mistake. While we believe each of these points has enormous ramifications for the future of religious studies, analyzing these will have to wait for other times and other places.\n[1] However, see the following two books, which capture the nature of the debates between Christianity and the pagan cultures, Japan and India, for example.

Benko (1980, 1064) notes that the hatred of the human race (odium humanis generis) with which Tacitus charges the Christians is nearly the same expression previously used to describe the Jews in Histories. Therefore, argues Benko, the great fire in Rome was not the main cause of the persecution. Rather, the cause resided in the anti-social tendencies displayed by the Christians – in their odium humanis generis, to which also Celsus and Caecilius referred. However, much like Celsus, Tacitus clearly mentions that the Jews were vindicated, regardless of their hatred for mankind. The Jews, too, separated themselves from the rest of humanity and refused to participate in Roman practices. Yet, the Jews had a tradition of not taking part in such practices and were, so to speak, ‘licensed atheists’ (see de Ste. Croix, “Why were the Early Christians Prosecuted?,” 25).

This is the move ‘away’ for unhappiness that all of us aim at, namely, to be ‘less unhappy’. After a period of time, many of us would like to move further. This is the move ‘towards’ (peace of mind, contentment, satisfied, etc.) happiness now formulated in positive terms: the phase of secondary education. The completion of this process is to reach a state of peace (shanti), or contentment (samadhana), or satisfaction (trupti) etc. The Sri Sri’s and the Sadguru’s of this world help us here through their Sudarshan Kriya’s, their yogic practices, their meditative courses and so on. The vipassana meditation, the Satsangh’s, the bhajans, the dhyaanas etc. are also situated here. Some people in this phase also call themselves Saadhakas, doing their ‘saadhana’ on a very regular basis. Suppose that you want to go further and, therefore, seek higher education (call it Ananda, or happiness). There are two broad routes here: technical or vocational education is one route; university education is another. If you want to be plumber, a carpenter, a sculptor, a painter, a machinist…then you are better-off choosing technical education. However, you could also go for a university education. There is no ‘higher’ or ‘lower’ here; both are different forms of higher education. (Of course, there are endless discussions about ‘superiority’: one group disparagingly calls the other ‘vocational training’, while the other caricatures the first as ‘purely theoretical’ that is unsuited for fulfilling the ‘need’ for useful education or the ‘needs’ of society.) A society cannot survive without plumbers, electricians, machinists, artists, etc. Nor can it live without the ‘ivory tower’ that universities are and should be. Individual students make their choice based on multiple reasons (from aptitude to financial rewards) and many gifted teachers prefer to teach in vocational or professional schools than in a university. However, whatever the choice, both demand that the student specifies clearly what s/he wants to learn: do you want to be a sculptor or a machinist; in which subject do you want your bachelor and Master’s degree? ‘Ananda’, the generic word, does not suffice here because it merely picks out ‘higher education’: do you want to do physics or chemistry or biology or English literature at the university? ‘Gyaana marga’ (the university) on the one hand and ‘other routes’ (vocational and professional training) on the other hand are the main avenues in higher education. Within the framework of this imagery, ‘enlightenment’ refers to the total process of ‘higher education’ and ‘seeking ananda’ fixes the goal of higher education. Each avenue has its way of classifying its internal levels or divisions (Bachelors, Masters, Doctoral, Post-doctoral in the university, for example) and teaches students accordingly. They share many commonalities: the subject matter, the instruments, the theoretical frameworks, etc. etc. They are also different from each other in ways of teaching, investigating, making and reporting discoveries, and so on. The names of some teachers in higher education are known to us: Buddha, Shankara, Ramanuja, Madhva, Vallabha, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, Ramana, Nisargadatta Maharaj, etc. Let us not deal with the question whether they taught at the University or were active in professional or technical education because something else of greater importance has to be noticed: you have to choose the ‘subject’ of higher education first. ‘Seeking Happiness’ or ‘wanting enlightenment’ are not adequate at all. You need to specifiy what you are seeking and, preferably, why.\nOur past makes things very difficult for us precisely here. These difficulties are many: for instance, there is reticence, reservation and , yes, even embarrassment. ‘I want to be a physicist’ comes naturally; ‘I want to be an atmagyaani’ does not come out at all; ‘I want to be a painter’ is OK, not at all OK when you say ’I seek the Buddhahood’. To many, this problem emerges at the earlier stage itself: it is very difficult even to say ‘I seek enlightenment’ or ‘my goal is to seek Ananda’. Saying such things openly is simply ‘not done’: it is almost equivalent to confessing to a pornographic fantasy or to a ‘dirty’ dream in public. There are multiple reasons for this tragic state of affairs; one such is the puerile, pernicious and pubertal idea about what ‘enlightenment’ is alleged to be and what it is supposed to do. Here is one thumbnail sketch of one such image. The ‘enlightened’ ones are some kind of ‘special’ people: exceptional, privileged and, in many senses; ‘super-human’. They are not given to anger or sorrow; they are ‘altruistic’ in some extraordinary way (no ‘ahankaara’ at all, for instance); they are always beatific, profound and wise; they are always calm and collected, deeply insightful and see things that ordinary mortals cannot. As paragons of all virtues, they fully control all biological urges, including the sexual urge. They are ‘the chosen’. (The secret pornographic dream is the vague conviction that one also belongs to ‘the chosen’; however, it is camouflaged by the false but open declaration of modesty: one is a mere ‘saadhaka’, for more than a decade, busy doing the ‘saadhana’ that some or another guru taught; no ‘truly enlightened’ ever says that s/he is enlightened; so on and so forth.) One can only seek enlightenment (secretly) if one is enveloped in ‘Shama, ‘Dama’, ‘Karuna’, and all such ‘virtues’. Not otherwise. Such an image simply paralyses the brain because it forbids us from asking the most simple and a very elementary question: which human being is ever capable of reaching such a state? If you know even elementary science, you know that this is an impossible state to be in. It is biologically, sociologically, psychologically, cognitively impossible for human beings to be in such a state. Surely, it is logically possible, but, at times, it is even physically (leave alone biologically) impossible. If ‘enlightenment’ is supposed to be that kind of state, we need to be ‘Super-Natural’ entities to go there. In short: this image short-circuits the goal, which is its foundation, namely, human beings can be enlightened and that it is a desirable goal. Though extremely important, let us not go into the ‘why’ of this image. Instead, let us ask another simpler question: do the Indian traditions countenance such puerile ideas? Is enlightenment akin to puberal fantasies about sex? In the Chandogya Upanishad, there is a very famous dialogue that begins this way: “The Self (Atman), …is free from evil, ageless, deathless, sorrowless, hungerless, thirstless…He should be searched out, Him one should desire to understand. He obtains all worlds and all desires who has found out and who understands that Self.\u0026rsquo;\u0026ndash;Thus spake Prajapati. Then both the gods and the devils (deva-asura) heard it. Then they said: ’Come! Let us search out that…by searching out whom one obtains all worlds and all desires!’”\nVirochana and Indra then go to Parjapati, works for him free (without receiving any wages, one presumes) for 32 years. At the end of that time period, Prajapati asks them what they desire. They answer:‘ “The Self (Atman), which is free from evil, ageless, deathless, sorrowless, hungerless, thirstless…He should be searched out, Him one should desire to understand. He obtains all worlds and all desires who has found out and who understands that Self.\u0026quot;\u0026ndash;Such do people declare to be your words, Sir. We have been living desiringHim.\u0026rsquo; The story continues further, but let us leave it here.\nNotice the following important fact in the above dialogue: Indra and Virochana want to “obtain all worlds and satisfy all desires”. This is not only a worldly goal but it is also the wet dream of those who think thus: ‘who does not want to obtain all worlds and have all his desires satisfied?’ Desiring to achieve such an ‘extremely’ materialistic goal, Indra and Virochana approach Prajapati. The latter sells ‘Atman’ as the only way to completely satisfy all lusts, including carnal lusts. Prajapati teaches ‘adhyatma’ to fulfil the goal of fully satisfying these worldly, materialistic and carnal desires. (One is frustrated if these desires and lusts are not fully but only partially satisfied, of course.) He sells ‘adhyatma’ to enable people to reach this goal of complete satisfaction of worldly desires and does not reproach Indra or Virochana for seeking such materialistic goals. Instead, he approves such a pursuit and teaches ‘Atman’ to them. That is, he teaches ‘enlightenment’ to them because it is the best and only way to satisfy all our desires and wants. (The puerile image would probably understand it as the ‘total disappearance’ of all such desires. It is, of course, unclear which desires disappear: does the desire for ‘atman’ disappear as well? A modern day Maslow enthusiast would have no problem in saying that such is indeed the case with ‘deficiency needs’.)\nThe contrast between our image of ‘enlightenment’ (and ‘Atmagyaana’) and how this Upanishad deals with the same issue cannot be starker and sharper. Our image tells us that we must give up our worldly desires, embody all kinds of virtues and practice asceticism seriously and earnestly and smile beatifically (and perhaps even levitate), if we seek ‘Atmagyaana’. But here is Prajapati, coolly preaching and accepting the opposite. No shama, dama, karuna, or anything of that sort. No altruism of any kind; the utter ‘selfishness’ of wanting to satisfy all of one’s desires is the most legitimate goal.\nThink this issue seriously through and ask yourself what ‘enlightenment’ could then be about. Why is this dialogue so very famous and, yet, its structure hardly understood or commented upon? Prajapati offers more than the proverbial “philospher’s stone”: he offersa magical wand to completely satisfy worldly desires! Worldly desires should not be cast aside, apparently; instead, they should be very earnestly pursued. Thus: What do you want? Atmagyaana, say. Why do you want it? To fully and completely satisfy all of one’s worldly desires. Wow, (awesome!), as the Americans say.\nIn the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, the sage Yagnavalkya decides, on his deathbed, to distribute his wealth to his two wives. Speaking to Maitreyi about it results in one of the most famous discourses on ‘Atman’. Hearing of this decision to divide the land, his wife asks him whether that would make her ‘immortal’ (overcome death). When Yagnavalkya says ‘no’ to her question, her reply tells us why she seeks immortality: what is the point of possessing wealth, if one cannot enjoy it in perpetuity or forever? What can one do with it (kim ahaṁ tena kuryām=what can I do with it)? Yangnavalkya answers this question at length. The first long passage discourses about why things are desired, whether husbands or wives or sons or the worlds, etc. Each of the items desired, he says, are ‘loved’ not because the object is loved but because of the desire for ‘Atman’. The sentence structure is: “na vā are…(husbands, wives, sons, worlds,….) kāmāya…(the item named) priyo bhavati, ātmanas tu kāmāya…(item named)… priyo bhavati. (Kāmāya=because of desiring; priyo bhavati=becomes loved.) How does one understand these multiple sentences? One route, the most famous and perhaps the only route known to us so far, is to make ‘Atman’ into an object that is different from the named items (husbands, wives, etc.). Consider one such rendering: “not for desiring ( kāmāya) the husband is a husband loved (priya), but for desiring (kāmāya) the Soul (Atman) is a husband dear (priya)”. This rendering leads to the understanding ‘Atman’, for example, in the following way: “For the desire of the Infinite, which is the Self, everything appears to be desirable. Here, the word ātman is to be understood in the sense of the Totality of Being. It is the Selfhood of all beings…” (http://www.swami-krishnananda.org/brdup/brhad_II-04.html) The structure of thought behind such a rendering is all too familiar to us. Most probably, all of us have read ‘Atman’ as some kind of an entity that we ‘really’ should seek and that we confuse this entity with objects in the world. Only this ‘Atman’ will give us the happiness we all seek. Of course, from this follows the idea that we should not seek happiness in ‘material’ things but in ‘Atman’. If we replace ‘Atman’ by the word ‘God’, we get the following: we all seek ‘God’ but do so mistakenly in ‘material things’. Complete happiness is not to be found here on Earth but in God, “the Totality of Being”. As our learned Swamiji puts it: “the desire of the mind for a particular desirable object is a desire to get united with that object in its being”. Thus, this union, which is impossible with any given object in the world, is possible uniquely with ‘God’, whom we all seek. Thus ‘atman’ is the essence or the foundation or the ground or the totality of all beings, of the world and of existence itself. This is what we all seek.\nConsider this question, provided you are honest with yourself: why do you have difficulty in understanding this claim? What the devil does ‘union’ with an object, any object, or with the ‘being and the totality of being’ etc. mean? When you want that million dollars or that beautiful Porsche, or that marvellous painting or that sexy person, are you seeking to become ‘one’ (seeking the ‘union’) with that million dollars, that Porsche, that painting or that sexy person? What is ‘the totality’ of their ‘being’ that you seek? (Consider what your answer has to do: if you ‘desire’ that your son has a good education, satisfaction of that desire would mean you have ‘united’ with that education and with ‘the totality of the being’ of that good education.) If you cannot answer this question to yourself, how could a housewife (Maitreyi is a housewife), who does not have the education and the consequent mental development that you have, understand her husband at all? If this heavy-duty ‘spiritual stuff’ is impenetrable to your mind, how could it be ‘crystal clear’ to a woman nearly four thousand years ago? The probability is very high that she did not even know how to read and write; she could not have been a trained philosopher or scientist; she would not have known any mathematics or logic; she would not have heard of ontology or the metaphysics of being…How, in heaven’s name, could she ever understand this discourse on ‘Atman’, when even we cannot figure out what our learned Swamiji is saying in his very extended commentary on the subject? Surely, “there is something rotten in the state of Denmark…”\nHere is one possible route, which solves these problems in a simple and obvious way. It consists of not looking at ‘atman’ as an object of desire at all: ‘ātmanas tu kāmāya’ is best understood (in modern English) as ‘for the sake of oneself’ or ‘for the sake of one’s own self’ or even ‘desire of oneself’: “not for desiring (kāmāya) the husband is a husband loved (priya), but because oneself desires (kāmāya) is a husband dear (priya)”. In its simplest form, using a language that we all can use in daily life: the objects are loved not because they are desired (for their own sake) but because one desires them. I love that million dollars because I desire it; I love that Porsche because I desire it; I love that painting because I desire it; I love that sexy person because I desire it… ‘You love things because you desire them’. Period. Then, because you love things in the world only because you desire them, it is extremely important to know who you are. Since I do things in the world because I desire them and they are dear to me because I hold them dear, it is extremely important to know who I am, is it not? (I might love my wife for any number of reasons, or for no known reason at all, but she is dear to me and she remains dear to me independent of whatever she is to anyone else in the world: she is dear to me because I desire her.) This appears as an extraordinarily crude form of ‘egoism’ or ‘selfishness’. It is. However, what you think of both (‘egoism’ and ‘selfishness’) depends very much on what you think ‘ego’ is and what that ‘self’ is. If every one of us has a unique ‘ego’ or a unique ‘self’, where each of these has its own unique sets of desires, passions and goals, then, indeed, this is the crudest form of ‘selfishness’ and ‘egoism’ that one could think of. If each of us has this unique ‘soul’, then, yes, this is ‘ethical egoism’ in its worst form. What, however, if we do not have such unique selves? What, if this ‘self’ is not ‘the soul’? What, if the Upanishadic claim is true, namely, that ‘atma gyaana’ is knowledge about this ‘self’ (of yours, mine, and so on)? What, if this ‘I’ (that we all have) cannot be individuated at all?\nMaitreyi would then understand without any education of any kind: things are important to her only because she (herself) desires them; her husband says, therefore, Maitreyi, understand yourself, who you are. ‘Know thyself’ is to ‘know thy self’: what is this ‘self’? A unique soul or something that cannot be individuated? Do each of us have a ‘unique self’ or is this ‘I’ that we all have is not a unique and individuated entity? Here is where a choice has to be made: does ‘ātmanas tu kāmāya’ mean ‘desiring the Atman’ (as an object) or not? This is not a grammatical or a translation issue; the question is already answered by how ‘atman’ is understood, which defines how one translates and how one uses grammar. ‘By desiring oneself’ can either mean “by desiring the ‘oneself’ (Atman)” or it could mean (in an expanded form, and keeping to how we use the English language) something like some object is loved by one ‘because one has desired it oneself’. Under this second interpretation, which appears to be the most understandable to someone like Maitreyi, the normal attitude of almost all people at all times and in all cultures becomes foundational to raise the issue of ‘atmagyaana’: who am ‘I’ that desires these objects?\nThese two Upanishads, each in its own way, completely undercut the images we have of enlightenment today. Neither suggests that we have to become ‘Super-Natural’ or lose our ‘base’ emotions or become recluses or renounce ‘the world’, or be ‘the chosen’ to seek or find enlightenment. They take our daily experiences as the source and the drive for the quest for enlightenment. Why is it, then, that this route has not been pursued, or if it has been, not available to us? The hypothesis about ‘colonial consciousness’ provides one avenue for investigating this question: colonialism has damaged the transmission of our culture. To appreciate this idea better, consider your own possible resistances to the simple route taken by the previous point. Surely, Maiteryi, as a rishi’s wife, was very, very knowledgeable and not a simple housewife? Surely, those days they ‘knew’ all these things (like atman etc.) as matters of daily concerns? Surely, the culture of that time was more advanced and sophisticated than ours, spiritually? Surely, it is this degeneration that makes us want to seek their ‘deep’ and ‘profound’ knowledge? What we have lost, surely, is this ‘ancient wisdom’ of our rishis? And so on. (These reflections that hinder the simple route also block other obvious questions: how could Maitreyi seek the secret of ‘immortality’ from her dying husband? If he knew that secret well enough to teach it, why did the bugger die and not live on forever?) The damage to the transmission of our culture (that the two colonialisms have wrought on our culture) has other consequences as well, two of which are important to notice in this context. Let us bring this story back to the image of higher education to understand these better. The first is this: we cannot assess the nature of the texts adequately. What kinds of texts do we have? Is the Gita an essay, a textbook, a thesis, a theory, a compendium, a ‘metaphysics for the dummies’, a popularising discourse…? If it is textbook, say, of what kind: a secondary school textbook, or something like Feynman’s Lectures on Physics, or like Schaum’ s outline series…? What about the Upanishads? Random teachings strung together as individual Upanishads? How is each ‘discourse’ related to the other: chronologically, theoretically, conceptually, thematically…? What about the Brahma Sutra? Is it one text, authored by one individual? Or compilation of various statements made by people over centuries? Is each sutra in the text a complete sutra with ‘deep’ and ‘profound’ connotations? Are there fragments and words, each masquerading as an independent Sutra? And so on and so forth. Every answer to these questions is, more or less, also a complete answer. Consider a second consequence with the help of an analogy. Let us assume that the writings of Democritus are available to us today. Let us also say that Rutherford’s planetary model is also accessible to us. However, the works of Dalton, Avogadro etc. are not accessible. How would we construct the developmental story about the atoms? A straight line would be drawn between Democritus and Rutherford and, in the absence of other texts and chronology, we would plot a predecessor, successor relationship between them. Assume that someone discovers the text about Avogadro’s hypothesis later. That person would say that Avogadro and Rutherford were each other’s rivals: one speaks about atoms and the other about molecules as the basic building blocks of matter, such a person would say. In this story, Chemistry (Avogadro) becomes the rival of Physics (Is Rutherford, a chemist or a physicist? Is his model a part of chemistry or a hypothesis in physics?): they become antagonistic tendencies, competing with each other. (Our science history tells us a different story, of course.) The dating (Democritus to Rutherford) is false; the conflict (between Avogadro and Rutherford) is spurious; but this becomes ‘the history’ of western culture and its science. However, these claims acquire the mantle of authority because of ‘who’ said them (which ‘authority’) first and how often they get repeated. How do we know that this is not the case with the so-called Indian history? Is the alleged rivalry between ‘Brahmanism’ and ‘Buddhism’ something like the spurious conflict between Avogadro and Rutherford? Is the ‘astika’ and the ‘nastika’ divide or the ‘Vedantic’ and ‘Nastika’ conflict something akin to the imaginary story about Chemistry and Physics? (The difference between Democritus and Rutherford can be seen either the way Gaudapada relates to Shankara or the way of Advaita is related to the Upanishads.) Every silly answer to these questions is satisfactory because some or another ‘authority’ says that such is the case and others repeat it after him. How to settle these issues? Surely, these are all knowledge questions and can be settled only by discovering how and in what sense ‘gyaana’ can mean knowledge at all. And the question of what knowledge is, then, cannot become a definitional or stipulative issue about how we use the word ‘gyaana’ or ‘knowledge’. Instead, it is a question about the nature and structure of knowledge which is itself a knowledge question. This is where ‘gyaana marga’ comes into the picture. However, as noted before, ‘gyaana marga’, which some seek, is merely one avenue. Others seek different routes. Most, however, do not want to go beyond seeking peace of mind, contentment, satisfaction in life. In terms of the higher education analogy, not everyone seeks higher education. Even in the modern day world, not seeking higher education is not an ‘inferior’ way of living: one could finish secondary education and want to become a farmer; or run the family business (from shopkeepers through butchers to running a small scale industry) and so on. In terms of desires, it could be formulated in this fashion: most people do not desire all the wealth in the world or all the three worlds; they do not seek to sleep with all the women in the world nor father all the children in the world. Most would like to be content with what they have: some wealth, some goods, one wife, two children, one car\u0026hellip;They do not seek nor do they desire ‘more’ than this: surely, there is nothing ‘inferior’ to this way of living. These people would then be quite happy with secondary education (say, doing some kriya, yoga, bhajans, meditation of some kind, etc.). In short, they do not seek enlightenment; they do not desire it; they are happy with what they have. There is nothing wrong or inferior about this choice. Remember that Indra and Virochana wanted to “obtain all worlds and all desires” and Maitreyi wanted to enjoy her land forever and in perpetuity. Most people on earth do not want to “obtain all worlds and all desires” but are content with very, very limited portions of both. By the same token, if you desire ‘more’ than what most seek and want to “obtain all worlds and all desires”, you need higher education. However, unless you are able to choose what you want to learn and thus know the reason why, you cannot pursue higher education. Enlightenment is not possible if you cannot say what you want and why. This general requirement becomes stricter, if you want to pursue your higher education at the university. To get the Master’s, you have narrow your choice after your Bachelors. It narrows down even further if you want to do doctoral research. In exactly the same way, you cannot ‘vaguely’ and ‘secretly’ seek enlightenment or happiness. If there is no progressive narrowing down of the goal or your want, it is simply impossible to pursue higher education of any kind.\nRemember, however, that mere ‘hard work’ does not suffice to get through the University. You need to work hard to learn the subject that you want to learn. You need to bend your back learning whatever it is that you want to learn. In exactly the same way you cannot learn quantum physics through e-mail conversations, you cannot get enlightened through e-mail exchanges. Glancing casually through some or another text, citing some sentences and using some words will not give you knowledge of quantum physics. The same conditions apply here also: citing some or another ‘gyaani’, using some or another word (‘Arivinalli niluvu’ or ‘Atman’) is not knowledge of any kind. To the extent you present it that way, you bullshit. In any case, you will not understand anything about enlightenment nor will you ever be enlightened.\nzrp:le3\n","tags":[],"title":"Colonial Consciousness and Enlightenment","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/colonial-consciousness-and-enlightenment/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","basics","God, Satan(Devil)","translation","erudition"],"content":"Here is the question: How would one translate the word \u0026lsquo;God\u0026rsquo; into, say, Sanskrit? Now, the answer has to satisfy certain conditions because the question also meets certain conditions. Let me say very clearly what all these are, so that the playground and the rules are transparent and favour no one party in the dispute.\nI propose we accept the best theory of meaning that exists in the market place. As far as I know, the book that plays this role most admirably, while satisfying the proponents of different theories of meaning expounded during the last century or so, is Prashant Parikh\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Language and Equilibrium\u0026rdquo; (The MIT press, 2010). His formal apparatus allows for the existence of \u0026lsquo;word meanings\u0026rsquo; without sacrificing the idea that the meaning of sentences are context-dependent and makes sense of even such statements as \u0026ldquo;the meaning of red light is\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; That is to say, it does not restrict \u0026lsquo;meaning\u0026rsquo; to words and sentences alone; it also allows us to deal with \u0026lsquo;word meaning\u0026rsquo; as well, as it is in our case. If my colleagues unanimously prefer another \u0026rsquo;theory of meaning\u0026rsquo;, I would like to know what it is. In all probability, I would not take issue with an alternate choice.\nThe Indian cognate of the word \u0026lsquo;God\u0026rsquo; must also satisfy the use and meaning of the words \u0026rsquo;theos\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;Deus\u0026rsquo;. This is an obvious condition because the Greek and Latin words are at the origin of the meaning of the English word.\nThis Sanskrit word should be capable of being used sensibly in all those contexts where \u0026lsquo;God\u0026rsquo; has been used, primarily (a) by Catholic theologians during the last two millennia; (b) by the Protestant theologians since the Reformation. That is to say, the Sanskrit word should generate the same well-formed sentences (both syntactically and semantically) that \u0026lsquo;God\u0026rsquo; produces. If it does not, obviously, it cannot be a cognate.\nThe Sanskrit word cannot have a purely stipulative meaning. That is to say, it cannot be a word with only a technical meaning that an individual author stipulates. Such a stipulation would then be a part of some or another theory where a word has been \u0026ldquo;defined\u0026rdquo; in some particular way. It must satisfy the condition that it has a \u0026lsquo;word meaning\u0026rsquo;, i.e., it be well-known and used in the literature very frequently, the way \u0026lsquo;God\u0026rsquo; is used in English.\nThis word must be used in the same sense that \u0026lsquo;God\u0026rsquo; is used by Christian theologians of all persuasions in the course of the last two millennia. That is to say, (A) we must make sense of, say, Shankara and Ramanuja using this Sanskrit equivalent for \u0026lsquo;God\u0026rsquo; the way, say, we can use \u0026lsquo;God\u0026rsquo; to make sense of Aquinas and Luther. Not only that. (B) This word should also make sense of the writings of these four as well. If people really do believe that these two Christian thinkers used \u0026lsquo;God\u0026rsquo; in entirely differing senses, I want references and explications of these so-called \u0026lsquo;astonishingly different meanings\u0026rsquo;. This would imply that the Christian \u0026lsquo;God\u0026rsquo; of Aquinas and of Luther are different entities. And that would, indeed, be a result worth writing about.\nSimply suggesting that words like \u0026lsquo;Ishvara\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;Brahma\u0026rsquo; and such like do the job is an inadmissible move for the simple reason that this is what the dispute is about. Nor is an argument from authority (Thinker \u0026lsquo;X\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;Y\u0026rsquo; used it) acceptable because it is a fallacy in informal logic to use that as an argument.\nOne requires arguments for proposing a Sanskrit equivalent. I shall leave it to the competence of my colleagues to choose the arguments they find fit. However, they will be scrutinized for logical and linguistic consistency.\nThe time limit for this exercise, I suggest, be set to 24 hours. This should be more than ample because my colleagues have repeatedly said that Indologists have been thinking about this problem for more than a century now and have suggested that my students are not aware of this gigantic work. I am willing to buy this claim, if people are able to satisfy the above conditions at the snap of their fingers, in a manner of speaking. However, if my colleagues want a different time limit, I am willing to accept any reasonable suggestion.\nI am willing too to accept other reasonable conditions, if my colleagues formulate them with reasonable arguments and on reasonable grounds.\nIf these or even other reasonable conditions (that could be proposed) are met, I will personally withdraw some of the claims I have been proposing and defending for a long time now. This is a huge concession because I am wagering my intellectual work of decades on the collective ability of my colleagues to translate just one word. In return, what are my colleagues willing to stake?\nI very much look forward to an exhibition of erudition (references to writers) translating itself into arguments that meet the challenge I throw down. Let us see how many of us, as the Americans say, either put up or shut up.\nComments Arun — 2017-10-02 19:31:00\nCondition 5A seems a little unreasonable. Shankara and Ramanuja may not have talked about God at all; but that logically does not preclude there being a Sanskrit word for God satisfying all the other conditions, in which case it might be obscure.\nArun — 2017-10-02 19:45:00\nI suggest going through Vishnu-sahasranam, and dividing the names into what could apply to the God of Aquinas and Luther, and what cannot apply. E.g, sarvajna - omniscient - might apply; Krishna - dark complexioned does not; any name that uses dharma or karma does not, and so on.\nWiki has a list of the thousand names: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vishnu_sahasranama\nSK — 2017-10-26 01:26:00\nMay I know which discussion the above post is from? Did anyone take up the challenge?\n","tags":[],"title":"How would one translate the word 'God' into, say, Sanskrit?","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/how-would-one-translate-the-word-god-into-sanskrit/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","basics","normative"],"content":"This one begins to reflect about the principle of charity in relationship to the current US President, Donald Trump (from now on, Trump).\nAs you might know, the principle of charity has been formulated in different ways by different people. (Even the first page of a google search of the word ‘principle of charity’ allows you to access many of these documents quickly.) This post will stick strictly to your formulation: “a principle of charity says that (like the rain dance) a long-standing practice should not be attributed to idiocy without strong evidence”. This formulation itself will not be questioned but assumed as a given. The only evidence used in this post is an extremely fragmentary viewing of the CNN and the BBC World coverages of Trump during the last week or so. (No thorough viewing of either of the two channels is claimed; the references in this post merely pick out fragments from programs as memory ‘recalls’ them today.) Two dramatis personae: Some media coverage and the event of Trump presidency; one question: what does the principle of charity do or advocate in the following cases? Such cases can be indefinitely multiplied but it is restricted here to five. One side of the argument is presented briefly only because that side of the argument is in wide circulation.\nTo begin with the first three press briefings by the new press secretary. (Watched: the last three or minutes of the first; nearly 55 minutes of the second and a fragment of an answer from the third; some fragments from some CNN commentaries of the first two, a fragmentary watching of the BBC World and three news clips and commentaries from the Flemish Televisions about the third. Read: many pieces from the NYT.) The focus here is on one issue that has received much coverage: the size of the crowd during Trump’s inauguration. The ‘takeaway’, as the Americans so disgustingly put it, from all of these is: Trump lied; the Press secretary defended both his first speech and his boss rather ineptly, while underhandedly admitting to telling lies or half-truths. The press secretary repeatedly claimed the following: in his first speech, he had said that the audience numbers referred to the sum ofpeople present in person and the viewers watching the inauguration. It was the highest ever in any inauguration. (In the second Press briefing, he also read out the sentence he used during the first briefing and no one challenged it.) The reporters kept pushing their point and the press secretary kept giving the same answer, while repeatedly drawing attention to the fact that he had already answered it. The ‘facts’ and the aerial picture of two presidential inaugurations were constantly in the background, when discussions began on the TV channels. Assuming that the long-standing practice is that neither the press secretary nor the President lies and that the Press reports the truth, what does the principle of charity recommend?\nOne route: The Press should check facts and report them as they are. Because of the ‘strong evidence’ (photographs, metro numbers, empty spaces, etc.), it concludes that the White House lies. (Reports about Trump’s past appear as further corroborating evidence; the conclusion is that he lies, bluffs and is obsessed by ratings and popularity.)\nThe other route: Neither Trump nor the Press secretary has ever stood in front of such a gathering. ‘Faces as far as the eyes could see’, ‘awesome’, etc. as the Press secretary said repeatedly. Thereafter, both Trump and the press secretary receive the audience number (including those present in person and the TV viewers). This number appears to corroborate their extraordinary and, possibly, unforgettable experience. ‘The biggest audience ever’ is, in this sense, a perfectly reasonable and a completely honest claim. Even if it turns out to be wrong at a later point in time, Trump and the press secretary are entirely justified in believing that this was the biggest audience for a presidential inauguration. As of now, there are no confirmed and verified numbers available to the public that suggests to the contrary. Assuming the long-standing tradition that the presidential office does not lie to the press, the conclusion is that they are telling the truth they know. Further, because one cannot tell a truth that one does not know and, to the best of their knowledge, this is what they think is true, and because we do not know how many people watched the event, the Press should retract its statement about Trump and his lies.\nThe principle of charity ‘recommends’ both routes unequivocally. Which route should we, from the ‘outside’, take? Neutrality (‘I do not know’, ‘insufficient information’, etc.) is not a possible option when using the principle of charity.\nAbout the inaugural speech (watched: about 6 TV stations and multiple commentators; read: some NYT pieces). Every commentator repeated the same line: campaign rhetoric, non-presidential, no policy statements, etc. Normally speaking, the President reaffirms his campaign pledges during his speech, and formulates them as his policy to the nation at large. One route: the long-standing practice (excepting Jackson, apparently) is that a presidential inaugural speech tries to unite the nation; it lays out in the broadest outline the noble ideals of the incoming president; affirms and acknowledges existing friends, allies and treaties, etc. Every single line in that short speech was an evidence to the contrary; instead of inducing hope, it presented a bleak picture of the nation. The principle of charity demands attribution of precisely those properties which these commentators used. Trump has no policies of any kind and is polarising the nation even further.\nThe other route: the election speech demonstrated an extraordinary consistency. Trump reaffirmed what he had said throughout the campaign. He laid out his policy in very simple, understandable and unequivocal terms: trade with other nations will be bi-lateral and not multi-lateral; making deals with individual nations is the modus operandi, which is possible only if both nations benefit (otherwise, there could be no deals); foreign policy of the US will be defined purely in terms of strengthening the nation; thus, no playing the ‘policeman’ of the world or hide imperial ambitions by speaking in terms of ‘protecting American interests’; no wars and wanton destructions of other peoples and nations elsewhere in the world, while trying to protect ‘their borders’, etc. Trump said all these, reaffirmed his promise to the American people, down to using the same language. He did even better by repeating his pledges more or less in the same way he made them while seeking votes. His election words were not meant to merely attract votes; he repeats them even after becoming the president. No evidence of any kind to suspect that Trump was violating the long-standing practice. Thus, obviously, his speech was genuine and honest. His policy repeated the word he gave to the American people.\nAgain: the principle of charity ‘recommends’ both routes unequivocally. Which route should we, from the ‘outside’, take? Neutrality is once again impossible.\nNomination for the secretary of state: an Exxon Mobil CEO. One route: The nominee has corporate interests at heart, is friendly with Putin and Putin’s Russia, has no diplomatic or political experience, and is singularly unqualified to promote US interests, etc. Trump chooses corporate America to run and represent the nation. All are expressions of bad faith because sectional interests (the corporate interests) are promoted by disguising them as the general interest (of the nation).\nThe other route (also partially presented by the White House Chief of Staff on the CNN): has experience in dealing with many nations; has fairly good, working knowledge of international law; has dealt with many foreign governments; knows how to close deals with high-placed political figures; will pursue the interests of the nation with the same zeal he pursued corporate interests; is willing to give up a lucrative career for the sake of serving the nation. One could add: what precisely are the special ‘skills’ and ‘abilities’ that Colin Powell, Condoleezza Rice, Hillary Clinton, John Kerry, etc. possessed that qualified them to become secretariesof the state? Leading an army, being a diplomat, being a senator or being elected by popular votes do not magically and automatically provide an individual with those special skills and abilities that a secretary of state should have. What are those special skills and abilities anyway? Besides, if the American and European idea about running the government as an efficient business organization is true (‘good governance’, ‘corporate governance’, etc.), the Exxon CEO would be the best choice for the post.\nThe long-standing practice is to name a capable person as the secretary of the state, someone who can best represent and defend the US abroad.The principle of charity recommends both routes unequivocally. Again, which to choose?\nSenate hearings regarding the above nomination. Marc Rubio questions the CEO, among other things, about Putin’s status as a war criminal. The nominee says that he does not have sufficient information to make a judgement on the issue; the Senator refers to facts about bombings and civilian deaths in Syria and expresses disbelief; is faintly sarcastic about the ‘lack of sufficient information’ that the nominee speaks about and pushes hard. The nominee reiterates that he does not have sufficient information. (Watched: Rubio and some other senators; some commentaries on CNN, MSNBC; BBC World; read: nothing.) The long-standing tradition: the Senate hearings are reasonable and honest; tough questions that bypass party lines are raised; the commission must be satisfied before the nomination is put to vote; worrisome candidates face grilling. Further: the nominee outlines the policies of the administration, acts as a responsible public figure during the hearings and both are judged in terms of their effects on the US national interests. What does the principle of charity advocate in this case? Let us begin with the assumption that Putin personally identified the targets and ordered the bombings in Syria. Let us also assume that he identified civilian targets knowingly. Assume further too that the evidence for both these assumptions is overwhelming. Questions are these: are they evidences to establish that Putin committed war crimes? What are the consequences of such a stance? Was the nominee right in saying that he did not have sufficient information to make that judgement?\nOne route: Rubio asked honest questions because he is genuinely worried about Putin and Russia. (Some snide comments about Rubio’s ‘true’ motivations by some commentators will be neglected here.) He acted in a non-partisan fashion because, as a Republican, he grilled a Republican nominee. The nominee ducked a simple question and evaded giving a straight answer to an issue that preoccupies the American people. Rubio behaved responsibly but the nominee dissimulated by refusing to accept the overwhelming evidence that Putin has committed war crimes and by pleading the lack of ‘sufficient information’.\nSecond route: if bombing civilian targets is enough to convict one of committing war crimes, what does one say about the US presidential decision to drop nuclear bombs on Hiroshima and Nagaskai? Both were civilian targets. How should we treat carpet and napalm bombings in the Vietnam war? If we make the same assumptions about the US presidents that we have made about Putin’s role in the Russian bombings in Syria, is not every single US president involved in a war abroad a war criminal by definition? Saying ‘Yes’ to Rubio’s questions would necessarily entail convicting not just all the US presidents involved in wars but also the heads of States of all nations (involved in war) of committing war crimes. A pacifist might believe this to be true, but doing so utterly trivialises the notion of war crime. In each of these cases, including the nuclear bombing of civilians, we bring in multiple arguments (military, ethical, pragmatic, social, economic, etc.) to say that killing civilians alone is not sufficient to equate it with war crimes. Consider this simple fact: six to eight months of Russian involvement in Syria has increased the probability of reducing the horrendous suffering of the Syrian people. More than 5 years of war fought by the US and her allies did not accomplish even this much. An analogous consideration is used while discussing Hiroshima and Nagasaki. All the necessary arguments and considerations required to judge are unavailable to us at this moment. In this sense, the nominee is right in saying that there is insufficient information to accuse the head of the Russian State of committing war crimes. As a probable secretary of state, he cannot go around simply transforming his moral outrage and anger (however justified they might be) into the foreign policy of his country. It is highly irresponsible to suggest that all the US presidents involved in wars are war criminals and it damages the US tremendously to accuse many more foreign heads of state of committing war crimes. It is, after all, the established practice is that a presumptive nominee for the function of the secretary of state does not damage the US. And there is no evidence of any kind to suggest that he was ducking the question, evading the issue or dissimulating. He was honest and behaved as it befits a future secretary of state.\nAgain, the principle of charity recommends both routes, while shutting out neutrality.\nMany, many more such examples could be taken up but it would be better to end with an example of a different type. There were civic disturbances on the inauguration day which was followed by a march of millions in Washington, hundreds of thousands in NY and many thousands elsewhere. CNN gave much coverage to these events, especially the march, and many others broadcasted these happenings. Of course, there were learned pundits and political experts talking about the significance of these events, not to mention the media anchors themselves. One route: there is no need to summarize the arguments (as they were continuously interspersed with comments about the inauguration numbers) except to note that it is a long-standing practice to express dissent in a democracy and that most found that the participants were justifiably expressing their problems with the election results. It also indexed the unpopularity of Trump. The broadcasted speeches (‘I am a woman and an immigrant’ lady who was apparently expressing the fear of many people in the US came on the screen repeatedly on multiple channels) were mostly appreciative of this event (even if worried about the divided America). The press and the political experts were entirely in tune with the responsible media, which informs the citizenry of important and unimportant events, that though anguishing (‘the polarisation in society’), the event itself was legitimate and laudable.\nThe other route: America, rightly or wrongly, has a great impact on many nations and people regarding democracy. This event, especially the way it was covered and commented upon, provided legitimacy and justifications to this way of expressing ‘dissent’ about democratic election results. Out of nowhere, the legitimacy of the electoral college as an institution is questioned by the mere number of ‘popular votes’. A popularity poll (even if it is expressed in terms of votes) can trump the legitimacy of the constitution in the sense that one is ‘justified’ in questioning the priority of the constitution over a popularity poll. The march was portrayed as a laudable expression of democratic freedom, even when such expressions challenge (and thus undermine) the very constitution that guarantees and safeguards such freedoms. In that case, what would be the problem if the citizens take to guns to challenge an election result they do not like? The march, the media and the pundits glorify an event that potentially undermines democracy because it is directed against someone who was not as ‘popular’ as another candidate but, nonetheless, won the election legitimately. It undermines an important democratic institution, namely the presidential office. Legitimacy is not any more an issue of Law and the constitution but an index of the changing preferences of a fickle public. By undermining the long-standing practice of the legitimacy of the rule of law and because of the strong evidence that America has a serious effect on the world, one should question not just the ‘responsibility’ of the event itself but also the justification and the legitimacy that the ‘intellectuals’ provided. Thus, the argument provided by the event and its justifiers comes down to this: the Europeans (and the world) should abolish democracy because it brought Hitler to power. (There is no assumption here that Trump is a fascist or is a Hitler. Such facile characterisations are poisonous, debilitating and highly irresponsible.)\nThe principle of charity condones both routes. Which should be taken?\nPernicious scientific rubbish (‘there are no alternative facts’, ‘there are only facts and falsehood’ etc.) are presented with an air of authority and covered with the mantle of truth that are accorded not even to God’s Word or Christ. Anything that even remotely ‘smells’ of Trump is anathema. Is there any wonder that Trump says that the media consists of the ‘most dishonest people in the world’? The same principle of charity must nod approvingly at the answers here as well.\nThe principle of charity is about ‘charity’ in the first place. It is given to those who are in need of it and to those who are needy. Who is not needy in this world? As the Bible says, and the philosophers endlessly repeat, the human being is a needy creature, which means that all human beings are always needy at all times. This means that the principle of charity is accessible to all people, in all circumstances and at all times. Normally, one supports one’s own favourite charity and one gives charity to those goals or people that one chooses. One cannot ask further justificatory questions about the choice of either the goal or the recipient of charity. Therefore, the principle of charity must be capable of supporting all claims and, in the hands of people, support their chosen claims without discrimination. To help the needy is an obligation that the Biblical God places on humanity. Thus, one responds to those needs that one’s preferences and choices dictate. This is ‘charity’. This label makes one feel good and noble because one has fulfilled God’s commandment. Hence also the ‘nobility’ of the ‘principle of charity’ that thinkers in the West so proudly propagate. If, in the process of fulfilling the needy, one forgets those who are deserving, surely, it is not a problem. If fulfilling some needs damages the deserving indirectly or obliquely, why, it is but a collateral damage; after all, unintended consequences are inevitable when it comes to human actions.\nIn other words, as I begin to realize now, the principle of charity is not only toothless but it is also pernicious and poisonous. That is perhaps one of the reasons why Indian culture knows of no ‘charity’ of any kind; it knows of ‘Daanam’, which is given only to the deserving. Bhiksha is not a daana but a one-time gift given to those in difficulties.\nThere is more that requires saying in this context but there are other times and places to do that. The post is already too long. A great deal of thought is required to realize how deeply Christian all of us have become. Perhaps, there is still some hope left for the heathen ‘souls’.\n","tags":[],"title":"Principle of Charity and Normativity","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/principle-of-charity-and-normativity/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","basics","History","knowledge","translation","bullshit","erudition","truth"],"content":"Why understanding bullshit is important? Three reasons: (a) there is a very frequent use of the word ‘bullshit’ (mostly in my posts); (b) bullshit has been tied directly to truth in the literature on the subject, (c) far more important is the fact that it is much more connected to knowledge than has so far been acknowledged. In this post, the focus is on the third reason.\nI\nFirst, an ‘autobiographical’ point: I was charmed by how Akeel Bilgrami spoke about ‘bullshit’, when we met each other for the first time. Akeel also said that we call this ‘bakwas’ in Hindi. This resulted in revisiting Harry Frankfurt’s article on the issue; it further led to reading the late G.A. Cohen’s contribution on the topic and going through most of the literature on the subject. (Some interesting stuff on the theme is collected in an edited volume on the subject that was published a few years ago.) Since then, some on and off thinking on the subject has been going on, some of whose results you shall notice in this post.\nSecond, a line or two about ‘bullshit’. Frankfurt ties it to truth: the bullshitter, unlike the liar, does not value truth. The honest person does; the liar too because he values it enough not to speak truth. The bullshitter, by contrast, is indifferent to truth. G.A. Cohen modified the thought further. As an ex-Marxist, his reference point was the Althusserian Marxism of the early 70’s. (Louis Althusser was a French Marxist and his formulations were influential for some time; some of his thoughts live on in various forms to this day, outside Marxist thought.) What is interesting about Cohen is his attempt to tie, more implicitly than explicitly, bullshit to knowledge.\nThird, some thoughts about the relationship between bullshit, truth and knowledge. Let us assume that there are different types of bullshit. (May be the difference is one of dimensions; perhaps, there are different kinds of bullshit. These are not issues for now.) Is it possible to identify one of the most malicious and dangerous types of bullshit? Yes. It is this type that my posts identify and react to.\nFrankfurt suggests that the bullshitter does not value truth. In some senses, he is right. However, the questions are these: what is this ‘truth’ that the bullshitter is unconcerned about? Why should ‘truth’ concern us at all? Clearly, here, the issue is what ‘truth’ is or, at least, what that word means. There is some clarity on these questions today. Alfred Tarski, a Polish logician, was the first to work out a clear explication of one of the notions of truth that we use very often. Called the ‘semantic’ or ‘Aristotelean’ conception of truth, it captures the idea that sentences that describe what is the case (and, where applicable, what is not the case) are sentences that we call ‘true’. This conception of ‘truth’ (as we know, this is but one of the conceptions of truth we have, something which Tarski also explicitly acknowledged), thus, makes ‘truth’ into a property of sentences. Even though there have been great developments in logic during the last 70 years and many, many discussions and disagreements about how ‘truth’ should be understood or explicated, the basic consensus is this: whatever else ‘truth’ is, it is indubitable that it is connected to linguistic utterances (whether such utterances are only sentences or they also include propositions expressed by sentences). To keep it very simple: truth is a linguistic property or is a predicate applicable to languages. With this idea even vaguely in place, we can say this much accurately: a Frankfurtian bullshitter is not concerned about speaking (or writing) true sentences. The truth-teller obviously is; the liar is concerned enough not to speak (or write) true sentences. The bullshitter does not care about truth or is not concerned to write or speak true sentences. Of course, the question is, ‘why’? Frankfurt seeks answers in the following concern of the individual: ‘to shape the beliefs and attitudes of his listeners in a certain way’. But this answer is exactly the malicious and dangerous kind of bullshit that he himself is against.\nObviously, ‘shaping beliefs and attitudes of listeners’ is not a problem. If it is, education, growth and transmission of knowledge are not possible. That would deny, in one sense, the only goal of culture, civilization and education. Thus, the burden falls on the phrase: ‘in a certain way’. Which is that way? The Frankfurtian answer will have to go something like this: that way expresses an unconcern about speaking (or writing) true sentences. (To use a slogan, original to Feyearbend, but in its invariable but well-known deformation: ‘anything goes’.) What is wrong with this ‘way’? Keeping only the Franfurtian formulation in mind, consider situations of the following kind: (a) one speaks helpful and comforting words to a person in distress without being concerned about speaking true (or false) sentences; (b) a medical nurse speaks kind words in the children’s cancer ward to the child and/or to its parents without being concerned at all about speaking true or false sentences; (c) a person speaks sentences to a torturer that postpone torture without any regard to their truth or falsity; etc. You could multiply many such situations indefinitely, but the point is this: they are Frankfurtian bullshitters, yes, but what is wrong with it? Do not take the easily available ‘moral route’ to answer this question; before escaping there, consider two other kinds of situations. Imagine academic courses (leading to a degree at a university) in, say, sociology, anthropology or architecture. Let us say these deal with local societies, local cultures and city planning respectively. Let us also assume that this is a major course syllabus and that it counts for half the entire course. The course syllabus and the examination consists only of this: the telephone directory (of the city, of the region, of the nation). Each entry in that book is true; it is about people in the region; it contains true sentences about names, addresses and numbers. The teacher, who teaches you, is the opposite of the Frankfurtian bullshitter: he insists that you learn to speak only true sentences. Would you or would you not say that this is ‘bullshit’? Both the teacher and the university, you would say, are ‘bullshitters’. Expand this example further, modified in appropriate ways, to all the domains you can think of. The second kind of example. Romila Thapar, a JNU historian, is well-known to most of you. A few years ago, in an article in the EPW (The Economic and Political Weekly), she wrote the following: “Historians of the 19th century may have been searching for “the truth” about the past, but we no longer do so.”\nVery well. Since the article was written to exhibit my total lack of knowledge of history of any kind, but is done so with laudable decency because I was nowhere referred to, let me ask: If historians of today no longer search for ‘the truth’ about the past, what exactly do they search for, when they study history? ‘The Falsehood’ about the past? In that case, all modern historiography lies. Not of any kind, obviously, No, it tells only ‘the’ falsehood. If that is the case, why criticize the BJP historians for ‘lying’ about history? Surely, it cannot be because the BJP historians tell ‘small’ lies, whereas ‘scientific’ historiography, if it is to be worth the title of ‘science’, should seek and write only ‘the’ falsehood about the past. Because she speaks of ‘knowledge’ and not of ‘science’, one has to say: modern historians have ‘the’ knowledge that ‘knowledge’ about the past can only be ‘the Falsehood’. Therefore, ‘the falsehood’ should be sold as ‘knowledge’ and that is what historians do. Etc. Such consequences must be implied because she discourses further in the subsequent sentence about inaccessibility: “We cannot arrive at the ultimate truth of what is not fully accessible to us.” What exactly does ‘ultimate’ truth, or the ‘pen-ultimate’ truth, or the ‘nth member’ of truth mean? What does ‘full accessibility’ of anything in the world mean or even suggest? Do we have ‘full accessibility’ to a single sentence we compose, or to the Euclidian definition of a ‘circle’ or to that single line in a programing code that we write? Do we have ‘full access’ to that small quantity of oxygen that we inhale in a single breath or to that sip of water that we drink from a glass? How would we recognize ‘full’ access, if and when we get it? If we cannot, what does it mean to speak of ‘full access’, when we do not have a clue what that word could possibly mean? May be, the past is not ‘fully accessible’ to us because that word, ‘full accessibility’, is nonsensical. Etc. (Her incoherent babbling is literally mind-numbing). This is unalloyed bullshit, one would say. Perhaps, that is why she is so well-known and so greatly respected by academic historians: bullshitters, obviously, do immensely respect fellow bullshitters.\nThe previous point that brings bullshit in connection with knowledge suggests why ‘truth’ is an important ‘value’ in our case. In a cryptic, if in a rather familiar form: because knowledge is true, truth is valued. The ‘value’ of truth, here, is a derivative. Knowledge is ‘valued’ and because knowledge is truth, the latter is also ‘valued’. It is this connection that allows us to resonate with the quest for ‘knowledge’ or, often used as its synonym, ‘for truth’. This quest resonates deeply in both India and the West. We believe that when one seeks knowledge, one seeks truth. Or that if one seeks truth, one has to know. Ignorance never finds truth, but knowledge is always true. These common-sense formulations, which are very deeply alive in cultures, bind truth and knowledge together in a very tight way. The thought is millennia old: today we can be more subtle, more sophisticated in its formulation than when it is unreflectively spoken. However, the task at hand is not that. What happens when this idea of ‘knowledge’ gets trivialized? In the West, both Truth and Knowledge were primarily seen in terms of God: He was Knowledge and He was The Truth. Without going into how or why it happened, we need to notice where we are today. In the West, knowledge is ‘justified true belief’ (in its Anglo-Saxon formulation that the famous Gettier’s Paradox undercut). That is, knowledge is about belief (generally, about the world). In simpler terms: knowledge is a set of sentences. That set of sentences could be called a ‘theory’, or a ‘hypothesis’; it could be seen as an object of ‘belief’ or it could express ‘meaning’; or whatever else that sentences are supposed to do. Historically, this move occurs first. That is, knowledge was first identified with sentences. Which ‘property’ makes sentences into knowledge? ‘Truth’, of course. As a result, knowledge begins to conceptually disappear, while remaining as a word-in-use (yet, it retains its intuitive connotations). Thus, truth of sentences acquire priority and ‘knowledge’ begins to become a derivative of the truth-property of sentences. Because not every sentence is knowledge and only true sentences could claim that status, and also because ‘knowledge’ cannot so easily disappear through fiats of whatever kind, some kinds of sentences end up becoming the best and the most prototypical exemplars of ‘truth’ and, therefore, ‘knowledge’. These are called ‘Facts’. Facts are True and fact is Knowledge. Fact vs Fiction is the fight between Truth and Falsity and between Knowledge and Ignorance and between Science and Religion and between Science and Superstition, and so on and so forth. Tarski’s notion of truth tried to tell us what ‘truth’ in sentences mean. Our incoherent jumble of common-sense ideas about science embody this situation: ‘Science is Knowledge’ means (a) science=the truth; (b) science=facts; (c) science=theory=a set of sentences=(relative) truth=knowledge. And so on and so forth. However, despite being abolished to the periphery, knowledge continues to grow: yes, science is knowledge but it is not a set of theories; experiment is an essential component of science and thus knowledge; science can be understood without any reference to the ‘truth’ of sentences; science does not seek truth nor should its descriptions be seen as true descriptions of the world; there are no ‘facts’ to function as the furniture of the world, and so on.\nHopefully, this is sufficient to say that trivialization of knowledge involves seeing it as a set of true sentences. Then every true sentence, which is a fact by definition, becomes knowledge. A telephone directory, then, is one of the best exemplars of such ‘knowledge’. These ‘factoids’, as I call them, is modern day historiography (for example). A database (with all facts) together with the sorting criteria is the most ‘complete’ exemplification of what knowledge could possibly mean. Bullshit is this, fundamentally: trivialization of knowledge. This trivialization takes the following form: a collation of factoids connected randomly to each other is sold as knowledge today. Because it is basically the sale of a fake product, different people use different techniques to con people: one uses Foucault and Marx; the other appeals to Derrida; the third seeks game and choice theories; the fourth combines some literary theory with post-colonialism; the fifth cites Shankara and Allama; and so on and so forth. This is exactly what Frankfurt does: Trump is a bullshitter (and, of course, a liar) because he is not concerned about speaking ‘true’ sentences. How could Frankfurt and his ilk even know what Trump’s concerns are, when they do not even know why they themselves present these four words, ‘in a certain way’, (which is a ‘fact’) as knowledge? Most of us on this board have no knowledge of what science is, what knowledge is, what truth is, and so on. Many of us who hold forth on ‘science’ and ‘knowledge’ on this board have not done even a basic reading of the literature that has tried to do research on these issues. Yet, they have no problems in criticizing ‘science’, ‘knowledge’, etc. and present their writings as ‘knowledge’. Many of us have little or no understanding of ‘adhyatma’ or of Christianity; yet, some from among these, while expressing ‘deep modesty’, have no compunctions in writing ‘learned’ pieces that present rubbish (that are not even factoids) as knowledge. This is bullshit, as I use the word. It trivializes both knowledge and truth. It parasites upon the desire (present in everyone on this board) to acquire knowledge and gifts rubbish and trash as knowledge. To such people, my most sincere request: please do not do this. You might have no idea how pernicious and poisonous this bullshit is. In that case, please trust me: it tortures the living before it kills them.\nHowever, this does not mean that you cannot write till ‘you know’. If you seek knowledge, you have to ask questions; you have to formulate hypotheses; you have to be wrong; you have to make mistakes, etc. It does not mean that you have to ‘read everything’ before you write: knowledge will not be yours just because you have read. (If that were to be the case, reading the Buddha or the Gita should enlighten you). However, when you say that this shows (or proves or demonstrates) that ‘theory’ alone is not knowledge (or that ‘theory’ or ‘science’ is not ‘knowledge’) and that you seek ‘non-theoretical’ knowledge, then you are bullshitting. To you, knowledge has become a mere word. In that case, do not seek it (you will also not get it) because you will not be able to recognize knowledge when you ‘find’ it.\nIn the deepest sense I know, Matthew (7:7) was right when he so beautifully said: “Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you”. The only questions you need to ask yourselves are these: ask ‘what’; seek ‘what’; knock ‘where’?\nTo us heathens, the questions suggested by the Gospel are very important. We know the answers of the Evangelists; what are our heathen answers to these profound, Christian questions? The absolute precondition even to begin finding an answer is this today: stop bullshitting.\nII. Indian \u0026lsquo;words\u0026rsquo; or Indian roots\nA comment: Unfortunately, I find the introduction of the word \u0026ldquo;bullshit\u0026rdquo; into intellectual discourse to be far more disgusting than the use of the American term \u0026ldquo;takeaway.\u0026rdquo; I cannot stop cringing. \u0026ldquo;Bakwas\u0026rdquo; would have been so much better. A golden opportunity has been squandered to elevate \u0026ldquo;bakwas\u0026rdquo; to serve a higher intellectual purpose than it normally does.\nYour comments on ‘bullshit’ and ‘bakwas’ make for a very, very interesting reading. They are far more thought-provoking than might appear at first sight. You speak of ‘disgust’, ‘cringing’ and ‘squandering a golden opportunity’. The focus is on these three.\nTo begin with a minor autobiographical point. As a South Indian, I learnt of ‘bakwas’ only through Hindi films. Consequently, its connotations are tied to their use in the situations portrayed in such films. The associations are all with speech (and derivatively with writing): nonsense, insane (related to some uses of ‘paagal’), inane, outrageous, downright wrong, deliberate lies, etc. I have no idea whether one could be a ‘bakwasi’ (?) in the sense of being a ‘bullshitter’. However, I learnt the use of the English word after leaving home and was taught to speak ‘convent English’ (as we called it those days) by those educated in such schools. In this sense, the word became a part of speaking ‘sophisticated English’, a desirable version of the ‘Kannada-English’ that I knew before living in the Bangalore cantonment that was far, far removed from the Brahmin Basavanagudi area. Thus, intuitively, ‘bullshit’ connoted many more things than ‘bakwas’ did and its use was also an expression of ‘sophistication’. Until I heard Akeel relate these two words, it had never occurred to me that they could be translations. Visually, the sentence ‘bakwas mat karo’ or ‘ye to bakwas hai’ generated an imagery of people ‘barking’ (‘bogalu’, as we call it in Kannada). Akeel’s reference to Frankfurt and the later reading that accompanied it added intellectual depth because it became obvious that the English word (a) had a clear technical meaning; (b) picked out a social and cultural phenomenon of great importance; (c) indicated that there was something pernicious and insidious about that phenomenon; (d) identified something that one should ‘fight’ against. The Hindi word lacked this depth and specificity. Today, as I use the word, more is added. One of that ‘more’, which I will soon talk about, identifies much more precisely the ‘disgust’ that you talk about. Consider the following thought, which might help you put your sense of disgust into productive use. The excrement of the bull is not only natural but it is also an indication of the health of the animal. It is an essential and vital part of living. As a natural fertiliser, it is also productive if used on earth. However, when it is brought into an arena where it should not be present, it becomes ‘filth’. Then, it generates disgust. The question now is this: which is that arena in our case? You identify it as the realm of intellectual discourse. Very well. Why should the use of this word generate disgust, when used in intellectual discourse? One route is to assume as true that the disgust is generated by the word itself (in some fashion or another). That is, the use of the word in a specific kind of situation generates the feeling of disgust. When pressed, there are not many options open to explicate this sense further: one can only appeal to some idea of appropriateness.\nLet us try out this possible scenario (something that a philosophy professor at EFLU, Hyderabad, in response to my repeated use of the word ‘bullshit’ in my talk, enacted in an international conference there in 2015). Disgusted or enraged or both by the use of this word, he wanted to know the reasons for its use in the conference. He compared it to how some or another artist (or writer) used the word ‘fuck’ in public talks about art. That person, apparently, explained its use in terms of some kind of ‘resistance’ (against ‘establishment’ or ‘elitism’ or something like that). My recollection of this event is not accurate, but it was clear that he felt that what I did was somehow ‘inappropriate’ and simply ‘not on’. The only way I could understand our further ‘discussion’ on the topic is this: this man felt that I was violating intellectual decorum (of sorts) by bringing ‘slang’ into academic discourse. Expressions of ‘vulgarity’ (in the presence of ‘genteel folks’) could be ‘defensible’, if seen as an expression of resistance by the ‘democratic masses’ against the ‘elites’. (Hence his reference to why the word ‘fuck’ was used.) Otherwise, it is not. Elements in this situation: this man is ‘civilized’ and ‘cultivated’ (belongs to the ‘genteel folk’ or the ‘nobility’, perhaps); this state involves using ‘respectable’ phrases; ‘slang’ is how ‘the vulgar’ speak; their speech (and their choice of words) express their lowly status (either ‘ignorance’ or ‘lack of cultivation’ or both); belonging to the ‘nobility’ includes ‘delicately shuddering’ at such expressions of ‘vulgarity’: Additionally, this man belongs to that very small group of ‘exceptional’ people: the ‘enlightened’ nobility that ‘understands’ (and even ‘sympathizes’) with the ‘justified resistance’ of the ‘masses’ (read: ‘the commoner’) against the ‘pompous elite’. Whew!\nIf you do not want to tread this route, re-examine the assumption we began with, namely, the use of the word in intellectual discourse is generating disgust. Consider, instead, the following: in Indian traditions, knowledge is ‘pavitra’ (let us use ‘sacred’ and associated words as English equivalents, for the time being). It is sacrilegious to bring the profane into this domain. This domain of knowledge (gyaana, vidya, or whatever) is the abode of Saraswathi. When what does not belong to this domain enters it, the ‘paavitrya’ of the domain is damaged. The entrant becomes the ‘a-pavitra’ in that domain and pollutes it. How can anything enter a domain, unless it is a member of that domain? It cannot. If anything enters a set, group or a domain, it becomes a member of that domain. It becomes a member because it has properties that qualifies it to become one. Now, consider the possibility of ‘fake’ memberships. Things not belonging to a domain become members of that domain because the property they ‘show’ to become members of that domain are not genuine but fake. Because we are not talking about someone ‘wrongly’ or ‘mistakenly’ construing an item as a member of a set but about ‘fakes’, we are talking about dissimulation, cheating, forgery, deceit and such like. The item in discussion, in and of itself, is not a ‘fake’; as an item, it is also a member of some domain or another. However, in this particular domain, it is a fake member.\n‘Facts’, ‘true sentences’ and such like are genuine and authentic members of multiple domains. However, what if these are fake-members in the domain of knowledge? (We have any number of reasons to believe in this possibility and very few to doubt it.) When such fake members are deliberately introduced as members of the domain of knowledge, is there not deceit at work here? When intellectuals do this, are they not dissimulating? What kind of a phenomenon is it, when something that is not and cannot be knowledge is presented and sold as knowledge?\nThe ‘Paavitrya’ of Knowledge is deliberately damaged. Saraswathi is knowingly, violently and forcibly raped. What else can you feel except disgust and rage at the ‘filth’ that does this?\nThe disgust that you feel can be put into productive use, if you are able to see that what you feel might have deeper roots in the Indian attitudes towards Gyaana than it has in some idea of intellectual decorum. You can choose either the way of this EFLU professor or choose to retain the disgust but give it a proper focus. In some senses, I am very glad that the word ‘bullshit’ generates disgust and makes you cringe. Please retain both. The situation justifies both. Hence also my rage and pain.\nThus, the question we began with, namely, ‘why should the use of this word generate disgust, when used in intellectual discourse?’ gets answered. Intellectual discourse produces (and should produce) knowledge. When that is prevented and the ‘fake’ takes its place, disgust is inevitable. ‘Filth’ in intellectual discourse violates the purity of the domain. Hence the disgust.\n‘Bakwas’, as I understand the word, cannot generate any of these feelings. Irritation, mild anger, frustration, etc. are hardly the right feelings to have towards the situation talked about. The bullshitters are rapists; bullshit is rape that violates the sacredness of the knowledge domain. In the same way rape can never be unintended, neither can bullshit be. ‘Bakwas bolna’ is often innocent, harmless, wrong and is a result of ignorance. The harmful effects of Bakwas, often, have little to do with the nature of ‘bakwas’ but more with the person and his goals. Therefore, I cannot believe that a golden opportunity has been squandered by not using ‘bakwas’ as an alternative to ‘bullshit’. In a peculiar sense of the word, you can choose two ways of being ‘an Indian’. One way, useful at times, is to seek ‘Indian’ words for English ones and thus ‘upgrade’ their status. In so doing, one might or might not elevate ‘Indianness’. The second way, also useful at times, is to interrogate one’s responses and try to seek their Indian roots. This would help one understand that such feelings are reasonable too: not because some western decorum and ‘manners’ has been learnt well but because they have very good foundations and are very deeply grounded in nourishing and life sustaining mother’s milk and in grandmother’s kind and loving admonishments.\nIII. How to stop bullshitting?\nA comment: How one can refrain from bullshitting when one is living in an environment that generates either that or trivia. Indeed, I have no clear idea of the social and cultural life in America. My impressions are limited to seeing its effects on some types of intellectuals living there, the language of those enamored (directly or indirectly) by the US and its impact on some parts of the world, including Europe. These make it impossible to respond to you in any adequate fashion. Therefore, only a general and abstract heuristic that one could try to use anywhere can be offered. Here it is: when something in the world strikes you or draws your attention (whether that something is about yourself or about other human beings or whatever), try to describe and think about it in a way that can be improved upon either by you or by others. When those are your impressions, feelings, thoughts, opinions, etc., try not to use these words as ‘hedges’. (They function as hedges when (implicitly) they justify your ‘human right’ to say or write such things: it is ‘my experience’; this is ‘how I feel’; in ‘my humble opinion’; etc. signal that you are probably hedging.) Unless impossible, build ‘improvability’ into whatever you say or write. (When discussions of your formulations lead to better ones, either in the sense of helping build alternatives or in the sense of suggesting modifications, there is ‘improvability’.) When the only way to do that it is by showing inconsistencies or falsities, know too that what you have said could not have been any kind of explanation or any kind of knowledge. If, instead, the discussion helps generate an alternative, you can be sure that you are not bullshitting. This a rule of thumb and not a mechanical or infallible rule of any kind. Like all heuristics of this kind, it works only at certain times and in certain circumstances. In one sense, you can put it in this simple way: think before you write or speak. Do not seek anything other than understanding, when you write or speak. Try not to show your ‘learning’, your ‘intelligence’, your ‘originality’ or your ‘knowledge’ etc. in what you write or speak. When you speak or write only because you seek (and want) to know, the probability that you could be bullshitting is very low.\nComments Arun — 2017-09-20 20:23:00\nImagine I go to Ikea and buy some furniture that needs assembly; and when I open the box at home, I find that the assembly instructions and diagrams have been produced by a bullshitter.\nNow imagine, in the realm of politics which attracts bullshitters like bullshit attracts flies, say, the activities of my town council, and they are trying to come to some decision, say, whether to spray a certain insecticide in the town to curb mosquitos carrying the West Nile virus. We all have to consider the possible cost - the side effects of the insecticide in wiping out beneficial insects, for instance; versus the benefit; how lasting are the benefits? How soon will mosquitos return from the neighboring towns, or does there need to be a coordinated program? and so on. Imagine now we have only bullshit. How can we come to a wise decision?\nWhether knowledge and truth are only dimly reflected in true sentences, or whether true sentences are our only approach to knowledge is a bit irrelevant in this situation. If there is pure bullshit, the town council and town can\u0026rsquo;t operate properly.\nNormally, there would be some bullshit in the situation described above, but it is possible for people to sift through it and discard the bullshit.\nWhat happens when bullshit and the habit of it have risen to such a level that people, on the whole, can no longer discern bullshit from non-bullshit? When the more thoughtful and knowledgeable who can shovel aside mounds of bullshit are no longer trusted or even given a hearing, because the bullshitters have bullshit that trust out of the people? What happens to such a society?\nI think that is what we\u0026rsquo;re witnessing in the US of A. It didn\u0026rsquo;t start with Trump, it culminates with him. Years of talk radio, Murdoch media and such have overwhelmed the country with bullshit so that people don\u0026rsquo;t know between bullshit and not any more.\n","tags":["Romila Thapar"],"title":"Bullshit: True Sentences and Trivialization of Knowledge","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/bullshit-true-sentences-and-knowledge-balagangadhara/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","Christianity","Indian traditions","proselytization","tolerance","vibrancy"],"content":" Actually, there are two questions that need to be distinguished from each other.

Here, one is trying to characterize what it means to mute the \u0026lsquo;Eastern\u0026rsquo; Christianity in some recognizable way.\nWith respect to the previous question, we can make some headway if we can characterize the Indian culture and develop some hypotheses about how and in what form this culture exerted its influence on the \u0026lsquo;Eastern\u0026rsquo; Christianity. This is where we are now: trying to see whether it is possible at all to develop such a hypothesis. Consequently, the historical questions that you want to raise cannot even be formulated at this stage of research. And that for this simple reason: we would not how to go about evaluating any evidence that we may collect, or even what would count as evidence at this stage in the discussion. Would the number of the converted be the evidence, or the writings of the Patriarchs, or the number of social events that they organise, or \u0026hellip;?\nIn other words, we really need to go some way in the development of our ideas before we put them to the kind of rigorous tests they must undergo, if they have to acquire credibility. I guess I am advocating some kind of patience, while fully resonating with your demands.\n","tags":[],"title":"Proselytizing drive of the Eastern Christianity in India","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/proselytizing-drive-of-the-eastern-christianity-in-india/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","psychology"],"content":"To begin with, it is a matter of scholarly consensus among Classicists and philosophers that the concept of \u0026ldquo;Will\u0026rdquo; was absent from Greek thought and that St. Augustine was the first to develop it.

(Let us further assume that their reasoning or their strategy was something analogous to your impressions: their intention was to induce a sense of urgency and guilt.) Our problem is not to explain their possible motives but to explain the success of these strategies. Our questions are: why do all the Semitic religions (this reference to the Semitic religions is meant only keep the discussion simple) follow these strategies? Why are these strategies successful? (You can also go further and raise questions about their relative lack of success today in the western world, but we will ignore all such complications.) In the process of answering these questions, you will inevitably be forced to appeal to the nature of human psychology. This appeal will, in its turn, make assumptions about human psychology: such is human psychology that these strategies are successful. If this assumption is made, you face a very serious problem with the fact that these strategies do not seem to work with a lot of human beings (atheists, heathens \u0026hellip;). In other words, you cannot explain the success of this strategy by appealing to human psychology. If you were to restrict it to the psychology of the believers alone, you will end up providing a circular explanation: such is the psychology of the believers that they are susceptible to this strategy. (Instead, you might as well say that the strategy works with somepeople because it works with some people.) Suppose you take the following route: religion \u0026lsquo;works\u0026rsquo; only for those people who have a specific kind of psychology, you face the almost impossible task of providing some kind of empirical data across cultures and time. Further, you will also have to explain why people who were (and are) prone to guilt cease being believers. As though this is not enough, you will also have to explain why only some guilt-prone individuals become believers and some others do not. In short, this is an almost impossible exercise given our state of knowledge today. As though these problems are not enough, any psychological assumption will have to answer two other important questions. 4.1. One is the presence of a manifest denial of these psychological assumptions in the theologies of these religions. Worship expresses your love for God. Even if the Apostles (or whoever else) was a scoundrel (and the greatest genius that mankind has ever known) who used this claim as a palliative, why do people continue to accept and believe in it? Again, you will be forced to invent another psychological explanation: the believers are mentally deficient (in some appropriate sense of the term), whereas non-believers are intelligent enough to see through the strategies. Needless to say, this is simply an ad hoc explanation without any kind of warrant or plausibility. 4.2. The second question is about the fact that the believers genuinely love their God. One will have to deny this. One has to insist that the believers mistakenly identify their feelings of guilt with love. Needless to say, the explanatory task here is of mind-boggling complexity. There is a different kind of problem concealed in your difficulty, as soon as we realise that we need to explain the success of the strategies (to induce urgency and guilt). The intention of the apostles is not sufficient to guarantee its success: something called \u0026rsquo;the world\u0026rsquo; intervenes in between. It is not sufficient that I intend doing something to reach some goal in the world. I need to take the nature of the world into account as well, if I have to succeed. In short, the worry you express is a still-born child, if the goal is to understand what religion is. Worship and eschatology (for instance) are not necessary properties of an EI account. They are contingent, i.e. given assumptions about our make-up, our capacities, and so on, we need to explain why all religions have such properties. In short, what I suggest is that, if we assume the existence of religion among human beings, all empirical religions will exhibit these properties. That is to say, if we come across a religion in some part of the earth that does not speak of worshipping God, does not have an eschatology, then my hypothesis is false. One final point. I am not saying that everything that happened in history is necessary. What I do say is that given the structure of religion, some kinds of events had to happen. All religions are compelled to speak of worship, eschatology and so on.

For instance, here is what you write: \u0026ldquo;it is less interesting whether that statement is factually and objectively true, but what results and effects that particular description of the world has on our actions.\u0026rdquo; Let me identify the inconsistency first and indicate just one other problem.\nYou speak of \u0026ldquo;a particular description of the world\u0026rdquo;. If it is a description, then the predicates \u0026rsquo;true\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;false\u0026rsquo; are the only ones we can use to judge it: some statement purports to be a description of the world, and we can judge whether it fulfills that goal or not.

In fact, as I have just noted above, that is the only reason that is rationally defensible. Otherwise, one could just as well suggest that one chooses the fascist theory, even though it is known to be a false description of the world, because of its \u0026lsquo;uses\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;results and effects\u0026rsquo; both of which are salutary to the one who chooses it.\n","tags":[],"title":"Truth vs Usefulness of Theories","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/truth-vs-usefulness-of-theories/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","basics"],"content":"\u0026ldquo;Causality\u0026rdquo; is not a notion in physics but comes from philosophy.

Different peoples (distinguished from each other on the basis of ancestral traditions) could live together in a nation and a nation itself could host multiple peoples and traditions. Consequently, they did not see Christians as a people because they did not have ancestral traditions to follow. The Christians redefined what it is to be a people: they became a ‘communitas’ (a community) because of their ‘religio’. The Christians became a community because they were united “in God” and “in Christ”. They were united too in their “search for God”, which was what “conversio” (‘conversion’) meant to them. Christians were a ‘people’ now, a community that came into existence by their ‘unity in Christ’. The idea that individuals are “united” in “God and Christ” is what brings about a community and thus a people. This is a very Christian idea, which is based on the thought that individuals are united only in God. When secularized, it takes the shape of the idea that “a people” have a “common religion”. Or that every people is a people (or becomes one) because of religion.

Some also believe that all philosophy is mere ‘doxa’ but not ‘episteme’. The problem is this: what distinguishes a ‘doxastic’ sentence from an ‘epistemic’ sentence? One possibility was to say that ‘episteme’ was ‘justified true belief’ and not just a ‘mere belief’. This collapsed following the Gettier paradox which shows that this definition of ‘knowledge’ does not distinguish between mere opinion and knowledge.

If I buy a ticket and do not win, clearly my ‘hypothesis’ is ‘falsified’. Is it, therefore, scientific? Such silly hypotheses are dime a dozen. Do you think Popper was worried about this? How to falsify my hypothesis. The answer is very simple: the way scientific theories can be falsified. I spell out some consequences of my hypothesis in Chapter 11. Even though there are more, if these ‘evidences’ as I call them there are untrue, my hypothesis stands refuted in its present form. You can also test the hypothesis by refuting other sub-hypotheses that are partially derived from the main hypothesis: like, the pagan relationship between ‘religio’ and ‘traditio’ that I postulate. If you can show that many, many authors from Antiquity deny my postulation and see ‘religion’ as that which binds all people together into one single community (for instance), my sub-hypothesis is severely damaged. Falsification is about the phenomena that a theory forbids from occurring; it has nothing to do with how to protect a theory from falsification. You cannot take a single conjecture and speak about its falsification: even according to Popper, theories are the basic units of falsification and not individual conjectures.

People were enlightened (in the past) without possessing knowledge that humankind has today; one can become enlightened without being a physicist or a geneticist; one can believe in the existence of ghosts and spirits and still be enlightened… and so on. In the same way one can seek and find enlightenment while believing that human body is composed of five sheaths, one can also become enlightened by dismissing the idea of five sheaths as a false and primitive belief. There is, however, a caveat that ties knowledge to enlightenment. Perhaps, a contemporary example would help here.\nJohn Bowlby, a psychologist from yesteryears, proposed the idea that ‘attachment’ is very crucial to healthy human development. Today, apparently, this idea is becoming very popular both in developmental and child psychology and in other domains. The Indian traditions localize precisely this ‘attachment’ as one of the biggest sources of human misery and suffering. Question: which of these two claims is scientific, i.e. which of the two is knowledge? If you go with Bowlby ( or with the variations to this idea) and believe in its truth, the likelihood that you will become enlightened is very, very low. Thus, knowledge question becomes crucial here.\nEnlightenment, in this sense, is tied to knowledge and ignorance. In the simplest possible terms: absence of information about the world (defining knowledge as information about aspects of the world) is not a problem in of itself. It becomes a problem, only when it hinders knowledge. If we identify such a state of hindrance as ‘ignorance’, then ignorance prevents enlightenment, where enlightenment is identified as knowledge. The question, therefore, is: under what conditions does ignorance hinder the emergence of knowledge? It is possible to identify some very general conditions. Such conditions, quite obviously, cannot be about this or that specific hypothesis about some or another aspect of the physical world. One could imagine cases where the belief about the constitutive nature of the five elements could hinder a person from seeking or finding enlightenment; cases where it facilitates; and also cases where this belief is entirely irrelevant to the process of becoming enlightened.\nAbout the relationship between psychological traits and enlightenment. There are two different kinds of problems here. The first kind of problems has to do with the way we think and talk about human psychology today. The second kind of problems has to do with the kind of creatures we are. In one sense, you could say that both are issues concerning the relationship between knowledge and ignorance. Again, an example would facilitate.\nConsider the fact that your reference to ‘compassion’ (love and compassion are contrasted with anger and greed) suggests that compassion is a ‘good’ (or desirable or valued or however else you want to formulate it) psychological or moral or cognitive trait of a person. This is how we talk and think about human beings today. Consider this question now: what if human beings are creatures of that kind in whom compassion is a ‘bad’ trait? This question is not as crazy as it sounds: Indian traditions develop the idea that ‘compassion’ is a pathological affliction. ‘Kripa’ (or Krupa) arises from a flawed way of dealing with difficult situations, it is a pathological trait and that it has fatal psychological and cognitive consequences for the person. (‘Kripa’ is one of the core elements in ‘compassion’.) ‘Compassion’, in one way of thinking and talking, is a wonderful virtue: God is compassionate; human beings ought to be compassionate and so on. Many Indians also claim to seek ‘Guru Kripa’, ‘Daiva Kripa’, etc. and think too that ‘kripa’ is something wonderful. What if this is not the case, as Indian texts (like Gita for example) claim? What if ‘kripa’ is a debilitating psychological flaw in human beings? Which of these two conflicting and opposed beliefs is knowledge? Depending on your answer, you can tackle the issue of cultivating some or another trait in human beings.\nClaims about enlightenment are claims about the kind of creatures we are. Routes to enlightenment work on human ‘psychology’ (in the broadest possible sense of the word). If colonial consciousness prevents access to experiences, it does so by introducing multiple filters between what we ‘undergo’ in this world and how we transform these into experience. This means that the way we ask questions, think and seek answers about enlightenment is also very deeply ‘contaminated’. Because of this state of affairs, your second question, even though perfectly reasonable, genuine and understandable, is difficult to answer in a satisfactory manner. It can only be answered in a very fragmentary way today: some traits strengthen the process of enlightenment, some others are neutral and yet others hinder. This is a very, very unsatisfactory answer; but this issue can be settled definitively only by knowledge. In the same way doing science (say doing solid state physics or organic chemistry) does not give you an understanding what ‘science’ is, becoming enlightened does not mean you understand what that process or what that state is. In both cases, it is a knowledge issue. Asking questions of the right kind in a right way is crucial to generating knowledge. What Einstein says about ‘science’ might prove insightful in attempting to understand that phenomenon but it is not cognitively ‘authoritative’. The same applies to the Buddha, Nagarjuna, Shankara, Ramanuja, Vallabha, etc.\nIn short: when asking questions about enlightenment and seeking answers to them, please do not forget to think about your evaluative standards. How are you going to judge the answer? When the Buddha and Bowlby put across opposing claims, what are you going to choose, how and why? When I raised this question with a professional psychiatrist (an NRI, who is also a ‘sadhaka’ like many people I have met and heard, who also believes like many others that he accesses only a tiny fragment from that ocean of wisdom), he said that he prefers the Winnicottian formulation to Bowlby’s and that one set of claims have to do with the practice of clinical psychology and psychiatry and the other set is about the ‘spiritual’, the ‘mystical’ and the ‘adhyatmic science’. He believes that the ‘Indian wisdom traditions’ have little or nothing to with ‘science’ (and its fetishism) but with ‘the truth’ that is invisible to ‘modern science’. (Even though, in a very specific sense, he is right about a part of his statement, his reasons will only hinder his ‘sadhana’.) The routes are thus set up in the contemporary world. Choose with care.\n","tags":["Gita"],"title":"Psychological Traits and Enlightenment: Ignorance and Knowledge","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/ignorance-knowledge-psychological-traits-and-enlightenment/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","enlightenment","Indian traditions","Buddha","erudition"],"content":" Christianity (to some extent Judaism), presented an idea, unknown to the world in which it grew, namely the Pagan world of Rome. The idea was that human beings are creatures of God and that they belonged to His domain. He was the dominus or the Lord of the domain. As a result, human beings should not be arrogant, but must be humble instead. (As the ‘Book of Job’ in the Old Testament makes it clear, there is a very heavy price to be paid for arrogance.) Here, it belonged to the opposite spectrum in Ancient thought, which saw arrogance as a moral virtue and humility as a despicable vice. Protestant Christianity, especially Luther and Calvin, very forcefully propagated this idea: Man was a sinner, worse than the lowest worm, because of which God’s Grace becomes unfathomable and ungraspable.\nThis Christianity hated paganism. ‘Hinduism’, as a pagan religion, is universally hated by those who have embraced Christian thinking, even in its secular guise. That is the reason why the Protestants, and Catholics in their wake, were and are so positive about ‘Buddhism’: the Buddha became the Indian Luther who fought ‘Hinduism’. The so-called ‘thinkers’ in the US, for instance, uniformly hate ‘Hinduism’ and are sympathetic to Buddhism. (If you look at the RISA group of the AAR, you will see this hatred expressed very clearly.) Ambedkar, that insignificant man, and the Ambedkarites, who have transformed this intellectual pygmy into God, embrace this Christian hatred in its entirety. They are also the darlings of the RISA people ( I know of no exception here) in both the US and elsewhere because of this reason. I have found no other group that hates ‘Hinduism’ as much as the members of ‘Hinduism Unit’ of the AAR. I should know; I was the co-chair of this unit for 4 years. Now, I am neither a member of the AAR nor attend their silly circus, which is their annual meeting. Indians simply lick up to these AAR people and thump on tables every now and then to ‘prove’ their independence. None of them know how the US academics talk about them in their absence, nor do they realize that they are not at all taken seriously. However, these Indians know that “money does not smell”. They have, therefore, no problems with their masters as long as they are paid well and regularly.\nThis Christianity, in order partially to discredit Judaism, spoke of ‘love’ and ‘humility’ in exaggerated terms. Jesus was the embodiment of ‘love’ and Christians should embody ‘humility’. Because of the hatred and the sympathies I spoke about, this ‘property’ was attributed to the Buddha: apparently he was humble and radiated love towards all. (His notions of ‘Karuna’ and ‘Maitri’ were pressed into service here.) Of course, this praise is strictly limited to the Buddha. Vasistha, Visvamitra, Durvasa, Jamadagni, etc. have no role to play in this way of talking.\nIndians took over this entire story hook, line and sinker. ‘Vinaya’ becomes humility and every one preaches this message of universal love and maximal humility. Most Indian god-men (I reserve the use of this word to the fake guru’s in India) sell this everywhere. Understandable. They too seek fame, money and following. Some, perhaps, even seek free sex. This gets coupled to ‘political correctness’, which is destroying intellectual integrity, love and passion for truth and knowledge, intolerance towards dissimulation etc. The resulting cocktail is deadly.\nIn this forum, I was preached about ‘humility’ and how the ‘enlightened’ behave. Mr X ‘humbly’ breast-beats about his ‘roots’, the way Rajiv does breast beating as a ‘sadhaka’ of Adhytma. Obviously, they do not even know elementary things about ‘Hinduism’, including the notion that breast beating expresses your attachment to ‘the Ego’. Mr X, whose roots in Indian culture are as deep as his attachment to his ego, does not seem to realize that we know of no rishis, who were ‘humble’. Vishvamitra got offended by Indra and went into a rage and decided to build three worlds; Durvasa is known for his anger and Shapa; neither Vasistha nor Jamadagni are known for their humility. Draupadi was terrified of Durvasa and you all know how she got the ‘akshaya patra’. I suppose these people were also enlightened. In that case, why their rage or the way they humiliated their opponents, kings and ordinary men? How do we know that Buddha did not humiliate his opponents? All he has to go with is his guru and his words. That is fine with me. But, then, I need examples of such humble enlightened people from ‘Hinduism’ or ‘Buddhism’ or any other Indian traditions. I need to have many examples and they must vastly outnumber others. Only then does it become buyable. Was guru Nanak a ‘humble’ man? And Shankara, or Ramanuja or Madhva? How could Indians use this concept to describe these people, when no Indian language has a word for it?\nAnd then some people hold forth here, expressing their erudition. Sanskrit words abound, this or that post is written that tells us how some guru or another says something different or how ‘kalyana’ is a property of Brahman and about purusha and prakriti and so on. The question is: why are these things relevant? I am building a hypothesis about enlightenment and that makes use of my language from the 21st century. I am not commenting on any of these gurus. Those who have written on this made use of languages of their time. Further, even though they grappled very hard, they could not formulate certain thoughts because they did not have access to the theories and languages that I have. Furthermore, I do not claim (a silly claim, as far as I am concerned) that my hypotheses will show that everything they said is ‘true’. In the nature of things, it cannot be done scientifically. It is highly probable that I can show that many of them spoke nonsense in many of their writings. My only burden is to propose cognitive hypotheses that make their mistakes appear reasonable. For instance, I can already show that some things that some Upanishads say; some commentaries of Shankara on the Brahma Sutra; some formulations in the Brahma Sutra itself, etc. are nonsensical, to put it mildly. I can already show why they are nonsense. I have yet to figure out appropriate hypotheses required to explain them or prove them. In short: by simply pointing out what Ramanuja says or what Shankara says, as though such remarks are criticisms of my hypotheses, one is wasting my time. I am not a follower of any of these people, including the Buddha. The only thing that I can and will do is this: propose a set of coherent hypotheses that will capture their basic concerns and derive their different answers from these without ad hoc modifications. It is in the nature of things that I cannot derive all their positions. Some will escape the net. However, we do know that this is inevitable: the discussions about ‘incommensurability of theories’ have shown this over and over again. Very simply put: I am doing science and not translating or defending this or that guru from the past or the present. My relationship to Indian culture is based on four decades of intense scientific research. I am not nor have I ever been a nationalist. I love, admire and respect Indian culture because of what it has brought forth, but not because I am a ‘Hindu’.\nMy piece on enlightenment was an attempt at capturing an experience that is neither fleeting nor induced by drugs. I live that experience; not just everyday but every minute including in the dream state. I cannot get rid of the way I experience the world. I use the word ‘enlightenment’ because I know of no other word that is as close to communicating that experience to others. I do not know whether I am enlightened. Nor do I care whether other recognize me as an enlightened person. All I can say is this: like all human beings, I too seek happiness or Ananda. I have found it because I see that I am that happiness. Actually, there is nothing to search for, when you are what you search. But the strange thing is that, somehow, a fruitless search is a precondition to finding what cannot be found through such a search.\nI am reading what Indian adhyatmins have written about this entire process only because it sheds light on my experience and allows me to reflect about it and, hopefully, help me teach those whom I can teach. However, in some aspects, I know that I will go far beyond what they have written. Not because I am ‘better’ than they are but because I can access things they could not. I am born to a period which equips me differently than they. In other aspects, I sense their depth. I am not sure I can capture that depth adequately. Today, in any case, I cannot.\nTo sum up: if people want to learn, they better develop the required attitude. Without that, no learning is possible. It matters nothing to me whether or not I repeat a Shankara or a Ramanuja.\n[ *Humilitas: Lost Key to Life, Love and Leadership\u0026rsquo;*s author John Dickson talks about Christianity, humility and the Ancient world .]\n","tags":["humility"],"title":"Humility is a despicable vice","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/humility-is-a-vice/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","enlightenment","Indian traditions","sat(asat)","Buddha"],"content":"If the ‘I’ cannot be individuated or described, then there is no possible distinction between the ‘I’ and ‘the Brahman’. They are different names for ‘self-awareness’ which pick out the differential access that individuals have to ‘self-awareness’. Hence, the curious distinction that some Indian traditions make. On the one hand, the ‘I’ is alleged to be identical with the ‘Brahman’; on the other, the same traditions distinguish between ‘Atmagyaana’ and ‘Brahmagyaana’. These two ‘gyanaas’ can be two types of knowledge, if, on one reading, they are knowledge about two different objects, namely ‘atman’ and ‘Brahman’. If, however, they are identical, there could be only one knowledge. Second, even that is not possible. We can only have knowledge of something, if that something exists. If Atman or Brahman exist in this Universe, they are also subject to the processes that occur here. One such is decay and disintegration. Therefore, if we think this problem through, there is only one conclusion possible (if we assume that all Indians have not always been imbeciles): the gyaana is about the processes of accessing the real. It is not and cannot be about the real. This means that the debate within the Indian traditions is not and could not have been about the nature of ‘atman’ or ‘Brahman’. Thus, the idea that is propagated as ‘the’ truth about the alleged conflict between the dvaita and the advaita is spurious and false. There was clearly debates and conflicts. But these cannot be about the nature of the real. The same is true about the alleged conflict between ‘Buddhism’ and ‘Brahmanism’. Atman and Anatman are not conflicting doctrines about the real at all; they could not be. It is logically impossible that this was the debate between representatives of these traditions, unless we assume that Indians are congenitally incapable of thinking logically,. Those who sell this story, whether in India or abroad, the western savants and their Indian slaves, are the truly perfect imbeciles, which they actually think that Indians are. These idiots are our professors and many guru’s in India and elsewhere. Thus, we see that Ambedkar and the Ambedkarites (in India and elsewhere today) are total slaves of their western masters. To ‘convert’ from ‘Hinduism’ to ‘Buddhism’, as though they are conflicting religions, is to simply ape the western cretins who have been selling this story for nearly 200 years. Of course, the Ambedkarites do that because their fame and fortune depends on slavery. They would rather be slaves of cretins than live free as thinking human beings. The western ‘thinkers’ in the US fete them because they love the adulation and adoration they get from these Indians. And, as is the case with Pollock, they are “friends with benefits” with Indians: getting millions of dollars from idiots like Narayan Murthy and receiving national awards from the Indian government.\n","tags":[],"title":"Alleged conflict between 'Buddhism' and 'Brahmanism'","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/alleged-conflict-between-buddhism-and-brahmanism/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","normative","secularization"],"content":"First: there is nothing morally wrong in posting an opinion. My problem is that (a) it occurs within the context of generating and criticising knowledge; (b) its cognitive value is either zero or negative; (c) it is presented as though thoughtless opinions (almost all opinions are thoughtless) form a counterpoint to knowledge or are themselves candidates for knowledge (the latter are the hypotheses); (d) one acts as though the fact that opinions could have some moral value (because a human being expresses them) is sufficient to make them cognitively worthy; (e) cognitive nonsense is provided with a foundation in Christian (and Semitic) religious value (like ‘IMHO’, ‘humility’ for example), which is itself placed beyond discussion as though its importance is universally recognized; (Neither the Ancient Pagans nor the Asian traditions consider ‘humility’ a moral virtue. It is immoral to these traditions because it is seen as dissimulation and deception.); and so on. There is place on this forum for dissent, disagreement and criticism, but their foundation is not moral but cognitive. I do not tolerate opinions on this board, but I am willing to think about any hypothesis that appears reasonable. I will respond to misunderstandings, queries and criticisms. However, those who find my reactions (to their ‘humble opinions’) offensive should leave this group.\nSecond: you say that you know where this forum has ‘gone beyond’ and where it has not. You are simply shooting your mouth off and, once again, expressing an ‘opinion’. I do not, even for a second, believe this to be true. If it was, your knowledge and hypotheses (about both) should far outstrip anything anyone in this group has written. Unfortunately, the republic of letters has never heard of you or of this huge result. For instance, I would like to know what you think is the ‘limit’ of any of my hypothesis. By waving your hand vaguely in the direction of themes that I ( or anyone else in the world) have nothing to say about is not to show limits of any kind. Please realize something very important: only one thing can set the limits of knowledge. Do you know what it is? Ignorance. Because this is true, I have a request to make: please tell me how your ignorance gives you an insight into where I have gone beyond and where I have not.\nThird. Here is how you express opinions: “Theoretical framework works with well-defined words, not with vague ones that nevertheless are important.” Question: which idiot told you this? No human being who has done science or has working knowledge of philosophy would dare say this today. As an example: go read ‘The Origin of the Species’ of Darwin. Note the title of this book, note too that it talks about the origin of ‘the species’. Note further that Darwin thought that, perhaps, the species were the basic units of selection. Yet, Darwin did not define the word ‘species’ and, even today, there is an active discussion about what species are and how to define that term. Yet, this fact does not prevent you expressing your opinion with a certainty that only ignorance can provide.\n","tags":[],"title":"Is humility a virtue?","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/is-humility-a-virtue/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","basics"],"content":"You say: “As far as I know, \u0026ldquo;doxastic coherence\u0026rdquo; means consistency in beliefs and that is all that is of relevance here.” It is not. Doxastic coherence is coherence between beliefs considered as opinions; its contrast set is “epistemic coherence” i.e., coherence between beliefs as knowledge claims. Further, in some senses, while there can be no coherence if there is no (logical) consistency between sentences within a particular theory, ‘coherence’ does not mean ‘consistency of beliefs’. One could have a coherent set of beliefs even if it comprises of mutually exclusive or even (logically) inconsistent subsets of beliefs. That is because (logical) ‘consistency’ is defined within a particular meta-logic, whereas ‘coherence’ applies to discourses. They do not, therefore, mean the same. One can have a coherent discourse, where multiple logics are used in different fragments of the same discourse. While some logics could allow material implication (or some other logical connective), other logics used within the same discourse might consider material implication an invalid rule of inference. This inconsistency (one and the same rule of inference is both valid and invalid) in two different fragments of a discourse does not make the discourse incoherent.

Even more radically: the Real can never be ‘explained’, nor will there be an explanatory theory, ever (that is what is meant by ‘providing an explanation’ or speak of explaining) about the real.\nWell, if the ‘Real’ comprises of “all these doctrines” then the Real is the world of ideas as distinct from the material and the mental world. Popper believed this to be the case, and called it the ‘third world’. You are, therefore, right on the spot when you call me ignorant. Yes, indeed, I did not know that Indians were Popperians avant la letter: avant la letter, because Popper did it with a clarity and verve that Indians never attained. This is the second reason I do not want to wake up. ‘Awakening’ of the type you propagate is terribly depressing because the resultant ‘gyaanodaya’ is this: Buddha, Shankara, Ramanuja, Madva (to mention only a few names) merely “prepared” the advent of Sir Karl Popper, in exactly the same way all cultures in the world before Christ were merely ‘Praeparatione Evangelica’. I wish you, who appears to be a disciple of this new ‘praeparatione’ (the famous ‘Second Coming’?), the best of luck.\nII\n‘Green’ is instanced by a ‘green object’; ‘stripes’ are instanced in a Zebra, etc. Here, these objects possess or exemplify these properties, i.e., they can be characterized as having these properties. This statement already requires an ontological commitment to the existence of ‘properties’ independent of them being instanced. Of course, with some modifications to the formulation, one can also express a nominalistic ontological commitment. We can also go further and see ‘existence’ itself as a property that requires an instantiation. (As you know, there is no consensus about this.) In this sense, an emergent property, if it exists, should also be instantiated in an object other than itself. If this is what you are saying, the answer is evident: human beings do not ‘possess’ the property of ‘self-consciousness’, i.e. they are not instances of a property called ‘self-consciousness’. A complex system manifests an emergent property that does not exist but is real. For it to be ‘instanced’ in the world, it needs to exist, which it does not. One is not bloating one’s ontology by postulating an entity that exists with weird properties. One is explaining the existence of the ‘I-ness’ by postulating something real, namely the ‘I’. ‘I-ness’ and ‘I-hood’ exist: these are facts about human beings. This is being explained by their access to the real. Their access is a fact, but that which they access is not. Thus we need to explain how we can access what does not exist. But that depends on future research. In fact, it is no less of a mystery how we can access anything at all, even if it exists. I do not think that this is the problem of universal vs singulars. That problem plays itself out entirely in the domain of existence.\nIf enlightenment were to be evidenced by psychological and behavioural patterns, it is possible to say whether or not someone is enlightened. However, if enlightenment is to be evidenced by one’s complete access to the real, there are no facts of the matter. We know we have a partial access to the ‘I’, the real. (This is a hypothesis.) One can think of a full access as well. The ‘I-ness’ and the ‘I-hood’ are facts. Question is: what explains them? One route is to postulate the ‘causes’ in the world. The other is to postulate human access to the real. The first has brought us nowhere so far; it has increased human misery on a gigantic scale. However, if and when such an explanation comes, it would be empirically ‘testable’ (in some senses). The other explanation is not ‘empirical’ (in the sense that it is not about ‘causal’ facts), but it helps human beings find happiness. What would one like to choose? The choice has to be made on pragmatic grounds.\n","tags":[],"title":"Is Sat explainable?","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/is-real-explainable/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","basics","enlightenment","Indian traditions"],"content":"You say: \u0026ldquo;there seems to be an underlying assumption that all participants in the thread seem to be making.

I want to provide a description of the Indian traditions as attempts to help human beings find happiness on earth. (For the time being, in order to avoid fruitless controversies and to have a point of departure, I take Aristotelian Eudaimonia to be an explication of this notion of happiness.) Assumptions often do require warrant, but hypotheses do not. Because the truth of a conclusion depends on the truth of the premise (often, assumptions function as premises in an argument) provided valid rules of inferences are used, it makes sense to ask for the warrant of an assumption. Needless to say, this condition does not hold for hypotheses: you have to evaluate them entirely differently. Of course, in one sense, such a reconstruction would be the hypothesis I propose.

Because of that, a ‘faithful’ translation of Sanskrit into English is not the primary requirement; the process and the goal should determine how the words are best understood. With this in mind, some suggestions regarding the translation of the Sanskrit verses.\nIt is important to notice that the words in these verses refer to components (physical, physiological, psychological, etc.). Therefore, assume that human ‘mind’ (or human psychology) is referred to (or spoken of) in modular terms.\nमनोबुद्ध्यहंकार चित्तानि नाहं न च श्रोत्रजिह्वे न च घ्राणनेत्रे । न च व्योम भूमिर्न तेजो न वायुः चिदानन्दरूपः शिवोऽहम् शिवोऽहम् ।। manobuddhyahaṅkāra cittāni nāhaṃ**na ca śrotrajihve na ca ghrāṇanetre |na ca vyoma bhūmir na tejo na vāyuḥcidānandarūpaḥ śivo\u0026rsquo;ham śivo\u0026rsquo;ham||\nThe first line picks out four such modules. If chitta is read as ‘focus’ or ‘attention’, it is best to understand its function or role in terms of a ‘scanner’. This module or component scans what comes in from the outside as well as what occurs in the body. The scanned results are transmitted to ‘manas’. Imagine it as the module that ‘interprets’: it translates the ‘language’ of chitta into a ‘language’ that ‘buddhi’ can work with. (In very, very crude programming terms, ‘manas’ interprets inputs from chitta and outputs them in a language that ‘buddhi’ can compile. This analogy is very crude because you can also see ‘manas’ as the compiler and the ‘buddhi’ as the interpreter or even reject this functional analogy. Use it only if the analogy is required or is helpful. Do not take this as a true description of their functions or their nature.) If this crude terminology is retained, ‘Ahamkara’ identifies the ‘programmer’: he is inside the person or in the body, he is the person or the body and so on. The ‘I’ (‘aham’) is none of these modules (or components). The first line suggests that the sense of self that we have (the feeling of ‘I’), is not the sensing or experiencing of any component or object or module existing in the human mind. The verse elaborates this idea further in the next two lines: neither is it a component of the body, nor is it any of the ‘basic’ elements of the physical world. (Many cultures and people believed that earth, water, sky, fire and air were the fundamental elements that made up the world. Retain this understanding to translate ‘pancha bhuta’.) In very simple terms: the ‘I’ that we all sense or experience is not an object either in the human mind, or in the body or in the world. The subsequent verses carry these thoughts further.\nन च प्राणसंज्ञो न वै पंचवायुः, न वा सप्तधातुः न वा पञ्चकोशः । न वाक्पाणिपादौ न चोपस्थपायु, चिदानन्दरूपः शिवोऽहम् शिवोऽहम् ।। na ca prāṇasaṅjño na vai pañcavāyuḥ**na vā saptadhātur na vā pañcakośaḥ |na vākpāṇipādau na copasthapāyucidānandarūpaḥ śivo\u0026rsquo;ham śivo\u0026rsquo;ham ||\nNone of the different components of the body (the ‘animate’, different ‘gases’, different organs) is the ‘I’.\nन मे द्वेषरागौ न मे लोभमोहौ, मदो नैव मे नैव मात्सर्यभावः । न धर्मो न चार्थो न कामो न मोक्षः, चिदानन्दरूपः शिवोऽहम् शिवोऽहम् ।। na me dveşarāgau na me lobhamohau**mado naiva me naiva mātsaryabhāvaḥ |na dharmo na cārtho na kāmo na mokşaḥcidānandarūpaḥ śivo\u0026rsquo;ham śivo\u0026rsquo;ham ||\nThis ‘I’ does not have (or possess) properties (whatever their nature) like hatred, greed, etc. Nor does it have goals: ‘being ethical’, ‘being rich’, ‘satisfying desires’ or ‘to be liberated’.\nन पुण्यं न पापं न सौख्यं न दुःखं, न मन्त्रो न तीर्थो न वेदा न यज्ञ । अहं भोजनं नैव भोज्यं न भोक्ता, चिदानन्दरूपः शिवोऽहम् शिवोऽहम् ।।na puṇyaṃ na pāpaṃ na saukhyaṃ na duhkhaṃ**na mantro na tīrthaṃ na vedā na yajña |ahaṃ bhojanaṃ naiva bhojyaṃ na bhoktācidānandarūpaḥ śivo\u0026rsquo;ham śivo\u0026rsquo;ham ||\nThe ‘I’ is not something that is bound by things that circumscribe, like ethical or legal consequences or rituals etc. It is neither the subject nor the object nor the process of ‘consumption’.\nन मे मृत्युशंका न मे जातिभेदः, पिता नैव मे नैव माता न जन्मः । न बन्धुर्न मित्रं गुरूर्नैव शिष्यः, चिदानन्दरूपः शिवोऽहम् शिवोऽहम् ।। na me mṛtyuśaṅkā na me jātibhedaḥ**pitā naiva me naiva mātā na janmaḥ |na bandhur na mitraṃ gurunaiva śişyaḥcidānandarūpaḥ śivo\u0026rsquo;ham śivo\u0026rsquo;ham||\nThe ‘I’ is not bound by ‘death’ that limits all organisms, or by ‘relations’ (whether social, familial or cognitive) that chart our existence.\nअहं निर्विकल्पो निराकार रूपो, विभुत्वाच सर्वत्र सर्वेन्द्रियाणाम् । न चासङ्गतं नैव मुक्तिर्न मेयः, चिदानन्दरूपः शिवोऽहम् शिवोऽहम् ||ahaṃ nirvikalpo nirākāra rūpo**vibhutvā ca sarvatra sarvendriyāṇaṃ |na cāsaṅgataṃ naiva muktir na meyaḥcidānandarūpaḥ śivo\u0026rsquo;ham śivo\u0026rsquo;ham ||\nThe ‘I’ does not have properties which objects (events, processes) in the world have (like growth, development, transformation, etc.); it is the ‘vibhu’ everywhere and of the ‘sense organs’. (‘Vibhu’ gets translated as ‘master’, ‘controller’, ‘lord’ etc. If you keep this notion, it has to be divested of its most crucial element, namely, ‘vibhu’ as an expression of ‘power’, or as a ‘controlling force’. You need to understand the ‘controller’ here as something that does not and cannot ‘control’ anything or exercise any ‘power’ over anything, including itself.) It is neither attached nor does it require to be freed.\nThese rough translations are enough to think through the basic thought: the ‘I’ is not something with properties which we ascribe to objects (events, processes) in the world. It is not an object in the physical, physiological, psychological, social, cognitive and the ethical world we inhabit. It does not possess (or have) any property that an existing entity in the world has (or should have). Yet, we sense or experience this ‘I’ in the world. Now, questions begin to emerge: Could it be an imaginary entity? But such entities exist, even if they do so as imaginary entities. Perhaps, it is a hallucination. In that case, are all human beings hallucinating all the time? On the other hand, if we ‘sense’ or ‘experience’ this ‘I’ in the world and are not hallucinating, what is this ‘I’? If it is not any kind of an object existing in the world, what do we sense or experience? If it is not an object (event, process) in the world, how could it be ‘everywhere’? If we can only access things that are there in the world, how could we ever access or experience ‘it’, when ‘it’ does not exist? And so on. What is this ‘it’, ‘the I’? In short, who am I?\n‘Thinking through’ merely means this: take components, whatever they are, whether anger or money, fame or house, father or your kidneys and ask, is this me? Would I not be me if I lose this? Add as many new elements as you want: this Nike shoe, that IPhone 7, this beautiful number which tells you the state of your savings, that original thought which showed you, but not the others, the kind of unrecognized genius that you ‘really’ are, this liver which is scheduled for a transplantation or that tooth which got pulled recently….To each, ask the question: is this the ‘I’ that ‘I’ experience? Would I not be me if I lose this property or did not have this property or was not this? Thus, one way to avoid monotony of this thinking process is to expand the range of objects (events and processes) to include things that Shankara does not mention. The other way is to expand the thinking to include relationships that pick out the ‘I’, namely, the ‘my’, ‘mine’, etc. (My house, my fame, my wife, my dog, my car…) The third would pick out ‘properties’: of your ‘personality’ (I am a thinker, I am an introvert, I am clever or intelligent or stupid…), or of your body (I am beautiful, I am fat, I am strong…) And so on.\nIf you are able to initiate this process and sustain it over a period of time, you will reach the stage where you have to admit that the ‘I’ that you experience cannot possibly exist in the world. Because the world is everything there is, you cannot experience the ‘I’ if it is not there in the world. Though you are not hallucinating, the ‘object’ of your experience does not and cannot exist in the world. Nor can it exist ‘elsewhere’, i.e. ‘outside’ the world, because if something exists at all, it exists in the world. (After all, that is what ‘the world’ means. Even ‘non-existent’ objects, Sherlock Holmes for example, are objects that could but do not exist in our world. The ‘I’ is not like that: it cannot exist; therefore, it is not merely a non-existent object that could but does not exist.) ‘Supra-mundane’, ‘spiritual’ etc. do not and cannot pick out something (whether called ‘lokas’ or ‘worlds’) that is not in the world (Vishwa). The Vishwa, as Indians circumscribe it, is everything that was, is and shall be. Nothing exists outside ‘the world’, not even ‘shunyata’ or nothingness. If something exists or even if it could only possibly exist, it does so in the world. (Please do not forget that, unlike the Semitic religions, Indian culture knows no ‘outside’ to the world. The different ‘lokas’ that one speaks about are not worlds existing outside the Cosmos or the Universe, whether they are localizable, ‘visible’ or ‘invisible’ to human sight or whatever else. The World or Vishwa is all inclusive: it includes ‘ghosts’, ‘spirits’, ‘gods’, and such like, if these are in the world.)\nThis process works best with those who have an intellectual orientation and think that knowledge is their route to enlightenment. The end product of the knowing process, that which emerges as the fruit, is knowledge. Thus, it is neither esoteric nor exotic nor mystical. In the fullest and purest sense of the word, the fruit is knowledge: it structures what one undergoes into an experience, orients a way of being in the world and guides receptivity. Consequently, it has three distinct but connected elements: (a) hypothesis; (b) experience; and (c) state of being. (Experience and the state of being, together, test whether the hypothesis is knowledge or not.) If Sanskrit words are to be used: (a) Gyaana; (b) Anubhava; (c) Ananda. Thus, there are also strict knowledge criteria to test for enlightenment.\nOf course, you could break this process of thinking-through before it reaches completion. You could do so by choosing to come up with pseudo-talk about Sadhana and Sadhaka to ‘impress’ others and also to convince yourself that its completion requires many rebirths; or tell yourself that this is a wrong way or that it is fruitless or that it is dumb, foolish, inane, esoteric,….etc. There are indefinitely many such routes to take. If you do not follow these but do go through to the end, at that stage, and only at that stage, will the ‘who am I?’ question become your ‘own’. The last line of the Nirvana Shatkam might or might not help you during this process. However, know this: when you understand that line, you will understand the question. And you will definitely understand that line, if and when the question truly becomes your ‘own’. This is not a ‘circular reasoning; only the outer limits of the end result are indicated here.\nA final thought, expressed with very great reservations and, in a manner of speaking, against better judgement [1]: a pursuit of this process, the effort that gets put in and its result do not require a teacher, a guide, or any external help of any kind. Any human being can go through this process without external aid. When you understand the last line repeated in each of the verses, only then will you realise how it answers the question, ‘who am I?’ That stage is what we call ‘enlightenment’: ‘atmagyaana’, ‘atmaanubhava’, ‘atmasaakshaatkaara’ etc. are some of the words we use to talk in different ways about this stage. (Needless to say, this is an outline sketch of just one route to enlightenment.) Buddhists call it the state of ‘awakening’: the word identifies that state where you know that the ‘I’ cannot be an entity in the world and when further consequences of this truth to experiences in daily life are pulled out.\nBroadly speaking, two avenues open up now. To pursue either of the two, you will need help, guidance and support. The ‘guru’ (understood only as an aid, or help, or guidance) is an absolute requirement only at this stage. Generally speaking, a teacher is not a necessary requirement, even if it might be useful to have one, to become enlightened; but it becomes an absolutely vital requirement thereafter. When you get enlightened, you will also know the ‘why’.\n[1] Since the piece on enlightenment got written, a very long route has been traversed. Much is now known. The learnt admonishment that this knowledge is a ‘Rahasya’, which cannot and should not be communicated except to the deserving, very surprisingly, turns out to be absolutely true. However, the idea that knowledge contingently acquires the necessary property of being a ‘rahasya’ is, still, a disturbance.\n","tags":[],"title":"Nirvana Shatkam","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/nirvana-shatakam/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","translation","sat(asat)","real"],"content":"The problem is more complicated and the implications far more massive than either of us can even dream of. In fact, I think we are not even aware of the nature, size and the dimensions of the problem(s) today. We do not even know whether we are dealing with something called the ‘translation’ problem or whole sets of other issues and problems that also redefine what it is to ‘translate’ texts between different cultures.\nConsider the sentence: ‘Brahmano na hantavya’. I can think of more than the following defensible translations of this Sanskrit sentence into English: ‘Brahmin is not killable.’ i.e. as an entity or organism, the Brahmin is not of that kind that could be killed. (There are kinds of organisms that can be killed and those that cannot be killed and the Brahmin belongs to the latter. Clearly, the sentence is not talking about biological properties. Which precise property is being talked about then? How about this: Brahmin is one who has realized ‘Brahman’; Brahman cannot be killed; therefore Brahmin is not killable. ) ‘It is inappropriate to kill a Brahmin’. In the sense that while it might be appropriate to kill a Kshatriya, it is not the same regarding a Brahmin. ‘Brahmin does not deserve being killed’ but deserves something else. ‘Brahmin must not be killed’ in the sense one could, say, torture but not kill him. ‘Brahmin should not be killed’. An imperative mood that might express a wish, command or even an instruction. ‘One ought not to kill a Brahmin’. The ‘moral ought’. Etc. On which translation does your choice rest? Not on the grammar of the sentence (because both indicative and imperative moods are defensible translations), surely. On what else? Because we do not know which answer is the right one in this case, we can answer: ‘on the context’, ‘on your theory’, ‘on your culture’ or pretty much anything else. This is not saying much; it is like saying ‘your translation depends on everything that is relevant to the case’. Let me draw your attention to just one of the most remarkable results of these differing translations: obviously, whether the translation gives us a sentence with an ‘is’ or an ‘ought’, both are defensible! That is, both an ‘is’ and an ‘ought’ statement are ‘identical’ or are synonymous (in some or another sense of ‘synonymy’) translations of a Sanskrit sentence. The whole of moral thinking since David Hume not only insists that the ‘is’ and ‘ought’ statements are different from each other but that deriving the ‘ought’ from ‘is’ is to commit the naturalistic fallacy. This stricture (which is also a logical truth) collapses in our case. What are we to make of just this single consequence? To appreciate what is being said, consider the two following sentences: (a) People seek happiness. (b) People ought to seek happiness. (b) is not derivable from (a) without introducing a premise that contains an ‘ought’. Thus, to go from (a) to (b) we need at least one more sentence. Hence, (a) and (b) cannot ‘mean’ the same statement (irrespective what ‘meaning’ means). Yet, this truth becomes the untruth in our case. What gets effected by this result? Our theories of morality? Our theories of meaning? Our theories of language? Our theories of translation? Our theories of ontology? Our theories about human beings? Or all of them and some more?\nConsider now the following well-known shloka from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad: Asato Ma Sat Gamaya; Tamaso Ma Jyotir Gamaya; Mrityor Ma Amritam Gamaya… Here are the usual translations of this: Lead Us (me) From the Unreal (ignorance) To Real (truth); Lead Us (me) From Darkness To Light; Lead Us (me) From Death To Immortality… Let us focus only on grammar in this case and forget what ‘Sat’, ‘asat’, etc. mean. That is to say, let us discuss how to ‘translate’ the Vibhakti’s in this case. Should we translate the above as ‘From X to Y’ or ‘Through X to Y’? That is, why cannot the shloka be translated as: Lead Us Through the Unreal To Real, Lead Us Through Darkness To Light, Lead Us Through Death To Immortality…? There are two issues that we need to answer here: (a) Is the second a grammatically defensible translation (given that ‘from’ and ‘through’ are also different vibhakti’s in Sanskrit)? (b) What is involved in this translation issue? Consider the sentences of the following type: ‘I came from Delhi’; ‘The boon came from Shiva’, etc. Both can also be said to presuppose (or imply, depending upon the precise nature of the question and answer) that I came ‘through’ Delhi or that the boon came ‘through’ Shiva. Coming ‘through’ Delhi could be implied in coming ‘from’ Delhi, if the train passed ‘though’ the city of Delhi; or ‘from’ Delhi could be implied if I was coming from elsewhere other than Delhi. The same applies to the boon ‘from’ Shiva and so on. In other words, how we translate the Vibhakti’s depend upon something else other than the grammatical rules, in the sense that one could translate it either way without violating the rules of grammar. Thus, if grammar is neutral with respect to either of the two translations, why have generations of Sanskritists consistently translated the vibhkati’s only as ‘from’ and not as ‘through’? In Christian and Western thought, these terms are opposites: real vs unreal; truth vs ignorance and so on. “Even though one walks the valley of death, one does not fear death”, because the Lord is our Shepard, as the Bible puts it. God leads us away from Death towards immortality. God lead us away from Darkness into light. And so on. Is this also the case in Indian culture? Consider this: it is only through and in Samsara that we can hope to achieve ‘moksha’. If we are not in samsara, we cannot achieve moksha. Each of us, in samsara, is afflicted by avidya and only though avidya (i.e. realizing that we have agyaana is the way to realizing gyaana) can we hope to reach vidya; only through this world, which is asat, can we reach Sat. Therefore there is no break or opposition between these realms; one is needed to reach the other, i.e., only through the one can we reach the other. Therefore, ‘through’ is a better translation of the vibhkati than the ‘from’, even though our English books on Sanskrit grammar tell us the opposite, reserving them for separate vibhkati’s. Is this a question of grammar? Is this an issue about condition humaine? Is this a problem of translation? All of these and something else besides, like ontology? There is far more to be said about both than what I have. But what is said is enough to explain why I get irritated with people (like some NRI’s) who go around shouting about ‘untranslatable’ words and of ‘Indic’ concepts. They are worse than the Sanskritists in the West; these silly buggers do not even have a clue of what they are talking about, even though, in some vague sense, they are right.\n","tags":[],"title":"Translating vibhaktis","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/translating-vibhaktis/"},{"categories":["Jakob","published","reservations","dailyo"],"content":"Clearly, advocates of the caste-based reservation system are worried by the recent upheavals in Gujarat and beyond. In his \u0026ldquo;The Patidar idea of reservations\u0026rdquo; (The Hindu, September 5), Delhi University sociologist Satish Deshpande attempts to ridicule the Patidars\u0026rsquo; demand for OBC status while expressing his support for the reservation system. In this piece, I do not wish to defend or attack any particular movement, such as that of the Patidars or the Gujjars, but merely draw attention to one simple point: Deshpande attempts to defend ignorance and immorality by drawing on arguments that exhibit the same properties.\nDeshpande\u0026rsquo;s story is built around a distinction between what he calls the constitutional view and the Patidar view of reservations. The former is all about redressing caste discrimination and inequality; the latter suggests that\u0026quot;any caste can get reservation if it has the power to bend the state to its will.\u0026quot; Originally, Deshpande says, \u0026ldquo;reservation was meant to repudiate the religiously sanctioned apartheid and oppression of caste society, and to establish the community of formal equals that is a precondition of nationhood.\u0026ldquo;Let us study this claim in some detail, since it is so central to his argument.\nThe apartheid and oppression of caste society are religiously sanctioned, Deshpande claims. Indeed, this was once a common thesis of eighteenth-century missionary pamphlets and nineteenth-century Indological treatises. However, no knowledgeable Indologist or competent scholar of religion would today make the claim that caste in India is religiously sanctioned. This view has no credibility left, because scholars in both domains have shown that it reproduces a Protestant-Christian critique of \u0026ldquo;the false religion of the Hindus\u0026rdquo; in secular garb and then tries to sell this as knowledge about Indian society. But how could a present-day intellectual reproduce discredited clichés from centuries ago? The answer is obvious: only if he is ignorant of the relevant domains of study. Now, ignorance of a domain is not a problem. I also know nothing about the domains of pharmacology and physiology. Yet, if I were to prescribe medicines to patients on the basis of this ignorance, then I engage in something worse: deception. Deshpande does the same: he presents falsity as truth to defend caste-based reservations; thus, he engages in deception as a sociologist.\n\u0026ldquo;Apartheid\u0026rdquo; is a Dutch word, which entails that one sees the difference between two objects (\u0026ldquo;apart zijn\u0026rdquo;) as a property of those objects (\u0026ldquo;apartheid\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;the property of being separate\u0026rdquo;). Now, there are no scientific or philosophical objections to this view:\u0026lsquo;father\u0026rsquo; denotes the relationship of being a father of, whereas we ascribe the property of fatherhood to an individual. This is a permitted way of transforming a relational property between two entities into a dispositional property of one of the two entities.What then is the problem with \u0026lsquo;apartheid\u0026rsquo;? The only criticism one can have against apartheid refers to particular empirical policy decisions taken by the South-African government at some point of time. But then apartheid can be generalized, if and only if one shows that some authority in Indiaat some point took policy decisions identical in nature to those of South Africa. Of course, this is obvious only if one knows Dutch; ignorance of a language is usually not a good ground for moral preaching in the terms of that language.\nWere reservations then necessary to \u0026ldquo;establish the community of formal equals that is a precondition for nationhood\u0026rdquo;? This involves two claims: caste discrimination obstructed the constituting of a community of formal equals and this in turn prevented the Indian nation from coming into being. Therefore, redressing caste discrimination (through reservations) was a necessary precondition for nationhood. Wherever one may travel in this world, in every nation under the sun, there is discrimination between groups that are not just social classes. In the United States, for instance, there are ethnic groups (Asian-Americans, Indian-Americans, WASPs), linguistic groups (Hispanics), and religious denominations (Baptists, Catholics, Unitarians). In India, there are caste groups.In some cases, these are united neither by language, territory, or even religion (like Jain Brahmins, for example). In America, apparently, the existence of empirical groups and the undeniable discrimination among them do not prevent nationhood. How could caste discrimination then prevent India from becoming a nation?\nThe idea that members of a nation should all belong to one and the same community, without discrimination, makes sense only in one context: the idea of the nation as it exists in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. The believers of these three religions are united as a community in God, where they relate to each other as equals: the chosen people of God for the Jews, the communitas or ecclesia for the Christians, and the Umma for the Muslims. Each is a Jew or a Christian or a Muslim only in God. As such, in each of these communities, there is formal equality of all and this is what makes them a nation. Is the problem then that most Indians do not belong to one of these three religions? Is Deshpande saying that they should?\nDrawing on his \u0026ldquo;constitutional view\u0026rdquo;, Deshpande ridicules the Patidar idea that political clout determines whether a group gets access to caste reservations. But how does he have access to the true intention of the lawgiver or the genuine view that constitutes the constitution? How does he know that the Patidar idea of reservations was not the real intention of the lawgiver? Let us admit that some members of the Constituent Assembly shared \u0026rsquo;the constitutional view\u0026rsquo;. This does not show that this was the consensus or majority position of its members. During the decades before 1947, most people also knew that one could get benefits such as reservations from the British colonial state, if one had the required political clout. Today, Deshpande says, most people are probably unaware of the constitutional view and think like the Patidars. When this is the majority opinion both before and after Independence, how do you know that the majority of the members of yesterday\u0026rsquo;s Constituent Assembly and today\u0026rsquo;s parliament accept(ed) the constitutional view? How can you show that the proclamations of a couple of members are not simply expressions of opposition to the majority view (\u0026rsquo;the Patidar idea\u0026rsquo;)? You cannot. Thus, it is advisable that sociologists do not try to play the role of the sovereign lawgiver (or worse, usurp the place of God).\nThe Patidar idea of reservations was not always the same: they shifted from opposing caste-based reservations in the 1980s to demanding them today. Why? The answer is simple for Deshpande: the dominant groups in Gujarat first pioneered \u0026ldquo;the rhetoric of merit\u0026rdquo; and are now giving up \u0026ldquo;the sanctimony of merit,\u0026rdquo; because they are facing more and more competition. Apparently, merit is no more than \u0026lsquo;rhetoric\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;sanctimony\u0026rsquo;. This could entail two things: either one says that there are some domains where the conditions of entry have nothing to do with what merit is (namely, more knowledge, skill, capacities, competency … than other candidates) or one means to say that this is the case in all domains.\nNo matter what Deshpande intends, the unfortunate fact is that reservations in India are imposed onto institutions where merit is absolutely necessary: schools, universities, the bureaucracy, and public firms. Instead of merit, the reservation system draws on extra-cognitive conditions. Since cognitive conditions are essential to these institutions, however, one is compelled to bring them in again, but one does so in the inverse way: incompetence, ignorance and being deskilled become the criteria for entry.By adding caste certificates as the sole criterion, one simply conceals the fact that these three are now the criteria.\nThere is more deception involved: by drawing on cognitive criteria in this perverse way and acting as though one uses other criteria, one is blinded to the fact that the system has totally perverse effects. The use of non-cognitive criteria encourages more and more people not only to try to satisfy these criteria (by getting caste certificates) but also begin to live up to the cognitive criteria actually used (ignorance and incompetence). In other words, they simply try to live up to the standards demanded by the system. This is the growing tendency.\nThis explains why reservations do not cause movement from the reserved categories to the general category; instead, they reinforce movements in the other direction. That is also why we see ever more demands to increase the percentage of the reserved seats and reduce that of the general category, rather than the other way round. To use political clout to do so is simply to add another non-cognitive criterion to the already existing one. Given these facts, the general category cannot and will never reflect the caste composition of India, even though this is the goal of the reservation system and the precondition for its abolition, according to Deshpande.\nLike the reservation system itself, Deshpande\u0026rsquo;s discourse embodies the art of skillfully moving back and forth between ignorance and deception. That the demonstration of this art has apparently become the condition of entry for a social scienceprofessorship at Delhi University merely confirms what I have said so far. If this is the level of Indian sociology today, then it does not bode well for the future.\n","tags":[],"title":"Between ignorance and deception: Satish Deshpande's idea of reservations","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/between-ignorance-and-deception-idea-of-reservations/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","published","reservations","dailyo"],"content":"Increasingly loud voices are to be heard from different capital cities in India about growing intolerance in Indian society. The western press picks up echoes and magnifies them, while ridiculing Modi’s visit to Great Britain. While one can understand that Indians chant mantras, why are Europeans reproducing them? Looking from the outside, this is a very puzzling phenomenon. Because it is unclear what exactly is at stake here, I’d like to raise some questions and reflect about them.\nPerhaps it is the case that some people are protesting against murders in the name of “intolerance”. May be, it is true that people are murdered because the others are intolerant of them. But people are not protesting against increasing crime rate in India. India does not lead the world in terms of murders.\nIt could be that people see growing intolerance in murders of specific people. Consider, for example, the case of Kalburgi which sparked off the controversy. Kalburgi was an intolerant man in many senses of the term. He was intolerant of murthi-puja, which, with the glorious pretention characteristic of Indian intellectuals, he called idol worship not knowing what that word signifies in Semitic theology or why it is a sin. He was totally intolerant of ideas that differed from his: he led a delegation of similar people to meet the owner of a Kannada daily newspaper successfully demanding that a column gets shut downbecause it propagated an unorthodox interpretation of Veerashaiva thinkers in Karnataka. He led another delegation to meet the current congress chief minister in Karnataka asking and effectively shutting down a research centre because he did not like its scientific research results. From the time he was the vice-chancellor of Hampi University to his last day, stories abound about his moral and intellectual integrity that puts the legendary Chhota Rajan to shame. It is completely unclear whether his intolerance led to his murder or, as dominant stories circulating in Karnataka say, it has to do with his allegedly loose morals. Thus, if murdering intolerant people indexes the growth of intolerance in India, what exactly if being asked for? Murder of tolerant people?\nThe story of Dadri lynching is the next alledged example of growing intolerance in India. The story not made popular by the press suggests that the lynched Muslim stole a cow from the stables of another person. In the United States, for centuries on end, people who stole cows and horses were lynched. This practice was also rather frequent in the UK. While indeed such lynching isinimical to modern legal system, calling it an exhibition of growing intolerance is to exhibit an abysmal ignorance of human history.\nEven then, how should we respond to the fact that the next day, in a place near Mangalore, a street vendor who sold flowers was clubbed to death? Nobody speaks of intolerance on this issue presumably because the flower seller was a Hindu and the youths that clubbed him to death were Muslims. Perhaps they want to say that the growing intolerance has to do with murdering a Muslim. If that is the case, what do we say about the Muslim countries of the last decades? Muslims are slaughtering each other with a hatred not shown even towards dogs and cattle: Sunnis and Shias are murdering each other, blowing helpless people into smithereens, supported by this or that ruling faction in government. Yet, one does not say that there is growing intolerance in countries ranging from Saudi Arabia to Lebanon. Instead, they only say that there is an ongoing war against terrorism. So, when slaughtering Muslims is tolerated and cheered across the globe, one cannot say that the genteel folk in India see a growing intolerance in this society because of the murder of a single Muslim, while they maintain stony silence about blasts in Afghanistan and Pakistan.\nIs perhaps the growing intolerance about non-toleration of opinions different from one’s own? Two examples should suffice to answer this question. First, a mentally unstable person, called Venkat, also known as crazy Venkat, was dismissive of Ambedkar in a popular television programme. He called Ambedkar his slippers but no newspaper dared repeat what he said, except to mention that he made derogatory and abusive remarks about Ambedkar. It is completely unclear why derogatory and abusive remarks cannot be made about an individual. Characteristic of Indian colloquial speech is abusiveness towards everyone, including the Indian gods. Is Ambedkar superior to the Indian gods as well? The Ambedkarites in Bangalore surrounded this Venkat in the car for this remark, mauled and manhandled him and threw black tar on his face for this reason. The second instance concerns me: in an international conference held recently in Hyderabad, I was intellectually dismissive of Ambedkar and called him an idiot (I genuinely regret this choice of adjective: I should have said, “he outshines the genius of Alia Bhatt”).This “abuse” (as it is termed) has launched a campaign against me by the Ambedkarites in India: (a) asking the president of India to sanction me; (b) writing to the Honorary counselof the Indian Embassy in Brussels to revoke my visa and to prevent me from entering India in the future; (c) joining up with an LTTE group in Belgium, these Ambedkarites have complained to the rector of my university hoping that she would sanction me; (d) there is also a massive internet hate campaign against me in progress, including (e) complaints against me with the SC/ST commission, with the vice-chancellor of the university and governor of Hyderabad and (f) various vicious personal attacks on me. I was even subtly threatened with physical violence. Some Ambedkarite Christians (apparently they have no problems in worshipping two Gods) have even gone and complained against me for disturbing communal peace because I criticised some aspects of Christian theology, namely some elements of Christology.\nThese two incidents tell us that Ambedkarites are very intolerant of anybody who dares to criticise Ambedkar. However, this intolerance was a creation of Indira Gandhi in her attempt to break Jagjivan Ram that became a national policy in India. These Ambedkarites were fed, fattened and made intolerant by every single government beginning with Indira Gandhi. True, intolerance is growing against any criticism of any kind against Ambedkar; but this must be put at the doorstep of all the political parties beginning of Indira Gandhi’s Congress. The prime minister of India and the chief minister of Maharashtra of today are themselves so frightened of this growing intolerance that they miss no chance to declare their undying and eternal love and reverence for the Bodhisattva Babasaheb Ambedkar. No single intellectual has dared to criticise Ambedkar, with the possible exception of a journalist like Arun Shourie. However, this terrorist campaign of Ambedkarites has been going on for more than fourdecades but strangely this is not the growing intolerance which people are talking about.\nConsequently, the question arises: which intolerance is being talked about and who is promoting it? Isn’t it the case that the Congress party massacred the Sikhs but no intellectual responded in the fashion they are doing today? It is the same Congress party which is ruling in Karnatakaand is threatening politically neutral youth groups and youth movements with police complaints and court cases because they dare express their criticism about the government policies and challenge some of the dogmas of the Ambedkarites. Are we to assume then that intolerance is such a plastic word that one uses it to simply tarnish political opponents? One can imagine a Modi attacking a Rahul Gandhi about the latter’s intolerance; I can imagine a wannabe politician looking for a political position attacking Modi for being intolerant; sad though it is, I know many JNU and DU intellectuals jumping on this bandwagon hoping for a plump position in a commission. What amazes me is that no intellectual in India is even raising the issue about what the the current growth of intolerance means. Is one to assume that the last decades of reservation policy has inducted only servile and self-serving people to occupy the function of Indian intellectuals? If it is the case, as I suspect it to be, it is indeed a very sorry state of affairs that portends a disaster for the future. If it is not the case, I really would like to be proved wrong regarding my suspicion, here is my challenge to what is left of the Indian intellectuals: where are you, when intellectual pluralism is being slaughtered by the Ambedkarites? What are you doing when you fail to bring clarity to the obviously politically orchestrated campaign that prostitute ideas which intellectual your ancestors died fighting for? Have you really sold your souls to the Devil for a bowl of Mulligatawny(pronounced as “Malagu-tanni” in colloquial Tamil) soup?\n","tags":[],"title":"Which intolerance is growing in India?","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/which-intolerance-is-growing-in-india/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","Jakob","published","dailyo"],"content":"Our recent piece on the valedictory speech of the minister of HRD at a Kolkata workshop elicited many replies from the readers. Some found that we indulged in a personal attack, our piece lacked \u0026ldquo;logic\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;argumentation\u0026rdquo; and one of her secret admirers, in her defence, even sent us a link to a report by Saptadwipa Ghosal in The Echo of India. Such responses demand an adequate reply. Actually, we wanted to show how profound her new education policy is and we failed in demonstrating it. In this piece, through the use of sophisticated hermeneutics, we shall make our mistake good.\nPersonal attack\nAbout personal attack, one of the authors has met Smriti twice so far and his impressions of her are very positive. Though rumours are rife about her abrasive and arrogant personality, she came across as a nice, pleasant and witty person in her conversations with him. Nothing in our article suggests anything about her personality, whether positive or negative. In this sense, we could not have indulged in a personal attack.\nThe second sense of personal attack involves impropriety, whether understood in terms of some vague notion of \u0026ldquo;good manners\u0026rdquo; that is prevalent among the fake intellectuals that populate the Indian academia or in the sense of being abusive. Only those who cannot read a text properly would see a sarcasm-laden text as either being abusive or lacking in good manners. We have no answer to give to those who cannot understand a text or know how to read it.\nThe third sense of personal attack involves the fallacy of ad hominem criticism. It is very well-known in India because it is the only kind of \u0026ldquo;criticism\u0026rdquo; that Ambedkarites and their sycophants use: challenge and reject some idea because it comes from the \u0026ldquo;Brahmins\u0026rdquo; and/or the \u0026ldquo;upper caste\u0026rdquo; members. This \u0026ldquo;radicalism\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;social justice\u0026rdquo; which they are taught in the Indian universities, especially in humanities and social science departments, as a heroic and valid criticism is an argumentative fallacy everywhere else in the world. One cannot reject an argument because of the person who says it; the truth and the validity of the argument do not depend on the nature of the person who puts the argument across. We did not reject anything that Smriti said in her speech because of who she is but because of what she said.\nIn all these three senses, our article cannot be seen as a personal attack on Smriti Irani by any reasonable person. However, it did attack her ideas, if she has any worth calling her own, because they are asinine, silly and dangerous. The hyperlink that her secret admirer sent us makes this fact even more painfully obvious. Surely, some salutary words are required about the HRD\u0026quot;s ground-breaking policy initiatives, as The Echo of India presents them, and also to meet the objection that we presented nothing of \u0026ldquo;substance\u0026rdquo; in our earlier piece.\nApparently, Dr Nagesh Thakur, a professor at Shimla University, introduced the \u0026ldquo;10 points\u0026rdquo; discussed at the Kolkata workshop that the HRD is going to implement. We begin with a crucial assumption that this man is not one of Smriti Irani\u0026quot;s favourites. She appears to favour people in terms of their degrees of incompetence, immorality and corruption: one of the blue-eyed boys in the servile entourage of the minister, for instance, has \u0026ldquo;the UGC in the palm of his hands\u0026rdquo;, as one of his erstwhile collaborators proudly and openly declares today. In any other country, this man would be languishing behind bars; in India, under the able guidance of Smriti Irani, this man occupies a whole series of plum positions and lords over multiple commissions with many more in the offing. Thus, assuming that Dr Thakur is a man of intellectual and moral integrity and, therefore, not one of the minister\u0026quot;s favourites, to read some of the \u0026ldquo;most potent points\u0026rdquo; that came up for discussion is to taste the \u0026ldquo;most potent\u0026rdquo; recipe for generating instant ulcers. Here, we will look at two such.\nThe first \u0026ldquo;potent\u0026rdquo; idea\nOne ingredient in that recipe is constituting a \u0026ldquo;national education commission in India\u0026rdquo; that \u0026ldquo;will run independently, in an autonomous manner with integrated thoughts\u0026rdquo;. The previous sentence is an exemplary instance, if there was ever one, of disintegrated \u0026ldquo;thoughts\u0026rdquo; coming from disintegrating minds.\nArgument One\nWhat does \u0026ldquo;integration\u0026rdquo; mean in this context? This is not a word-quibble, when it is about a national education policy. One could speak of \u0026ldquo;physical\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;psychological\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;religious\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;spiritual\u0026rdquo; integration, for example, but none of these makes sense with respect to thoughts. One could speak of \u0026ldquo;logical\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;conceptual\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;cognitive\u0026rdquo; integration of thoughts in a sensible way, of course. However, this use of integration requires that one specifies the sets of thoughts with which any particular set of thought ought to be integrated. Should some set of thoughts, for instance, be integrated with \u0026ldquo;Vedic\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Upanishadic\u0026rdquo; thoughts? Or, perhaps, to aim at the highest and the impossible, namely, \u0026ldquo;integrated\u0026rdquo; with Ambedkar\u0026rsquo;s non-existent thoughts? This is not an avenue worth exploring while interpreting the sentence here since we will come back to this towards the end; besides, the word \u0026ldquo;integration\u0026rdquo; in this context qualifies the word \u0026ldquo;thoughts\u0026rdquo; to tell us something about their nature. The thoughts of the commission should not be disjointed but \u0026ldquo;integrated\u0026rdquo;, suggests the sentence. Thus, we have to look elsewhere.\nAlso read: Why Smriti Irani as HRD minister was a terrible choice\nArgument Two\nProbably, the HRD is vaguely thinking (even if in a \u0026ldquo;disintegrated\u0026rdquo; fashion) of the following two possibilities: (a) holistic thinking, or (b) inter- or multi- disciplinary thinking. Very frankly, we cannot imagine what it is to think \u0026ldquo;holistically\u0026rdquo; except in health care (\u0026ldquo;holistic medicine\u0026rdquo;) or in semantics (\u0026ldquo;meaning holism\u0026rdquo;). We doubt whether her blue-eyed boy that we spoke about or the current favourite person in her entourage would have even heard of \u0026ldquo;meaning holism\u0026rdquo;. Smriti could not have; nor could her advisor excelling in citing Sanskrit shlokas or those bureaucrats who are drafting the national educational policy with great care and concern. \u0026ldquo;Holistic medicine\u0026rdquo; cannot function as a paradigm for framing policies about teaching physics (unless her vernacular geniuses, unknown to the republic of letters but doing cutting-edge research in physics in Bhojpuri language, have come up with \u0026ldquo;holistic physics\u0026rdquo;) or Integral calculus. Thus, the only option is that the national commission has \u0026ldquo;integrated thoughts\u0026rdquo; in the sense that it thinks inter or multi-disciplinarily.\nArgument Three\nThere are only two kinds of people who can undertake such a task in, to take an example, the domain of mathematics. The first are the multitudes doing research in social, cultural, psychological and cognitive foundations of mathematics; the second are unsung geniuses like the Infosys founder Narayan Murthy, one such typical individual, who can hold forth on any subject under the sun with a clarity and originality that would put an Einstein to shame. Clearly, choosing the first is not an option: if it is, the national education commission would swell in size to millions with most of them coming from Europe and the US (unless, of course, Smriti\u0026rsquo;s vernacular geniuses in Tulu have accomplished this wondrous task already). That is because of the number of people doing research in all scientific fields and disciplines in this manner is not in single digits nor are they to be found in India. That leaves only one other option: induct windbags and empty heads to sit on the national commission on education. Now, this option makes perfect sense: such an illustrious bunch of intellectuals will truly be \u0026ldquo;autonomous\u0026rdquo; from all constraints imposed by disciplined thinking and \u0026ldquo;will run independently\u0026rdquo; of all scientific knowledge. Given that they will have no thoughts of any kind, being the null set, the group is tightly \u0026ldquo;integrated\u0026rdquo; and well-structured. Indeed, this is a very \u0026ldquo;potent\u0026rdquo; idea as the reporter puts it but one capable of destroying whatever little education that is left in this country.\nThe second \u0026ldquo;potent\u0026rdquo; idea\nConsider the next \u0026ldquo;potent idea\u0026rdquo; that the HRD is going to implement: \u0026ldquo;The new education policy must reflect Indian ethos and philosophies along with importance for all Indian languages in the higher education\u0026rdquo;. The italicised part of the previous sentence is a real humdinger. Let us reflect a bit on what it could possibly mean and what it will definitely entail.\nArgument one\nThe first question is: what is this \u0026ldquo;Indian\u0026rdquo; ethos? To use the language of the postcolonials in India, another pernicious group in the academia, this is a \u0026ldquo;contested concept\u0026rdquo;. That is to say, today there is a severe \u0026ldquo;power\u0026rdquo; struggle to determine the meaning of these two words. Once this question comes into existence, there arises their next favourite questions, which are inane everywhere else except among the postcolonials in India: (a) \u0026ldquo;who\u0026rdquo; represents the Indian \u0026ldquo;ethos\u0026rdquo;- the \u0026ldquo;Brahmins\u0026rdquo;, the \u0026ldquo;upper castes\u0026rdquo;, the \u0026ldquo;OBC\u0026quot;s\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;the Dalits\u0026rdquo;? (b) \u0026ldquo;who\u0026rdquo; speaks for these groups? Unless these two questions are \u0026ldquo;settled\u0026rdquo; to everyone\u0026rsquo;s satisfaction it is ridiculous to introduce it as the aim of a national education policy.\nLet us sidestep this issue for a moment and say that \u0026ldquo;truth\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;knowledge\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;intellectual integrity\u0026rdquo;, etc. are being talked about here. Would this do? No, it would not, because these are not \u0026ldquo;Indian\u0026rdquo; ethos but of every kind of serious research. Consequently, this is not adequate either. Further, does the education policy intend to induce an \u0026ldquo;ethos\u0026rdquo; of a people, an \u0026ldquo;ethos\u0026rdquo; of a culture, an \u0026ldquo;ethos\u0026rdquo; of a society or an \u0026ldquo;ethos\u0026rdquo; of a civilisation, or, failing all these, an \u0026ldquo;ethos\u0026rdquo; of a group that shouts the loudest (like the Ambedkarites and their sycophants, for instance), the \u0026ldquo;chosen\u0026rdquo; or the \u0026ldquo;best\u0026rdquo;? Or, perhaps, the ethos of doing research? The talk of \u0026ldquo;Indian ethos\u0026rdquo; is so silly in this context that to propound it as a policy measure is to out-beat the most insane policy that the Congress party ever implemented. And most policies of the Congress party regarding education have been insane.\nArgument two\nConsider the issue we sidestepped. Who represents whom and who should speak for whom? In India, this issue has taken proportions that defy even the insanity of lunatics. When, everywhere in the world, such people would be admitted to mental institutions, in India they become professors in the universities. The right caste certificate and the chanting the Ambedkar-naam with the right intensity and devotion will propel you to a state or central employment quicker than you can say \u0026ldquo;presto\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;abracadabra\u0026rdquo;.\nBe it as that may, these questions have no reasonable answers. In principle, anyone can represent and speak for anyone else as long as we know what should be spoken about. This elementary idea in political philosophy has escaped the grasp of Indian intellectuals because they are more than mesmerized by something that paralyses the brain completely. The best way to indicate that state of affairs is to provide evidence about the paralysis first and then go on to talk about the nature of the paralysis and its relationship to the national education policy.\nEvidences: People, especially the secularist intellectuals of India, are against \u0026ldquo;idol worship\u0026rdquo; and deny the causal efficacy of mantras in the real world. We are always doubly astounded by this phenomenon: how can people who are living proofs of what they deny, negate the reality of the foundation on which they stand?\nConsider the innumerable (almost infinite) photographs, busts and statues of Ambedkar in both private and public places in India. We do not know of a single secular intellectual who does not piously bow down to these relics of Ambedkar: they take out processions of his images, celebrate his birthday and mourn his passing, chant his name in great fervour and piety, name children, schools, hospitals, streets and townships in his name, bow down to his images with great reverence… And the secular intellectuals who do all these are supposed to be against \u0026ldquo;idol worship\u0026rdquo;!\nThis is true not just of \u0026ldquo;secular\u0026rdquo; intellectuals. It is more pronounced in those who are called the \u0026ldquo;Hindu Fundamentalists\u0026rdquo;. In fact, the fortune of Ambedkarites is on the upswing under the rule of the BJP in India. While the almost bankrupt Maharashtra treasury groans under the weight of drought and decades of incompetent governments, its chief minister spent nearly 50 crores buying a house in London where Ambedkar apparently stayed once. In less than a decade, that government will have spent Rs 100 crores on that house to transform it into a religious shrine. Fadnavis even declared Ambedkar to be \u0026ldquo;the\u0026rdquo; greatest Buddhist scholar ever. That being the case, we wonder why the Dalai Lama and others talk about Nagarjuna or Chandra Kirthi. Surely, \u0026ldquo;the annihilation of the caste system\u0026rdquo; is indescribably superior to the mulamadhyamikakarika of Nagarjuna.\nWhen Fadnavis waxes eloquent about Ambedkar and bows piously with eyes closed and hands folded before his bust, rumours abound that Modi is involved in serious diplomatic negotiations with the British government in order to allow extraordinary regulations to be observed in the Ambedkar Pilgrimage Centre in London: Modi apparently wants to forbid the devotees from walking in the pilgrimage house. They are supposed to crawl on their knees and lick the holy ground. We suspect that the British government is raising objections to such measures but, we are sure, Modi is heroically holding firm and affirming his Indianness and bhakti in this regard.\nOne wonders though why the entire \u0026ldquo;opposition\u0026rdquo; is silent about the Pilgrimage Centre and regarding such a conspicuous waste of tax payers\u0026rsquo; money. Would they show the same revered attitude if Fadnavis celebrated the \u0026ldquo;teen murtis\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;three jewels\u0026rdquo; of Maharashtra, namely, Ambedkar, Hegdewar and Golwalkar, in an identical manner? If Ambedkar, till the late 70\u0026rsquo;s an insignificant \u0026ldquo;leader\u0026rdquo; of a small minority, can become God of the Nation today, why not a Golwalkar who is also, by all accounts, a \u0026ldquo;leader\u0026rdquo; of even a bigger group of Hindus? Would the Centre in Delhi create study centres in memory of Din Dayal Upadhyaya or Shyamprasad Mukherji with the tax payers\u0026rsquo; money? To do so, it appears to us, requires acts of courage or foolishness, depending on where you are coming from; to do the same for Ambedkar merely requires servility, which Fadnavis and Modi appear to possess in abundance.\nAs far as those who deny that mantras have no efficacy in the real world, they seem to have no idea what the chanting of Ambedkar\u0026rsquo;s name causes: if you do it regularly, loudly, diligently and with the right amount of passion, worldly favours are granted, gates of power go open and promotions are guaranteed. How, then, can anyone deny the efficacy of the mantras when mere namasmarane of Ambedkar has these incredible effects?\nBack to the argument: If these are evidences for the paralysis, what is the nature of paralysis? It has to do with the psychological effects of joining a cult or a religious sect. In the India of today, Ambedkarismhas become a cult: to join it, you have to renounce your past (say, of coming either from the \u0026ldquo;upper caste\u0026rdquo; or for being under the influence of \u0026ldquo;Brahmins\u0026rdquo;); you have to punish those who refuse to be converted (the terror tactics of excommunication, brow-beating, physical beating, threats, letters of complaint written to the SC/ST commission and the president of India, etc.); you have to intimidate your opponents and reward the faithful; you need prophets and divinity; a charismatic leader… Every single property of a cult can be discerned in Ambedkarism, the religion of the Ambedkarites.\nA national education policy ought to set up research centres and institutes. It should not set up pilgrimage shrines and finance priests, Rabbis or imams to study their holy texts. The UGC and the ICSSR so far have mostly financed nothing except projects set up to study and propagate a cultic and sectarian theology. Under Smriti, this tendency has only been encouraged further. Her educational policy does not stimulate the emergence of science but the expansion of the Ambedkarian cult.\nThis being the case, we can now ask the question: Whose \u0026ldquo;ethos\u0026rdquo; is \u0026ldquo;the\u0026rdquo; Indian \u0026ldquo;ethos\u0026rdquo; then? Answer: those of Ambedkarism. Who represents that cult and can speak for it? Why, the Ambedkarites, to be sure. They do that in \u0026ldquo;the name\u0026rdquo; of the Dalits, of course. What is \u0026ldquo;the ethos\u0026rdquo; of these Ambedkarites? Look around you in the Indian universities and government institutions where they are in the majority, you will discover the facts of the matter. The second \u0026ldquo;potent\u0026rdquo; point transforms these old facts into the \u0026ldquo;New\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;national\u0026rdquo; education policy.\nArgument three\nThese facts are indicative of a process that confirms one of the oldest ideas about the origin of religion. That idea says that God (or gods) is/are human creations and that people transform some human beings into gods. That is the process that is occurring in India: in about 100 years, if things go the way they are going, Ambedkar will have become GOD and not just one of his avatars or reincarnations. Even if Ambedkarism always remains a cult, it will be soon recognised as a \u0026ldquo;major religion\u0026rdquo;, more important in India than, say, \u0026ldquo;Hinduism\u0026rdquo;. Indira Gandhi began this process in order to liquidate Jagjivan Ram and his influence on the Harijans. The successive governments since then have faithfully pursued her political strategy by transforming it into a national religious and educational policy. The current BJP government, under the charismatic and able Leader Modi, is accelerating that trend: never did Ambedkarites have such success as they have now. Ambedkarism is rapidly taking the visible shape of an institutionalised religious cult.\nHow exactly does this process work? As we have already shown, the namasmarane of Ambedkar has miraculous powers: it gives phala to those who chant it vigorously. To the individual, it gives worldly success; to the political parties, it yields them votes and brings them to power; to the Ambedkarites, it provides them the boon they desire, irrespective of which party is in power. This being the case, his texts obviously will have very mysterious and potent powers: if your read his \u0026ldquo;annihilation of the caste system\u0026rdquo;, your brain gets slowly but inexorably paralysed because the text takes over the critical centres of your brain first; if you read two of his books, your central nervous system succumbs next; if you go further, there occurs a total and irredeemable failure of both the brain and the central nervous system leaving most physiological processes intact. At that stage, you reach \u0026ldquo;Shunyata\u0026rdquo;: the highest state in the Buddhist tradition. However, Ambedkarism takes you one step higher: the world remains full and the entire Shunya remains only inside your head. If you persist, then you are elevated as a university professor and have a chance to become an acolyte. This religious profundity requires gospels written by prophets. Currently, many wannabes in Indian higher educational institutions are vying for the position of becoming one of His prophets by writing His biography. However, the competition is rather fierce, as Arundhati Roy discovered to her great discomfiture. Competition, we all know, brings out the best in people but Ambedkarism seems to embrace this principle only half-heartedly though.\nHowever, there is something \u0026ldquo;new\u0026rdquo; in the BJP policy as it is expressed in the NEP that Smirti has choreographed. The \u0026ldquo;ethos\u0026rdquo; of the Indian society that it wants to cement is to be found in the gopsel: not in the gospel according to Ambedkar but in the Gospel of Ambedkar, the holy texts of Ambedkarism. The objectless thoughts of Ambedkar (the highest phase in Zen Buddhism is to think objectless thoughts) will be \u0026ldquo;integrated\u0026rdquo; by the \u0026ldquo;autonomous\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;independently\u0026rdquo; functioning national education commission to provide the children with the Ambedkarite ethos, which is also the \u0026ldquo;Indian Ethos\u0026rdquo;. What more do you want? Truly, this education policy is new and unprecedented deserving of applause from all and sundry. Surely, our hermeneutic exercise has revealed unanticipated depths and the matchless profundity of thoughts that swirl in the cranium of the HRD minister, Smriti Irani, by now.\nConclusion\nThere are more \u0026ldquo;potent\u0026rdquo; facts to speak about, where each has the potency to blow the Indian Education system to smithereens, and they can also be rendered hermeneutically profound. To do so would be an overkill in the context of this piece. But we promise to come back to this issue again. Surely, the current Indian scene generates pathos: it has tragic consequences for the future of India. Every single \u0026ldquo;potent point\u0026rdquo; made in that Kolkata conference is chilling in its implications in terms of what it holds for the Indian youth. If implemented, as it surely will be, it will accelerate the process of disintegration of India that Indira Gandhi initiated more than four decades ago. Every single government since then simply followed the same course; today, the BJP is accelerating that process. The secularists and the Ambedkarites should clap and cheer: their dream is coming true at last. The BJP should be voted back to power, in case they do not achieve their goal within the course of this term. Kapil Sibal, without a doubt, contributed enormously in his own incompetent way to the destruction of the Indian education system. But his success in doing so does not hold a candle to the realisations of the most competent minister of the HRD we have ever had: Smriti Irani. She will completely destroy and decimate Indian education. The only \u0026ldquo;development\u0026rdquo;, to chant that famous Modi\u0026rsquo;s Mantra again, that we see is the accelerated development of the disastrous process that Indira Gandhi initiated decades ago. Perhaps, this is what the HRD ministry has been aiming for all along. All power to Smriti.\n","tags":[],"title":"Smriti Irani will destroy Indian education for good","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/smriti-irani-will-destroy-indian-education-for-good/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","Jakob","published","dailyo"],"content":"From the mouth of some babes, pearls of wisdom and truth fall like gentle rain from heaven. From the mouth of others, idiocies pour in a torrent and are considered truth only because they occupy positions of power. We leave it to the reader to decide to which group our minister of human resource development Smriti Irani belongs. Keep in mind that she determines to a large extent the course of education, including higher education policies in India. Irani\u0026rsquo;s comments on education at the conclusion of the National Seminar on the New Education Policy in Kolkata would be shocking if they were made by a mature and intelligent human being. But, as is said, from the mouth of the babes\u0026hellip;\nThe minister claimed that in India \u0026ldquo;a large section of research work is done in vernacular languages, whereas global rankings only consider research in English.\u0026rdquo; We are not quibbling when we say that research is never considered in global rankings but only publications, and prizes and awards in the sciences are. Of course, we can understand that the HRD minister does not know the difference. Why should she? There are enough dumb advisors to write the speeches she reads out. We are supposed to assume that this minister is able to judge the quality of research in languages she does not even know, whereas the \u0026ldquo;Republic of Letters\u0026rdquo; sadly languishes in ignorance. We are sure that there is research in Bhojpuri, which goes beyond research in superstring theory in physics; research in Braj which puts the Bourbaki programme in mathematics to shame; research in Konkani which transforms the paradigm of modern evolutionary biology; and research in Sanketi which provides an alternative to black hole physics.\nSince the minister is able to appreciate the quality of research in all these domains, the puzzle before us is really excruciatingly painful. Why does she not fund a massive translation programme that will propel humankind from its current darkness towards the light shining in her eyes, instead of asking advertising agencies to write documents about the future of Indian higher education? We are sure we will hear scintillating answers to these questions in her next speech. In the meantime, however, there is one more puzzle that confronts us. There are more Gujarati-speaking people than Dutch-speaking people; there are more Hindi speakers than German, Dutch, and French speakers put together. Do you think the Europeans are not doing scientific research in their vernacular languages? Yet, they do not languish behind in the global rankings the way India does. This raises questions to ponder, as we wait for the words of wisdom from the mouth of the babes\u0026hellip;\nIn the same talk, she admitted - ruefully, one would suppose - that there is a lack of awareness among Indian researchers about getting their research work published in international journals. This was supposed to explain the \u0026ldquo;achievement\u0026rdquo; of Indian universities and research institutions in global rankings. What breathtaking audacity! Scientific researchers doing fundamental work in nuclear physics in Tulu \u0026ldquo;lack awareness\u0026rdquo; of the top journals in this domain. There is a \u0026ldquo;lack of awareness\u0026rdquo; among Rajasthani mathematicians about the Fields medal and top journals in mathematics, even though they are re-designing and redrawing the structure and foundation of mathematics. There is a \u0026ldquo;lack of awareness\u0026rdquo; among the Assamese evolutionary biologists of perhaps even Darwin\u0026rsquo;s The Origin of Species, because it has not yet been translated into Assamese. Indeed, such profundities, such earth-shattering insights - as they say, from the mouth of the babes\u0026hellip;\nOf course, the minister hastened to add that Indian higher education institutions not figuring high in the global rankings did not mean that the country was lagging behind in quality research. This is a profound philosophical point, as it draws a fundamental conceptual distinction between a country and her institutions. The country is being led by the HRD department so ably guided by Mrs Irani. Unfortunately, this high-quality achievement does not figure in the institutional rankings, even though, surely, the HRD ministry is also an institution. Should the research done by her advisors and bureaucrats be taken into consideration, surely India would shoot into stratospheric heights in the global rankings. If only our higher education institutions were to follow the diktats of this department and its capable leaders, they would go to places where even angels fear to tread. From the mouth of the babes\u0026hellip;\nWhen you are sitting in Delhi, travelling in air-conditioned cars and business-class flights, we suppose you would not see the absence of research in Indian institutions of higher learning. One hears only the whisper of sycophants and the whining of third-rate technocrats who head such institutions. Anecdotal evidence about individuals leaving research centres to go abroad because of a lack of funds, is transformed into national policy. The pathetic belief of the HRD ministry is that an increase of funding to the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) and Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) will lead to a rise in the quality of research. When you have a third-rate Sanskrit pundit as your advisor on higher education policy, why would you need to study the sociology, history, philosophy and psychology of science to find out the problems involved in generating and encouraging scientific creativity? Your Sanskrit pundit will hunt out the relevant Vedic shlokas, whereas Europeans and Americans can do empirical research into science. Thus, you can initiate a glossy E UG Shala, whereas these dumb Europeans and Americans publish book series on the history, philosophy, sociology and psychology of science. Were we ordinary mortals to say this, one would be indignant with anger. But from the mouth of the babes\u0026hellip;\nThus we could go on. The point remains that everyone from the Yashpal committee onwards has recognised the absence of research culture in Indian institutions of higher learning. Owing to the equally breathtaking realisations of Irani\u0026rsquo;s illustrious predecessors like Kapil Sibal, the Indian education system will resemble that of Africa in the 1960s in ten years\u0026rsquo; time. Most institutions of learning have inducted professors on the basis of caste certificates, not on the basis of cutting-edge research in vernacular languages. Therefore, the only thing they can teach the present and the coming generations is that the Bible according to Ambedkar, which is not even the \u0026ldquo;World\u0026rdquo; according to Garp.\nUnless of course such vernacular teachings of the Gospel are also to qualify as cutting-edge research, our students will not learn anything in this and the coming decades. The secondary education system today - especially the central exams - is sustained by retired private tutors aged between 60 and 70 years. Unfortunately, old age and death do not obey the laws discovered by our cutting-edge researchers in vernacular languages, which means most of these tutors will die in a decade from now. Who then is going to teach our secondary school students?\nOur minister has a solution: she inducts the most incompetent educationalist we have ever met in our lives to be part of the CABE, just because he is her favourite. So we suppose such people will do all the teaching and tuition required to bring around our secondary school students to do cutting-edge research in even more obscure vernacular languages. But then we also suppose it does not matter, because as the minister said, these cutting-edge researchers do not need to know the top journals in their fields.\nThis is a sad commentary on the quality of the educational initiatives undertaken by Mrs Irani. Sadder is that when Modi mouths his \u0026ldquo;development\u0026rdquo; mantra, his own government is actually busy creating underdevelopment. Even sadder than this is to sell inanities as brilliant insights and initiatives. But this is not a problem, since Indians are used to tear-jerking movies anyway. They will just dry their tears about this incompetent ministry and move on. However, this time the brakes will be applied very rudely, because this state of affairs is generating a tragedy of gigantic proportions. What about the children and the youth of today? Who is going to teach them? The vernacular geniuses, we suppose. From the mouth of the babes.\n","tags":[],"title":"Why Smriti Irani as HRD minister was a terrible choice","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/why-smriti-irani-as-hrd-minister-was-a-terrible-choice/"},{"categories":["action","Balagangadhara","law","published","rationality","tradition"],"content":"There are three ideas in the West about Law that are taken as axioms. The first: all societies are founded on Law; if they are not, they ought to be. The second is that Law teaches and educates a people. Third is their corollary: only thus do a people become a Nation. As far as I know, none has shown their empirical truth or proved that they are logically necessary. But their truth-value is undisputed. When they ruled India, the British followed these axioms: they tried to educate us through Law, interfered in our festivals and social practices and the State tried to educate a barbaric people by enacting ‘just’ laws. Romulus gave Law and made a group into a people; Moses gave Law and made a people into a Nation; Mohammed gave Law and transformed multiple nations into a caliphate; Manu acquires the exalted status of a Law-giver for the ‘Hindus’. These ideas are not dated, apparently. Today, they enjoy the same privilege they had during the colonial rule.\nOur prime minister launches a programme, Swachh Bharat, enjoining the state to teach public hygiene to Indians. Strange, because most Indians are focused on their hygiene: Many bathe three times a day, even more do so twice and most at least once. Most Indians are keen on sweeping the floors of their houses at least once a day. Yet, our public spaces do not enjoy the same attention. Instead of figuring out how and why a hygienically oriented people think about public spaces differently, the state takes upon itself the role of a teacher that should educate an unhygienic public.\nA few years ago, I was invited to meet some sadhus at the Swaminarayan temple in Delhi. We were informed that my female students should not accompany me and my other male students, because these sadhus practise strict brahmacharya. My students were aghast at this discrimination against women, which increased when they discovered that women are not allowed temple entry during certain hours when the sadhus come to perform puja. I tried explaining to them that these practices are not directed against women (or anyone else) but that these are the practices of the sadhus as demanded by the vows of strict Brahmacharya. They were as unconvinced as my colleagues in Europe: It is clearly a case of sex discrimination. I am sure that it will not be long before someone in India steps to the court, challenging the practices of the devotees of Swaminarayan.\nThe courts would then interfere in the practices of a people: The Jains are violating the Law when individuals decide to leave this world in a way that is respected by a people; the people in Karnataka are not allowed to observe ways of serving in temples and perform old practices because they violate human dignity; the devotees of Shabari Ayyappa discriminate when they do not “allow” menstruating women to join some practices; one must follow Muslims and Christians in terms of dress codes while visiting temples; certain games and practices are not allowed because they inflict pain either on animals or by people on themselves. The list goes on endlessly. Practices of different communities, no matter how old and venerated, should have their foundation in law. Otherwise? They are barbaric, of course.\nHowever, what if the staid ideas from the West are not God’s Own truth? What if a society is not founded on Law but sees laws as a part of society that merely provide a reasonable solution to human conflicts? What if Law does not create a Nation and that groups become a people precisely because of the colorful variety of their local practices? What if Law does not educate people but merely regulates reasonable interactions amongst them? What if Law does not dictate how people live or die but allows old customs and traditions to do their work? Positive answers to these questions do not mean that one countenances all practices because they are traditionally sanctioned. What is being asked is something different: allow reason or Law to criticize human excesses but do not make either of the two into a foundation for human interaction. What does the previous statement mean?\nHere, the practice of slave-owning is not being defended on grounds of its venerable ancestry. Nor is it being suggested that the practices of a people, which is what tradition is, are immutable. After all, traditional pujas, say Ganesh Puja, have adapted themselves well to modern technology. Human traditions can be criticized if found unreasonable, which means leaving normative judgements behind, or when they directly harm others. But no evaluation, rejection or change of a way of living because, under a specific description, it violates some or another normative principle.\nHowever, going in this direction requires a belief in the validity, acceptability and value of one’s way of living. The way Christians and Muslims dress in their places of worship is not an argument for other Indians not to dress the way they normally do in their temples. How the West arranges its own society is not a knockdown argument in favor of its civilizational priority or primacy, or proof of the inferiority of other ways of organizing social life. While this consideration is perhaps abstractly acceptable, the Indian intelligentsia does not obviously believe in its truth. If it did, it is not possible that people seek the intervention of the apparatuses of the state in matters of human practices that carry the stamp of a tradition.\nLooking from the outside, my vantage point, the Indian intelligentsia is increasingly imitating the West. However, apart from its thoughtlessness, this move is not as simple as it appears at first sight. When we take over ideas from the West, we must remember to understand them as cultural beings. The culture from within which we look at the West and appropriate its thoughts remains undeniably Indian. As a result, what we think the state is, and why and how we use the courts of Law, have to do with the way we, Indians, understand the West from within the framework of our culture and traditions. What guarantees us that this understanding is not flawed? How do we know we are not distorting meaningful ideas in our attempts to follow Western axioms?\n","tags":[],"title":"Questioning the axioms","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/questioning-the-axioms/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara"],"content":"Check this: http://witness-to-our-times.org/\n","tags":[],"title":"An open letter to Europa","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/an-open-letter-to-europa/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara"],"content":"See Balu\u0026rsquo;s piece on Bihar elections, Nov 2015.\n","tags":[],"title":"Butchered in Bihar: a view from the outside","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/butchered-in-bihar-a-view-from-the-outside/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","law"],"content":"Check Balu\u0026rsquo;s piece on Derrida\u0026rsquo;s the force of law.\n","tags":["Derrida"],"title":"An Indian view on Derrida and post-modernists","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/an-indian-view-on-derrida-and-post-modernists/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","experience","published","reservations","interests","swarjyamag"],"content":"What happens to the future of Indian intellectual scene when most of projects driven by its intelligentsia propagate perverted truths for self-seeking purposes?\n“Satyam Vada, Dharmam Chara”, “Satyameva Jayate” are but two of the well-known Sanskrit sayings that are supposed to indicate the values placed upon truth and truth-telling in Indian culture.\nIt comes as a surprise, therefore, to read three items in the newspaper and a comment on a blog which seem to follow ‘truth’. But in such a way that it becomes perverse. Because all the four issues are important, I would like to briefly talk about each.\nRecently, the newspapers announced the decision of the Congress party to increase Dalit, OBC and tribal quota in party posts from 20% to 50%. It is obvious that this is a move resulting from the Patel movement in Gujarat and it is an explicit attempt to get votes. No sane or intelligent person in this world believes that any of the Congress politicians are anywhere interested with the plight of the oppressed. Counterfactually however, let me assume that all Congress politicians have noble intentions. What then, you may ask, is perverse about this news item?\nLet me explain:\nIn the mid 1970s, Indira Gandhi came into conflict with the then leadership of the Indian National Congress. She had to find the organisational power to sustain and expand her own split party. She knew too, that she could not do so unless she broke the old leadership. She required a new servile leadership that would be loyal to her as a person and not think of the larger interests of the nation.\nThe old leadership, whatever its defects, thought in larger terms, if for no other reason but for their involvement in the Indian independence movement. In order to achieve her goal, Indira Gandhi followed a three-fold strategy: a) massively begin inducting criminals into politics b) break the impact that Jagjivan Ram had on Dalits by buying Ambedkarites with money and political power; c) have sycophants sing the praise of her socialism.\nUnemployed and unemployable Marxists were readily available to do this job. Overall, she succeeded beyond her own dreams. The criminals were the battering ram that physically broke the back and the support of the old Congress leadership. Marxists were bought by professorships, control of the academic funding agencies and international travel. This three-fold strategy is so successful that 40 years later, today, each of these three groups have fused into one solid block. Ambedkar is revered as a deity**,** crime is common in politics as the scams testify (which only touches the tip of the iceberg); and the chairmanships of the UGC, ICSSR and professors elsewhere are ample testimonies of the literacy rate of the university intellectuals. One has to only look at the composition of staff in any state or central university to realise the extent to which criminality, incompetence and sycophancy have fused into one indistinguishable block.\nThis was the strategy of Indira Gandhi to retain power, which she did, until her death. In fact, she paid the price of her own strategies when she had to invade the Sikh temple to punish a group of people led by a person that she and her son had protected and brought to power. The deification of Ambedkar and the terror that Ambedkarites exercise upon those critical of him is now further legitimised by this reservation in the Congress party. The basest strategy of a politician, Indira Gandhi, today has become the truth and fact about India. She laid the foundation stone and massively funded the building of a mansion that houses and feeds hatred between groups, enmity between castes and violence between the Dalits. Her strategy to win personal power is now ‘the truth’ about Indian society. Servile sycophants who suck up-to the politicians and sell this story in the media and class rooms. The past is forgotten. This is the perversity that I am indicating.\nThe strategy used for breaking the impact of Jagjivan Ram is now seen as the true picture of India about the Dalits and upper castes. If you challenge the truth of this story, you will get physically beaten up, the way they tried to do it with me in Karnataka. (I am sure the mistake will be sooner or later rectified.)\nThe same day, there was another news item, this time about the MHRD. It is about “India-Centric” proposal to evaluate the Indian universities. If we look at the proposal, the only thing one can call ‘India centric’ about it is the use of two criteria: Inclusion and outreach. It is most humiliating to read these as ‘India’ centric. The Chinese, for example, also developed their own “China-centric” ranking system: the Shanghai Rankings. In a very few years, this ranking system trumped all Western rankings including Times Higher education Ranking. The Chinese succeeded in their ‘China’-centric rankings by becoming dominant in the world. This new ‘India-centric’ ranking will not go beyond the border of sycophants in the Higher education. I wonder what is ‘nationalistic’ about this, if one knows what nationalism is.\nThe newspaper item gives the impression that ‘inclusion’ is identical with‘affirmative action’. ‘Outreach’, one supposes, means that university should relate to society. Only someone with a profound ignorance of universities can talk like this. Outreach and affirmative action are uniquely American concepts. Caste-based reservation and affirmative action are the opposites of each other: the U.S. constitution explicitly forbids people being discriminated against because of their birth. But this discrimination is enshrined in the heart of Indian politicians where Ambedkar sits majestically on his throne. India encourages discrimination against people on the basis of their birth. This is not affirmative action in any sense of the term.\nAs far as outreach is concerned, one cannot understand what it means in India. American society has never produced a native intellectual tradition. It has survived so far, because, America buys also the best brains from the outside. (Of course, they also buy the worst, mostly social scientists from Asia and Africa, to showcase ‘affirmative’ action.) In Europe, by contrast, there is neither affirmative action nor outreach. In all European countries, there are rich native intellectual traditions and they do not have to buy people to survive.\nIndia, China and Japan are like Europe and not like United States. Each of these Asian countries has extraordinarily rich intellectual traditions. True, the university system is a foreign implant that has not taken root in the Indian cultural soil. This problem, however, cannot be solved by ‘outreach’; one has to find ways of linking up with the still existing intellectual traditions in India. Nor is the abysmal quality of social science research improved by sharing food with a Dalit. The advisors to the MHRD appear to borrow ideas from America and present them as ‘India-centric’. The perversity of truth here: to steal ideas, distort them (for example, calling affirmative action as ‘inclusiveness’) and present them as ‘India-centric’. In the current state that India is in, I cannot imagine any Indian politician from any political party criticising either ‘inclusiveness’ or ‘outreach’. Why should they? They have already sold their souls in exchange for a bowl of soup.\nMy student Jakob de Roover wrote an article few days ago applauding the genius of a Delhi sociologist, who wrote an extraordinarily sharp piece of the Patel movement. What this sociologist claims about the Patel movement is, in my considered opinion, the greatest discovery humanity has ever made that is light years ahead even from the discovery of either fire or language or the invention of the wheel. One of the reader’s comments on that article claimed that Jakob was ignoring the “lived experience” of the masses. This is true. This truth is about the nature of human experience. No one person can access the experience of another human being. This commentator does two things: s/he criticises Jakob for being human because he cannot access the lived experience of another human being. (I wonder what the contrast set is to “lived experience”; “dead experience”, I suppose.)\nFurther, there is also an implied suggestion that an irrational and immoral system, which the caste-based reservation system is, should be founded on such a “lived” experience. If the lived experience of some human being, whoever he is, justifies an immoral and irrational system, then this commentator should also say that the Eindlössung of the German Nazis, i.e. the genocide of the Jews is justified. After all, Hitler’s“lived experience” grounded it. The perversity here is this: the truth that human beings cannot access each other’s experience is perverted into a justification of an immoral and irrational system like the caste-based reservation system.\nFinally, there is the agitation of the Patels in Gujrat. The Patel community outside India, according to the newspapers, wrote to the PM asking him to return the $3million they gave him on his trip to the US. They want to give that money to the movement in Gujrat. Most intellectuals in the Indian universities see machinations, class and caste interests and anti-dalitism in this agitation. Here too, there is perversion: the genuine feeling of many people about the caste-based reservation system becomes an expression of sectional interests, where as the sectional and corporatist interests of the so-called Dalit groups are supposed to embody and represent the general interests of the Indian society. Only those who know what democracy is would see in this the perversion of democracy itself.\nIn the course of one day, the newspapers reported at least four perversities as truths. Each of these do appeal to one truth or another only in order to pervert them. I wonder whether this is a coincidence or whether it is the staple diet in India today. I do not know. But the fact that the bevy of brilliant thinkers populating India have not reflected about them and the fact that, in the last decade or so, both the UGC and the ICSSR have funded scintillating projects, which are silent about truth and propagate perverted truths for self-seeking purposes, I think, reveals something about the Indian intellectual scene.\nOne could say that I should be glad that I do not live in India because my intellectual career for the last forty years has been in Europe. A fair criticism of a man whose future is behind him in his old age. However, the rebuke does not address the concerns of those whose future lies ahead of them. I am forced to ask myself sadly: what about all those wonderful, creative and hopeful young kids in India? What about their future?\n","tags":[],"title":"How about speaking the truth about reservations?","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/how-about-speaking-the-truth-about-reservations/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","reservations"],"content":"Check Balagangadhara\u0026rsquo;s paper on Caste-based reservations and \u0026lsquo;social justice\u0026rsquo;\n","tags":[],"title":"Caste-based reservations and 'social justice'","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/caste-based-reservations-and-social-justice/"},{"categories":["Jakob","published","outlook"],"content":"social science debate in India has been hijacked by the struggle between secularism andHindutva for decades now. usually the Sangh Parivar is blamed for this turn of events. However, it could well be argued that the Hindutva ideologues simply adopted the stance of the secularists. Perhaps the best illustration is the case of anti-Brahminism.\nTo be against \u0026ldquo;Brahminism\u0026rdquo; is part and parcel of the political correctness of progressive scholars in twenty-first-century India, much like being against Muslims is part of the message of their Hindutva colleagues. This indicates that something is very wrong with the Indian academic debate. Promotion of animosity towards a religious tradition or its followers is not acceptable today, but it becomes truly perverse when the intelligentsia endorses it.\nIn Europe, it took horrendous events to put an end to the propaganda of anti-Semitism, which had penetrated the media and intelligentsia. It required decades of incessant campaigning before anti-Semitism was relegated to the realm of intellectual and political bankruptcy. In India, anti-Brahminism is still the proud slogan of many political parties and the credential of the radical intellectual.\nSome may find this parallel between anti-Brahminism and anti-Semitism ill-advised. Nevertheless, it has strong grounds.\nFirst, there are striking similarities between the stereotypes about Brahmins in India and those about Jews in the West. Jews have been described as devious connivers, who would do anything for personal gain. They were said to be secretive and untrustworthy, manipulating politics and the economy. In India, Brahmins are all too often characterised in the same way.\nSecond, the stereotypes about the Jews were part of a larger story about a historical conspiracy in which they had supposedly exploited European societies. To this day, the stories about a Jewish conspiracy against humanity prevail. The anti-Brahminical stories sound much the same, but have the Brahmins plotting against the oppressed classes in Indian society.\nIn both cases, historians have claimed to produce \u0026ldquo;evidence\u0026rdquo; that cannot be considered so by any standard. Typical of the ideologues of anti-Brahminism is the addition of ad hoc ploys whenever their stories are challenged by facts. When it is pointed out that the Brahmins have not been all that powerful in most parts of the country, or that they were poor in many regions, one reverts to the image of the Brahmin manipulating kings and politicians behind the scene. We cannot find empirical evidence, it is said, because of the secretive way in which Brahminism works.\nThird, both in anti-Semitic Europe and anti-Brahminical India, this goes together with the interpretation of contemporary events in terms of these stories. One does not really analyse social tragedies and injustices, but approaches them as confirmations of the ideological stories. All that goes wrong in society is blamed on the minority in question. Violence against Muslims? It must be the \u0026ldquo;Brahmins\u0026rdquo; of the Sangh Parivar. Opposition against Christian missionaries and the approval of anti-conversion laws? \u0026ldquo;Ah, the Brahmins fear that Christianity will empower the lower castes.\u0026rdquo; Members of a scheduled caste are killed? \u0026ldquo;The Brahmin wants to show the Dalit his true place in the caste hierarchy.\u0026rdquo; An OBC member loses his job; a lower caste girl is raped? \u0026ldquo;The upper castes must be behind it.\u0026rdquo; So the story goes.\nThis leads to a fourth parallel: in both cases, resentment against the minority in question is systematically created and reinforced among the majority. The Jews were accused of sucking all riches out of European societies. In the decades before the second World War, more and more people began to believe that it was time \u0026ldquo;to take back what was rightfully theirs.\u0026rdquo; In India also, movements have come into being that want to set right \u0026ldquo;the historical injustices of Brahminical oppression.\u0026rdquo; Some have even begun to call upon their followers to \u0026ldquo;exterminate the Brahmins.\u0026rdquo;\nIn Europe, state policies were implemented that expressed the discrimination against Jews. For a very long time, they could not hold certain jobs and participate in many social and economic activities. In India, one seems to be going this way with policies that claim to correct \u0026ldquo;the historical exploitation by the upper castes.\u0026rdquo; It is becoming increasingly difficult for Brahmins to get access to certain jobs. In both cases, these policies have been justified in terms of a flawed ideological story that passes for social science.\nThe fifth parallel is that both anti-Semitism and anti-Brahminism have deep roots in Christian theology. In the case of Judaism, its continuing vitality as a tradition was a threat to Christianity\u0026rsquo;s claim to be the fulfilment of the Jewish prophecies about the Messiah. The refusal of Jews to join the religion of Christ (the true Messiah, according to Christians) was seen as an unacceptable denial of the truth of Christianity. Saint Augustine even wrote that the Jews had to continue to exist, but only to show that Christians had not fabricated the prophesies about Christ and to confirm that some would not follow Christ and be damned for it.\nThe contemporary stereotypes about Brahmins and the story about Brahminism also originate in Christian theology. They reproduce Protestant images of the priests of false religion. When European missionaries and merchants began to travel to India in great numbers, they held two certainties that came from Christian theology: false religion would exist in India; and false religion revolved around evil priests who had fabricated all kinds of laws, doctrines and rites in order to bully the innocent believers into submission. In this way, the priests of the devil abused religion for worldly goals. The European story about Brahminism and the caste system simply reproduced this Protestant image of false religion. The colonials identified the Brahmins as the priests and Brahminism as the foundation of false religion in India. This is how the dominant image of \u0026ldquo;the Hindu religion\u0026rdquo; came into being.\nThe sixth parallel lies in the fact that Christian theology penetrated and shaped the \u0026ldquo;secular\u0026rdquo; discourse about Judaism and Brahminism. The theological criticism became part of common sense and was reproduced as scientific truth. In India, this continues unto this day. Social scientists still talk about \u0026ldquo;Brahminism\u0026rdquo; as the worst thing that ever happened to humanity.\nPerhaps the most tragic similarity is that some members of the minority community have internalised these stories about themselves. Some Jews began to believe that they were to blame for what happened during the Holocaust; many educated Brahmins now feel that they are guilty of historical atrocities against other groups. In some cases, this has led to a kind of identity crisis in which they vilify \u0026ldquo;Brahminism\u0026rdquo; in English-language academic debate, but continue their traditions. In other cases, the desire to \u0026ldquo;defend\u0026rdquo; these same traditions has inspired Brahmins to aggressively support Hindutva.\nIn twentieth-century Europe, we have seen how dangerous anti-Semitism was and what consequences it could have in society. Tragically, unimaginable suffering was needed before it was relegated to the realm of unacceptable positions. In India, anti-Brahminism was adopted from Protestant missionaries by colonial scholars who then passed it on to the secularists and Dalit intellectuals. They created the climate which allowed the Sangh Parivar to continue hijacking the social sciences for petty political purposes.\nThe question that India has to raise in the twenty-first century is this: Do we need bloodshed, before we will realise that the reproduction of anti-Brahminism is as harmful as anti-Muslim propaganda? What is needed to realise that the Hindutva movement has simply taken its cue from the secularists? Do we need a new victory of fascism, before we will admit that pernicious ideologies should not be sold as social science?\n","tags":[],"title":"The Indian Jews","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/the-indian-jews/"},{"categories":["Jakob","published","outlook"],"content":"This has been a tumultuous decade for the academic study of India. In his recent Offence: The Hindu Case (2009), Salil Tripathi provides a timely overview of the growing censorship and harassment that scholars working on India have faced. Not a pretty sight to behold: people have felt the need to ban books and terrorize authors, hassle teachers and disrupt classes, toss eggs at some and blacken others’ faces. Academics now run the risk of smear campaigns, court cases and physical intimidation; all because certain groups feel offended by what they write about the Indian past or the Hindu traditions. The facts are difficult to miss. Hence, the threat that Hindu nationalism poses to academic freedom has caused commotion around the world.\nAccording to Tripathi, the rise of Hindu nationalism is indeed the major threat to intellectual freedom in the study of India. In his essay, all Indians concerned about the representation of India and its traditions come across as bigots and prudes. The goondas who burned M.F. Husain’s paintings and ransacked the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute are presented as the extremist fringe of a ‘long arm of fundamentalism’ that also embraces NRI professionals and Western Hindu sympathisers. On the other side, Tripathi places historians like Romila Thapar and religion scholars like Wendy Doniger, who (so he claims) go as far as ‘the facts’ take them and are attacked for doing so (75-87). These scholars are presented as spirited fighters ‘arguing for academic freedom and the spirit of open inquiry in India’ (86). This way of presenting things is flawed. Like most journalists, Tripathi ignores another threat to intellectual freedom in the study of India—one that may be less manifest, but is all the more insidious.\nA climate of implicit censorship has long dominated this field. Not quite as spectacular as the rise of ‘Hindu’censorship, this is not the stuff of juicy journalism. But this kind of censoring is as harmful: it also moulds people’s minds in particular ways; it constrains their speech; it compels them to show compliance to certain dogmas in their writings; and, for the unlucky few, it may even end their careers. The difficulty is to identify the modus operandi of this form of censorship. Much like racism, it is only in certain blatant cases that one can say with certainty that it has occurred. Nonetheless, we have to try and circumscribe this obstacle standing in the way of a much-needed rejuvenation of the study of India. What follows are some impressions of the situation in contemporary Europe, India and the USA. Sometimes these may seem caricatures, but caricature is required to make the implicit explicit.\nIn Europe, the issue cannot be separated from the colonial past and the present state of affairs, where the old continent is losing its earlier dominance to rising Asian nations that outpace it in every way. In response, Europeans have developed a set of strategies to convince themselves that their civilization is still morally superior. Here, scholars of India have an important role to fulfil. Simply put, they are expected to do the following: acknowledge that India is indeed going through swift economic growth; next, point out that it still has tremendous poverty, the caste system, superstition, religious conflicts, gender inequality, exploitation, child labour, nepotism, bribery, revolts, incompetence\u0026hellip;; and provide appropriate details on these flaws and the necessary footnotes or fieldwork. In this way, these scholars should contribute to what John Gray calls the ‘comfort blanket against an unfamiliar world’, which Europe is weaving around itself. ‘Rest assured; we are still on top’.\nNaturally, few scholars today would be willing to state explicitly that the European civilization is superior. Yet, while they disavow Eurocentrism, they also reproduce a deep-rooted cultural asymmetry. When European scholars describe India, they tend to connect all ills and atrocities in that society to the nature of Indian culture. One links widow-burning, dowry murder, domestic violence, female infanticide and caste discrimination to ‘Hindu’ foundations. Europe also loves to celebrate Indian authors whose specialty is revealing the ‘dark underbelly’ of Indian society. In contrast, social ills and atrocities in European societies are characterised as aberrations: racism, colonial genocide, the two World Wars, the Holocaust, sexual abuse, etc. are considered as acts that deviate from the true temper of European culture. This stance of cultural asymmetry has become the hidden premise of the European study of India.\nHistorically, the situation in India has grown from much the same set of equations. The colonial state nourished an intellectual class that was expected to spell out and justify its \u0026lsquo;civilising mission\u0026rsquo;. The intelligentsia had to show how western political theory had laid down the way forward for India and how the state was the guide on this road. It sought to demonstrate that Indian history and society—and ‘Hindu religion’ in particular—embodied the negation of western liberal norms: inequality, irrationality, tyranny (at a later stage, patriarchy was added). The postcolonial state inherited the institutional structures and conceptual framework of its colonial predecessor and also its tendency to treat the human sciences as instruments of the state’s project to reform society. Crudely put, academics in these disciplines could play two roles: ideologues were to show the significance of some western political theory to India and characterise Indian history and society in such a way that the implementation of this political theory became the only option; fact-gatherers had to collect the data related to some problem for the state’s project of reform.\nOver the years, the fashionable theories shifted from liberalism to Marxism and back again. Generally, the adherents of this approach to Indian society called themselves ‘secularists’ and shared one central attitude: they were allergic to ‘Hinduism’. In the first five decades following Independence, these secularists dominated the Indian universities and established an intellectual and institutional hegemony. They wrote the textbooks and dominated the UGC, ICSSR or ICHR. By the 1980s, when orthodox Marxism had worn out in most places, the hegemony was so entrenched that it allowed a few universities and research institutes in Delhi and Calcutta to perform a role very similar to that of the colonial master. They imported the latest ‘radical’ fashions from Paris and New York to couch an old story in the newest jargon: they used Foucault’s ‘discourse’ and ‘capillary power’ or Gramsci’s ‘hegemony’ to repeat that the Indian culture promoted inequality, patriarchy and moral bankruptcy. Social scientists in the hinterland were expected to imitate the secularists from the metropolis. If they did well, they could end up in JNU or perhaps even be invited to the West. This hegemony of the secularists reproduced itself through different forms of implicit censorship: it determined what was published, where the funding went, and who got appointed.\nAt the same time, there was a growing sense of alienation between these intellectual classes and substantial layers of Indian society. The rise of Hindutva produced a backlash against the academic allergy to Hinduism. When the BJP came to power in the late 1990s, Hindu nationalism tried to displace secularism by attempting to take over the institutional hegemony and modes of censorship that the secularists had created. Now, Hindu nationaliststook it upon themselves to write the textbooks and control the universities and the relevant government bodies. However, these people had neither the education nor the sophistication to do so in the (relatively) subtle ways of the secularists. The crudeness led to outcries in India and the West about ‘rewriting history’, ‘the end of academic freedom’ and ‘the return of censorship’. The message to the Hindu nationalists must be clear: learn from the secularists how to practice the art of censorship in more implicit and subtle ways. Whatever the future may bring, the humanitiesin India have now been hijacked by this struggle between secularism and Hindutva.\nThe rise of Hindutva has also determined the current state of affairs in the American study of India and Hinduism. Here, the implicit censorship takes the form of a climate of fear: the fear to be branded ‘Hindutva’. There are three central factors in US society that have contributed to this pernicious climate. One is the large-scale migration of highly-educated Indians into the US over the last few decades. Affluent Hindu-Americans have been shocked by what the American schools teach their children about ‘Hinduism’ and India. Turning to the universities, they discovered that these often tell the same story, albeit with more theoretical sophistication. Many Hindu-Americans are highly successful in engineering, business or other professions; many also sympathize at some level with Hindu nationalism. Shocked by the western representation of ‘Hinduism’, they think they can now replace this with a ‘Hindu’ representation. They do not realise that it takes more than intelligence and professional success to develop an alternative to five centuries of Orientalism. After retirement, some of these professionals take up the hobby of writing stories about India that no intellectual will ever take seriously.\nThe second factor lies in the many forms of Protestant Christianity that dominate American society. The theological framework shared by these denominations inevitably transforms the Hindu traditions into a species of false religion. Naturally, political correctness no longer allows scholars and educators to speak of ‘heathen idolatry’ or the ‘cruelty’ and ‘tyranny’ of ‘false religion’. Therefore, they have turned to seemingly ‘secular’ depictions of caste, inequality, patriarchy and poverty in India to show that Hinduism is a pale and erring religion, opposed to liberal values. The earlier religious condemnation has become a social critique. Often, both go hand in hand. For instance, American evangelical organisations join forces with scholarly critics of caste to promote the idea that India should become ‘post-Hindu’, as in the case of Kancha Ilaiah and the Dalit Freedom Network.\nThe third factor is the most interesting: it is the potential for implicit censorship that seems intrinsic to the US academic world. This is difficult to pin down. The witch hunts organized by Senator McCarthy during the Cold War played a significant role in creating this atmosphere. The terror of being denounced as a ‘traitor’ penetrated the American humanities at a deep level. To someone who has no first-hand experience of the academic study of India in the US, it must be difficult to imagine the number of young scholars who say things like ‘this is what I really think, but I will not say it in public, because I’m up for tenure’. By the time they receive tenure, they have usually conformed to the orthodoxy.\nTogether these factors have produced an unhappy mix. There is a cold war going on between the ‘Hindu-Americans’ (and a few academic sympathisers) and the mainstream scholars of Hinduism. Academics no longer fear being called ‘commies’, ‘reds’ or even ‘heathens’, but now ‘Hindutva’ has taken the place of such labels in the study of India. If one makes positive noises about the contributions of Indian culture to humanity, one runs the risk of being associated with ‘Hindu nationalism’ or with the NRI professionals who aggressively challenge the doyens of Hinduism studies. The popular media like to represent these doyens as valiant warriors for academic freedom, much as Tripathi does in his essay. This is far removed from reality. The dominant scholars too impose dogmatic limits that one cannot cross without provoking their ire. Because of the significance of letters of recommendation, peer pressure and plain gossip in American academic circles, their forms of implicit censorship are highly effective in making or breaking careers. This has created a widespread fear of saying ‘the wrong thing’, which paralyses the study of Indian culture.\nIn one sense, then, the picture for students of India is even grimmer than the one Tripathi sketches. In another sense, there is hope, because times of turbulence also hold the potential for intellectual change. As students of India, we will have to take seriously the growing discontent among Hindus about the ways in which their traditions have been depicted. Some of this is inspired by an attempt to sanitise the Hindu traditions according to the model of Islam and Christianity and the prudishness of middle-class morality. However, other strands express a deep sense of grievance towards the secularist hegemony and the academic allergy to Hinduism. As long as reasonable and well-educated minds do not address these grievances, Hindu nationalism will be able to tap into the growing anger among Hindus and manipulate this to its own benefit. To address such problems, one needs to work towards a climate of intellectual freedom that has too long been absent from the study of India.\n","tags":[],"title":"How free are we?","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/how-free-are-we/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","caste"],"content":"I When I took the caste-system as an example, what am I doing? I am showing that turning the standard story on its head is a child\u0026rsquo;s play: caste has been said to be an antiquated, rigid, dogmatic, etc social structure, which is \u0026ldquo;very difficult\u0026rdquo; to eradicate. If this is true, most of the rantings seem to subscribe to this text book story, then this can be put on its head very easily. A word of warning, therefore, to those who ramble on about the \u0026lsquo;immoral\u0026rsquo; caste system: take heed! You do not know what you are talking about. The issue is not about whether there is poverty and injustice in India. Instead, it is about wanting to correlate these with the caste system. To do this, all one has to show is that poverty and injustice in India is the causal result of the caste system in India, whereas, in other countries of the world, they are the results of \u0026lsquo;something else\u0026rsquo;. No one in the world has been able to show this; if some among you have proof to the contrary, kindly demonstrate. Indulging in shouting matches is easier than arguing reasonably.\nI am aware of the Indian reality. That is the reason why I wrote this piece. A silly anti-brahmanism, which still rules the day, no matter how popular it is, does not explain anything. So, a mind-numbing litany of the stories about the so-called \u0026lsquo;caste discrimination by the upper castes\u0026rsquo; is not a substitute for a scientific analysis of the Indian society and culture. The existence of discrimination is not a proof for the existence of caste system in India; it merely shows that there is discrimination in India. More intellectual work is required to demonstrate this than rantings on a website. Reading the article with some care would have made this point clear.\nMy question is: what has India to offer to the world in the twenty-first century? This cannot be answered by speaking about the discovery of \u0026lsquo;zero\u0026rsquo; or any such example from the past. Even less can it be answered by speaking about what the Indians are doing today. If you do so, then you are suggesting that, as far as the future is concerned, India has \u0026rsquo;nothing\u0026rsquo; to contribute. You are, of course, free to entertain the thought that the past of India is the only contribution of India to the history of humankind. In which case, please say so. But keep to the question without bringing up irrelevant considerations.\nThe piece could as well have been written as a response to the some of the rantings on this board. A monotonous reproduction of accumulated prejudices, whether about the caste system or the Buddha, does not constitute anything but a monotonous reproduction of accumulated prejudices. The article suggests that critically examining such prejudices is the task of the future generations of Indian intellectuals. In this sense, many on the board confirm an implied message in the article: in the past, all that the Indians have done is to reproduce the nonsense that the western culture generated. Indeed so.\nII Assume that caste system \u0026ldquo;restricts free movement of labour for efficient resource allocation\u0026rdquo; (Shiva\u0026rsquo;s claim). From this it does not follow that wherever such \u0026ldquo;restrictions\u0026rdquo; occur, poverty should exist. All the European economies \u0026ldquo;restrict\u0026rdquo; free movement of labour. What kind of poverty are we talking about in the West?\nCaste cannot \u0026lsquo;restrict\u0026rsquo; any such \u0026lsquo;free\u0026rsquo; movement because there is no organization to impose and enforce any such restrictions. When you apply for a job in industries, they do not appoint you to positions in function of your \u0026lsquo;caste\u0026rsquo;. When people buy products, they do not buy them in function of the \u0026lsquo;caste\u0026rsquo; of either the owner or the workers.\nIf \u0026ldquo;feeding the parasitic class\u0026rdquo; (Shiva, again) is \u0026lsquo;injustice\u0026rsquo; then, all the countries in the world are \u0026lsquo;unjust\u0026rsquo; and, one supposes, they do not have the caste system. Therefore, the point if meant as a critique of the \u0026lsquo;caste system\u0026rsquo; fails.\n\u0026ldquo;The ability of the system to defend itself against external threats\u0026rdquo;. (Shiva, once more.) You would do well to read the article before criticizing. If the caste system survives as a system today, it proves that it has defended \u0026ldquo;itself\u0026rdquo; very well against threats, both internal and external.\nSuch off-the-cuff remarks (without reading the article carefully and writing unthinkingly) do not carry the discussion forward.\nIII To compare Europe with India, you say, is like comparing apples to oranges. Strange, coming from someone who cited arguments from economic theories: apples and oranges are both fruits and as such one can compare them as fruits; not only can they be compared but one also chooses between them when the resources are scarce! So, what point is being made by you? To say that \u0026rsquo;these rigidities are breaking down\u0026rsquo; or suggest that one needs to deal with the \u0026lsquo;qualitative and quantitative dimensions\u0026rsquo; is to say nothing with respect to the question at hand: you suggested that \u0026rsquo;the caste system\u0026rsquo; was causally responsible for poverty in India. Apples and oranges hardly support your argument about this issue. Speaking about \u0026lsquo;devising the metrics\u0026rsquo; might sound impressive; but it is empty in this context.\nI have neither spoken of \u0026lsquo;free choice\u0026rsquo; nor of any \u0026lsquo;open organizational structure\u0026rsquo;. Why bring up irrelevant issues into the discussion? You say: \u0026ldquo;Society has functioned for millennia as an ORGANIZATION that has imposed its rules and restrictions on social mobility, based on birth.\u0026rdquo; Ah, you see, that is what you have to prove. Simple declarations do not suffice in scientific discussions. Show that the Indian society has functioned the way you claim it has. Let me tell you what you have to do to prove this: lay the mechanisms of such a distribution bare. Until such time, you are simply repeating banalities, which are false, but which many assume to be true.\nAgain, you sidestep the question. By telling me that you think that \u0026lsquo;capitalism\u0026rsquo; is breaking down the \u0026lsquo;caste structure\u0026rsquo; to replace it with \u0026lsquo;social classes\u0026rsquo;, you have told me nothing that the Marxists in India have been proclaiming for a century. Surely, this is no argument!\nIV Let me begin by complimenting you on your sharpness: yes, I do not offer an alternative story (though I intend doing it); yes, too, to your observation that my argument requires more than the mere existence of poverty and discrimination to \u0026lsquo;prove\u0026rsquo; the presence of the caste system. However, despite this acuity, I am surprised to see you succumb all too easily to silly labeling: I am a post-colonial writer! I am not: I find post-colonial thinking pernicious, puerile and damaging. I do not say anywhere in my article that the British \u0026lsquo;created\u0026rsquo; the caste system in India, do I? Perhaps, your hastiness has to do with the fact that you read Nicholas Dirks as superficially (a commendable attitude, as far as I am concerned, because he is a pompous windbag) as you read my article (not at all commendable, if you ask me).\nI do not argue, in the confines of this article, what the West has done or has not. I merely suggest it. If you want arguments, you need to read my scientific writings and measure their value. To jump up and down about a talk, which this article is, lasting 15 minutes is to miss the forest for the trees and the trees for the leaves and the leaves for\u0026hellip;\nI do agree that one should leave a child\u0026rsquo;s play to children. But then, what should I do when the person who advises me about this does not even know what games I am playing as an adult?\n","tags":[],"title":"Common sense ideas about the caste system","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/common-sense-ideas-about-the-caste-system/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","caste","published","outlook"],"content":"Today, India has become a global player of significant political and economical impact. Europe and India are facing each other as equal partners in pursuit of greater economic and political co-operation. This confronts both India and Europe with a challenge. The intelligentsia, the business world, politicians, educators and others, will have to answer the following question: What can India offer to the world of today and tomorrow?\nI will not tackle this problem directly but instead take up one of its sub-questions: to whom is this problem important and why? I believe it is important to both Indians and Europeans but for different reasons. In this article, I will spell out and reflect upon some of these reasons.\nFor the first time in the last four to five hundred years, non-white and non-Christian cultures will have a significant impact on the affairs of the humankind. Here, India will play an important role. As a result, the need to explicate what it means to be an Indian (and what the \u0026lsquo;Indianness\u0026rsquo; of the Indian culture consists of) will soon become the task of the entire intelligentsia in India. In this process, they will confront the challenge of responding to what Europe has so far thought and written about India. A response is required because the theoretical and textual study of the Indian culture has been undertaken mostly by Europe in the last three hundred years. What is more, it will also be a challenge because the study of India has largely occurred within the cultural framework of Europe.\nIn fulfilling this task, the Indian intelligentsia of tomorrow will have to solve a puzzle: what were the earlier generations of Indian thinkers busy with, in the course of the last two to three thousand years? Let me use a contrast with the European culture to exhibit the nature of this puzzle and its importance to the theme of this article.\nWhat were the European intellectuals busy with, during the last two thousand years? It is almost impossible to answer this question without describing the history of Europe. Still, we can say they produced theologies, philosophies, fine arts, natural and social sciences … The list is so varied, so diverse and so huge that one does not know where to begin or how to end. Despite this, the fact remains: all interesting theories about human beings, their cultures and societies, which we use today, are products of the European intellectuals. So too are the institutions and practices that most of us find desirable: democratic institutions and courts of law, for instance. The sheer size, variety and the quality of the European contributions to humanity is overwhelming.\nWhat were the Indian thinkers doing during the same period? The standard textbook story, which has schooled multiple generations including mine, goes as follows: caste system dominates India, women are discriminated against, the practice of widow-burning exists, corruption is rampant, most people believe in astrology, karma and reincarnation … If these properties characterize India of today and yesterday, the puzzle about what the earlier generations of Indian thinkers were doing turns into a very painful realization: when the intellectuals of one culture, the European culture, were busy challenging and changing the world, most thinkers from another culture, the Indian in our case, were apparently busy sustaining and defending undesirable and immoral practices. Of course there is our Buddha and our Gandhi but that is apparently all we have: exactly one Buddha and exactly one Gandhi. If this portrayal is true, the Indians have but one task - to modernize India - and the Indian culture but one goal - to become like the West as quickly as possible.\nHowever, what if this portrayal is false? What if these basically European descriptions of India are wrong? In that case, the questions about what India has to offer the world and what the Indian thinkers were doing become important to the Europeans. For the first time, their knowledge of India will be subject to a kind of test that has never occurred before. Why \u0026lsquo;for the first time\u0026rsquo;? The answer is obvious: the knowledge of India was generated primarily when India was colonized. Subsequent to the Indian independence, India suffered from poverty and backwardness. In tomorrow\u0026rsquo;s world, the Indian intellectuals will be able to speak back with a newly found confidence and they will challenge the European descriptions of India. That is, for the first time, they will test the European knowledge of India and not just accept it as God\u0026rsquo;s own truth. Moreover, the results of this test are not of mere scientific interest; they will also have serious social, political and economic repercussions on the European societies. If true, the question becomes: what kind of \u0026lsquo;knowledge\u0026rsquo; about India will be tested?\nAs an example, consider one of the things that Europe \u0026lsquo;knows\u0026rsquo; about India: the Indian caste system. Almost everyone I know has very firm moral opinions on the subject. Many see in it the origin of all kinds of evils in India: from the denial of human rights to oppression; some see in it obstacles to progress and modernization and so on. I suppose we agree that we need to understand a phenomenon before making moral judgments. With this in mind, if you try and find out what this famous caste system is, and why people either attack or defend it, you discover the following: no ancient book exists that tells us what the principles of the caste system are; no Indian can tell you about its structure or its organization; no scientific theory has been developed that explains how or why it continues to exist. Simply put, nobody understands what it is or how it functions. In that case, how can anyone be pro or contra the caste system? If we focus on how people normally describe this system and understand how easy it is to turn such a description upside down, the absurdity of the situation becomes obvious. While emphasizing that I do not attack and much less defend the caste system in what follows, let us look at the existing descriptions and their consequences.\n(a) Caste is an antiquated social system that arose in the dim past of India. If this is true, it has survived many challenges - the onslaught of Buddhism and the Bhakti movements, the Islamic and British colonization, Indian independence, world capitalism - and might even survive \u0026lsquo;globalization\u0026rsquo;. It follows, then, that the caste system is a very stable social organization.\n(b) There exists no centralized authority to enforce the caste system across the length and breadth of India. In that case, it is an autonomous and decentralized organization.\n(c) All kinds of social and political regulations, whether by the British or by the Indians, have not been able to eradicate this system. If true, it means that the caste system is a self-reproducing social structure.\n(d) Caste system exists among the Hindus, the Sikhs, the Jains, the Christians, the Muslims… It has also existed under different environments. This means that this system adapts itself to the environments it finds itself in.\n(e) Because new castes have come and gone over the centuries, this system must also be dynamic.\n(f) Since caste system is present in different political organizations and survives under different political regimes, it is also neutral with respect to political ideologies.\nEven though more can be said, this is enough for us. A simple redescription of what we think we know about the caste system tells us that it is an autonomous, decentralized, stable, adaptive, dynamic, self-reproducing social organization. It is also neutral with respect to political, religious and economic doctrines and environments. If indeed such a system ever existed, would it also not have been the most ideal form of social organization one could ever think of?\nHow can we try to understand this odd state of affairs? The question of the immorality of the caste system became immensely important after the British came to India. Consequently, there are two interesting possibilities to choose from: one, Indians did not criticize the caste system (before the British came to India) because Indians are immoral; two, the Europeans \u0026lsquo;discovered\u0026rsquo; something that simply does not exist in India, viz. the social organization that the caste system is supposed to be.\nThe reason why I have spent time on this issue is to signal in the direction of a problem, which has very far-reaching consequences. If what Europe knows about India resembles what it claims to know about the caste system, what exactly does Europe know about India or her culture? Not very much, I am afraid. Precisely at a time when, to survive in a \u0026lsquo;globalizing\u0026rsquo; world, knowledge of other cultures and peoples is a necessity, it appears as though Europe knows very little about either of the two.\nPerhaps, the absence of knowledge is felt most acutely by the Europeans who invest in India. They rediscover that they are not well-equipped to do business in India. They understand neither the culture, nor the role of cultural differences in management structures and organizations. The books and articles on \u0026ldquo;culture and management\u0026rdquo; are full only of platitudes; on top of that, the newest trend in anthropology tells us that the notions of \u0026ldquo;culture\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;cultural differences\u0026rdquo; are almost of no use in understanding people.\nIn other words, I am suggesting the following: Europe\u0026rsquo;s \u0026lsquo;knowledge\u0026rsquo; about India will be tested during this century. What the Europeans think they know of India tells us more about Europe than it does about India. In that case, quite obviously, the earlier generations of Indian thinkers were not merely busy instituting and defending immoral practices. What else were they doing then? Now, the puzzle becomes very intriguing: what were the Indian thinkers doing in the course of the last two to three thousand years? What did they think and write about? Did they make contributions to human knowledge? If yes, what are they? Answering these and allied questions will become one of the primary preoccupations of the Indian intelligentsia in the course of the twenty-first century. This puzzle is important to the Europeans too. Let me say why by setting the context first. Let me sketch the context by raising a question: what has the world to learn from Europe? Here are the familiar answers: science and technology; democracy and the legal system; respect for human rights and ecological awareness; becoming modern and cosmopolitan… When such answers are given, one does not mean that the rest of the world has to learn this or that scientific theory, or a solution to this or that mathematical problem from Europe. One means something like this: the rest of the world has to learn a particular way of going-about with the world from the European culture. That is, one believes that this way of going-about is the unique contribution of the European culture, something that is absent in other cultures. Let us now reverse the question: what has Europe to learn from India? In all the thirty years I have spent in Europe and in all the thousands of books I have probably read, I have not come across a satisfactory answer. Most do not even raise the issue; those who do, mumble about \u0026rsquo;learning\u0026rsquo; things that Europe once knew but has forgotten since. How to understand this situation?\nThe first possibility is that there is nothing to learn from India. This is possible, but implausible. It is possible that, much like the \u0026lsquo;chosen people\u0026rsquo; that the Jews believe they are, Europe is the \u0026lsquo;chosen\u0026rsquo; culture from all the cultures that populate the planet. However, it is implausible because I have not come across any explanation for this \u0026lsquo;European miracle\u0026rsquo;. Nevertheless, if there is nothing to learn from India, we can all sleep peacefully: the world, as we know it, will not be disturbed. This is the first possibility.\nConsider the second possibility now. Europe has \u0026lsquo;something\u0026rsquo; to learn from India but many Europeans do not yet know what. Some give the following answers: meditation, yoga, notions of Karma, Vedic astrology… These will not do: not only are there native meditative and astrological traditions in Europe, but such answers are also inadequate. It is like saying that one has to learn partial differential equations from Europe. So, let me push the question further: what is this \u0026lsquo;something\u0026rsquo; Europe has to learn from India?\nAt this stage, I normally encounter silence because there does not appear to be any answer to give. Surely, this is strange: Europe has been studying India for centuries; it has colonized her territories and people; it tells Indians what is wrong with their society and culture… And yet, no answer is forthcoming. The Indians know what they have to learn from Europe and they have been learning it for centuries on end. Europe, by contrast, apparently has no proper answer to the question. By virtue of this, the second possibility, i.e. that Europe has something to learn from India but does not know what, is very disturbing. One culture, the Indian, has been learning for generations and centuries; the other culture, the European, does not know what to learn or even whether there is anything to learn. And these two cultures, for the first time in so many hundred years, will meet each other on the world arena as equals and as competitors. What will the outcome be?\nWhatever the outcome, the meeting between these two cultures sets the context for the puzzle I spoke of earlier. Let me remind you what that puzzle is: what were the Indian thinkers doing in the course of the last two to three thousand years? What did they think and write about? Did they make contributions to human knowledge? If yes, what are they? To these questions, we have one set of indirect answers. In course of the last three hundred years or so, the mainstream theories in social sciences and humanities carry on as though Indian thinkers have made no substantial contributions to human knowledge. However, almost without exception, this splendid corpus of writings about human beings embodies assumptions of the Western culture. Not only have the Western intellectuals created these theories in humanities and social sciences; they also express how this culture has looked at the world so far. Generations of Indian intellectuals have accepted these answers as more or less true as well. The future generations will not be so accommodating though: they will test these answers for their truth. Even today, more and more people in India are gravitating towards this kind of research. This is not of mere academic interest to such people, whose numbers steadily increase. More than most, they realize that answers to these and allied questions have the potential to ignite an intellectual revolution on a world scale.\nMy own research, and that of many more in India and Asia, is focused on answering the puzzle. Within the scope of this article, I cannot even hope to tell you what the research results are. Therefore, I am forced to take a rain-check. Nevertheless, let me indicate the far-reaching nature of these results.\nEven a limited acquaintance with the Indian or Asian culture tells us that their thinkers have also produced multiple \u0026rsquo;theories\u0026rsquo; about human beings, which express the way the Indian or even Asian culture looks at the world. Yet, these theories are also contributions to human knowledge. This knowledge is about many things: the nature of human beings, the nature of ethics and morality, how human beings learn, what happiness is and how to reach it, what we could know about human beings… In short, this is knowledge about us; it is also about what we can know, what we might hope for and what we should be doing. As the Indian and the European cultures differ from each other, so do their views about human beings.\nThe European intellectuals have elaborated their stories so far. The Indians and the Asians will do the same in the course of this century. These two sets of theories will meet on the world arena too, as equals and as competitors. Today, we think that the European story about human beings constitutes knowledge. That is because there are no competitors to this story as yet. How about tomorrow, when there will be competition in the marketplace of ideas, and Indians and Asians come up with other and different theories?\nSo, by the end of this century, there will at least be two different sets of stories about human beings, their societies and cultures. One that the West has produced and the other that India and Asia will develop. Only one of these can be true or both will be false. However, these are issues for tomorrow. Today, let us merely appreciate why the theme of this article is so important to all of us.\n","tags":[],"title":"What can India offer?","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/what-can-india-offer/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","published","reservations"],"content":"Read Jakob de Roover\u0026rsquo;s piece on reservations on dailyon.in \u0026amp; on swarjyamag. From the perspective of constitution, constitution debates, check https://www.academia.edu/16478230/Caste-based_reservation_and_social_justice_in_India\nThe problem that has plagued India since Independence has flared up again: caste-based reservations for education, employment and career promotions. In the last four decades of living in Europe, I have heard both sides of the debate. As an Indian living abroad, it appears to me that these debates actually raise one single question: Are Indians irrational or immoral, or both? This is the un-debated side of the reservation discourse in India. Let me explain. Is caste-based reservation a rational policy to follow? The answer to this question does not require a definition of ‘rationality.’ Instead, the issue is: does this policy eventuate in irrational consequences or effects?\nConsider two individuals: one outside the reserved category, the other within. The former knows that to get an admission in a good university, he should belong to the top 0.5 per cent of the applicants. He knows too that he will not be part of the very few, who make the grade. Thus, what is the most rational thing for him to do? If putting in enormous effort and taking it easy both produce the same result, it is rational for him to expend less effort. Consider the latter. He knows that to get a seat in a good university, he only needs 35 per cent. Getting more marks will not increase his chances. No matter how little effort he puts in, he will get the desired seat. As a rational agent, therefore, he too takes it easy. Because knowledge and competence are mostly commensurate with the efforts put in to acquire them, expending little effort implies equivalent increase in ignorance and incompetence.\nSince the caste-based reservation makes it rational for people both in and outside reservation to choose to be lazy, there is an incentive to remain ignorant, incompetent and inefficient. If this attitude is generalised (in colleges, courts and bureaucracy), it produces and reproduces such people. Result: the institutions they run cannot be more efficient than them. The inevitable consequence is the collapse of both the society and its institutions. That is how outsiders perceive India today: her courts, educational institutions, bureaucracy, police, governments, are in the process of breaking down.\nWhy does this rationality argument not figure in Indian discourse? There is a well-known answer: the reservation is the reparation for the injustice committed by one group of people against another over two millennia or more. In that case, moral considerations trump rationality. If we accept that it is irrational to follow policies that lead to the collapse of society because everyone is rationally encouraged to pursue irrational goals, the question becomes: is it moral to be rational?\nIn and of itself, there is nothing absurd about it. One can indeed speak of local rationalities, such as scientific, technological and ecological rationalities and raise ethical questions about them. So, let us ask: irrespective of its rationality, is the caste-based reservation system moral?\nToday, it is common sense to say that there is oppression of one group of people across the whole of India by another group of people spread equally widely across India. However, there can be no empirical evidence for this claim because say ‘Dalit’ or OBC (Other Backward Castes) is neither one social group nor one particular caste. Both names refer to sets of groups. It is only correct to say then that multiple groups have oppressed multiple other groups in the last millennia in India. One could, of course, name the oppressed groups as the Dalits or OBCs. Sadly, this fact of oppression is true for all human civilisations. Therefore, if the reservation system is a moral critique of oppression, it would have to follow that all other societies except the Indian are immoral, because they do not have such a system. This suggestion is implausible. Is the reservation system a payment for the sins of our forefathers, who instituted an unjust social system? This could be true, but only if one argues that the children of oppressors have to pay for the sins of their forefathers.\nThis moral stance is unique to the Judaic tradition, where the sins of the fathers visit their sons. No other moral tradition has coherently argued this. I am aware that some Indians do talk in this fashion but that is incoherent within the framework of Indian culture.\nRightly or wrongly, ideas like karma and punarjanma require that only the agent pays for his misdeeds. If one has to pay for the misdeeds of another, what do karma and karmaphala mean? The entire set of Indian traditions would become totally incoherent. Therefore, you cannot assume this ethical stance unless you are a Jew yourself. But Jewish Israel has no reservation system. Neither are Indians Jewish. Hence, this moral justification does not work.\nCan we not say that the reservation system is the reparation of past damages, whether inflicted on one group or on multiple groups? Maybe. In the case of the Native Americans, for example, the white settlers took away their lands and became wealthy as a result. The Nazis deprived the Jews: of property, wealth, and life itself. African-Americans were displaced and transformed into slaves.\nPerhaps, one could also address the British: for the damages inflicted by colonialism. In all these cases, a specific group appropriates unjustly what belonged to another specific group. Again, there is no historical evidence to indicate that there was dispossession of the property of one particular group by another specific group all over India.\nIf none of these arguments work, why does this policy appeal? Is it because of the demands of justice in general and of social justice in particular? If this is the case, one should give the criteria of justice and of social justice that make sense of caste-based reservation. Nobody has done so. Surely, those who question the morality of rationality mean something other than all these flawed arguments.\nHere is one such. Just structures are preferable, since they always generate just consequences. However, it has been shown that just structures, in certain contexts, produce unjust consequences. Therefore, this claim is not a logical truth; we are compelled to show empirically that the reservation system is not generating unjust consequences. If that were to be the case, there would be no Patel, Gurjar or Jat protests, nor Mandal Commission. Thus, the reservation system is not an embodied critique of a local rationality (‘the’ caste system) nor is it about the morality of rationality.\nConsequently, the caste-based reservation system is neither rational nor moral. One has to say that Indians are either irrational or immoral or both, if they defend reservation. The British were reluctant to give self-rule or independence to India because many were convinced that Indians were immoral and irrational. Looking from the outside today, one is compelled to ask: were the British telling the truth, after all?\n","tags":[],"title":"Indian View from Outside: Quotas, Rational \u0026 Moral?","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/indian-view-from-outside-quotas-rational-moral/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","Jakob","published","secularism"],"content":"The relation between religion and politics remains one of the important issues of our time. The discussions on this relation swing between two extremes: religious fundamentalism and liberal secularism. These are regarded as opposites. As the liberal perspective sees it, the secular state and its principles of neutrality and toleration are antidotes to religious fundamentalism[1]. Recently, this view has been challenged. Several authors point out that fundamentalism and secularism are not self-contained opposites, but are intertwined in significant ways[2].\nIndia offers a fascinating case in point. In the 1980s, Ashis Nandy and T.N. Madan suggested a causal link between the elitist and statist imposition of secularism and the rise of the Hindu right[3]. Originally greeted with horror by secularists everywhere, this claim has grown in popularity, even though the objections it faces are many[4]. The alleged link between secularism and fundamentalism has not been adequately clarified. Its plausibility depends largely upon two beliefs: (a) secular statecraft is responsible for the escalation of religious strife in Indian society; and (b) the marginalization of religion inevitably generates a backlash.\nNeither conceptually nor historically has satisfactory evidence been provided for the claim that secularism and fundamentalism are two faces of the same coin. The rising Hindu-Muslim conflict in India could have many other causes, independent of the workings of the liberal secular state. It may as well be blamed on the failure of the Indian state to be truly secular and neutral [5]. The marginalization hypothesis projects psychological notions of repression onto the social dynamics of religion, but it is doubtful that these can be understood in terms that apply to individual psychologies.\nThe question is far too important, however, to leave the argument unexamined. If one can demonstrate that the secular state gave rise to the Hindu right in India, then our understanding of the relation between secularism and fundamentalism may be due for revision. Some evidence is available for such a link. It has been argued that Hindu nationalists appropriated the colonial state’s view of the Hindu traditions as a unified religion and its notion of Indian history as a struggle between Hinduism and Islam[6]. Our question is: what has been the historical relation between the secular state and religious fundamentalism in India?\nI\nThe problem of Hindu fundamentalism is different than it is in Christianity or Islam. Before the nineteenth century, militant traditions existed within the Hindu fold[7], but these did not aspire to found Indian society on a set of Hindu doctrines or principles. Moreover, no text, teaching, or body of law was considered central to all Hindu traditions. While it has been argued that the notion of a monolithic Hindu religion itself is a colonial construction[8], this has been challenged by other scholars[9].\nWherever the truth lies, the early modern encounters between Europe and India present a striking fact: when Christian travelers, merchants and missionaries denounced the native traditions as “false religion,” and preached conversion to “true religion,” the Indians reacted with incomprehension. They failed to grasp how one religion could be true and others false, and how different religions could be considered as rivals[10]. To charges of falsity and idolatry, they replied that their ancestral traditions were very old and could not therefore be false[11]. Before the late eighteenth century, Hindus did not defend their traditions in terms of doctrinal truth or texts: the tendency to provide a foundation for ancestral practices in “true” scriptures was largely absent[12].\nThe history of the Hindu right, on the contrary, reads as a quest for a common set of teachings and principles, around which all Hindus should unite. Moreover, its advocates argue that Muslim and Christian minorities should also accept these. This movement, then, is Hindu fundamentalist in the sense that it aspires to establish Indian society on the foundation of supposedly Hindu principles. The content of the principles has varied over time and this tendency is but one strand within Hindu nationalism. Still, we can isolate certain properties that characterize this movement.\nThe first property lies in the pursuit of a discrete core that unites followers of indigenous Indian traditions (Hindutva or “Hindu-ness” includes Buddhist, Sikh, Jain and the tribal traditions). The main ideologue of the movement, V.D. Savarkar, identified this core in his Hindutva: Who is a Hindu? (1923)[13]. As he put it in his 1937 presidential speech for the Hindu Mahasabha, an early Hindu nationalist organization: “Hindudom is bound and marked out as a people and a nation by themselves not only by the tie of a common Holy Land in which their religion took birth but by the ties of a common culture, a common language, a common history and essentially a common fatherland as well.”[14]\nAs a second property, this “Hindudom” was taken to give followers of these traditions a common identity and interests, which separate them from Muslims and Christians. The latter were “excluded from claiming themselves as Hindus,”[15] since they had extra-territorial loyalties and lacked the true Hindu spirit. However, this is not an ancient opposition. Medieval Sanskrit texts, for instance, do not identify Muslims along religious lines[16]. Even today, traditions that combine both Hindu and Muslim practices continue to exist throughout the Indian subcontinent[17]. Yet the drive of Hindu fundamentalism is to create an identity that separates Hindus from others. Religion becomes the marker of the “religious brotherhood” of truly loyal Indians[18], as opposed to Christians and Muslims.\nThis identity has proved difficult to find: no practice or doctrine is shared by all Hindus. Many of their attitudes are common also among Indian Muslims and Christians. Hindu fundamentalism is unique in the sense that it cannot draw upon any dogma or holy book. Throughout its history, it has nevertheless tried to do so[19]. Noting the Christian call for religious revival, a Hindu nationalist leader, B.S. Moonje, argued in 1944 that Hindus must develop the boldness to strive for the revival of their religion, and that “the constitution of Hindustan, the land of the Hindus, should be based upon the Vedas as the constitutions of the lands of…Christianity and Islam are to be based on the revival of these religions.”[20] Paradoxically, Hindu fundamentalism tries to distinguish Hindu identity from that of Muslims and Christians, while it models itself upon Islam and Christianity.\nThe third property is even more paradoxical. The lack of dogmas shared by Hindus gives rise to the claim that they hold principles of tolerance in common. In words spoken at a Hindu Mahasabha meeting in 1939, “Hindus, by religion and culture, are tolerant of the presence in their midst of people of other faiths.”[21] The principles are variously called as “Hindu tolerance,” “positive secularism,” or “equality of religions.”[22] These are traced to Sanskrit aphorisms, which became the “doctrines” of Hindutva[23]. These are then invoked to contrast Hindu identity to the fanatic theocratic nature of its rivals, Islam and Christianity[24].\nSubsequently, these principles are imposed on Muslims and Christians: “In Indian thought, identity of underlying reality permits variety of surface custom or even philosophical view. But the difference or diversity or variety should not oppose the underlying reality. Difference should realise its common root in the identity.”[25] Therefore, religions can be accepted only in so far as they conform to this underlying identity. This inspires legal measures against proselytization, a practice regarded as a violation of religious equality. It is argued that Muslims should rewrite the Koran to accommodate the equality of religions and that Christians should “Indianize” their churches[26]. Made into a sacred principle, “Hindu tolerance” becomes a ground for intolerance towards Islam and Christianity.\nA historical explanation of Hindu fundamentalism needs to account for the emergence of this paradox. Why and when did the inclination to found Hindu traditions and their practices in a common core of principles come into being? Why did followers of these traditions begin to perceive Islam and Christianity as rival religions with incompatible doctrines, if this experience was largely absent before the late eighteenth century? These are the puzzles we will set out to solve.\nWe will outline the genesis of Hindu fundamentalism in terms of four historical and conceptual moments. The first is a moment of radical transformation: the attempt to transform the Hindu traditions and their variety of practices, attitudes and stories into a set of scripturally sanctioned doctrines. We argue that the colonial state and its principles of toleration and neutrality were the forces behind this transformation. The second moment involves the responses of Indian public intellectuals: there we see an altered pattern of agreement and dissent emerge. The third moment conceptually traces the resultant distortions when this pattern took root in the Indian public life. In the fourth moment, we suggest that a normative disjunction occurred in the Indian social life that narrowed the options open to the Indian society and state.\nII\nThe first moment has its focus in the policy decisions that had to be made when the East India Company became a governing power in Bengal. What should be the stance of the colonial state towards native beliefs and practices? In 1793, it was decided that the laws of the Koran and the “Shaster” would be preserved in civil and religious usages[27]. Time and again, colonial officials stated “that it is a fundamental principle of the British government, to allow the most complete toleration in matters of religion, to all classes of its native subjects.”[28] In this sense, British colonialism established a liberal state in India, which repeatedly reaffirmed “its ancient policy of perfect neutrality in matters affecting the religion of the people of India.”[29]\nWhen the Bengal government faced shocking practices such as child sacrifice and widow burning, its first step was to decide whether or not such practices were “founded in the religious opinions of the Hindoos” and “grounded in any precept of their law.”[30] The pundits or Hindu scholars employed at the colonial courts had to give judgment on such issues. If they came to the conclusion that a practice had scriptural foundations, then the colonial state had to tolerate it.\nFor instance, a Bengal court case concerned a Muslim who buried his leprous mother-in-law alive, after she had requested him to burn her. The court stated that, while this Muslim had to be convicted, in the case of a Hindu indicted for a similar offence, the judgment of the pundits showed “that the prisoner was justified by the ordinances of the Hindoo faith in assisting at the suicide of a leper.” As a judge had remarked in an earlier case: “I am assured, that in the case of Hindoos it is countenanced and enjoined by their religion.” The Hindu pundits quoted the “Brahma Poorana” to show that the act was indeed “sanctioned by the Shaster.”[31] Consequently, the state ought to allow it among Hindus.\nPerhaps the most shocking custom was that “of offering human sacrifice to the Ganges, where they are devoured by the sharks.” A similar debate ensued here. One decided that the practice could not be stopped among the aged and infirm, since it was considered by Hindus “instrumental to their happiness in a future state of existence” and “sanctioned by express tenets in their most sacred books.” Where it concerned children, however, officials found that the custom “stands not either on the prescriptive laws of antiquity, or on any tenet of the Shanscrit.” Consequently, a law was enacted in March 1802, which declared any person guilty of murder, who assisted in forcing “any individual to be a victim of this superstition.”[32] Of female infanticide, it was similarly concluded that it has “not the sanction of any religion, or of any law” and could therefore be abolished[33].\nHowever, in the case of a widow, who was “at her own request, buried alive with her deceased husband,” the judgment was different: “It appearing from the answer of the pundits…that the practice in question is authorized by the Shasters, I am directed to communicate to you the opinion of the court that no prosecution should be instituted against the persons who may have been concerned in the interment of the woman…; provided however, of course, that those persons are of the Hindoo persuasion, and not otherwise.”[34] Thus, the decision was negative for women of the “joogee cast who have buried themselves alive with their husbands,” because “from the answer of the pundit of this court on the subject,” it appeared that this sacrifice “is not tolerated by the Shaster.”[35]\nThe debate on the toleration of sati or widow-burning revolved around the same issue of scriptural sanctions[36]. Later in the century, the same question would be raised about other customs, such as hook-swinging, which was abolished given the absence of textual justifications[37].\nThis policy of the colonial state introduced the tendency to found practices in scriptures and doctrines. It involved almost a coercive mechanism to this effect. Indians were informed by the government that their practices would be allowed, if they could prove that these had doctrinal foundations. Hence, not only the pundits in the courts but also Hindus in society set out on a mission to find scriptural sanctions for any number of practices. This turned into a systematic strategy to defend the validity of ancestral traditions.\nIII\nHow to make sense of the colonial policy of religious toleration? One approach would be to attribute certain motives to the British: e.g., to avoid rebellion, they wanted to appease the native religious inclinations. However, colonial toleration was a macro-policy, a cooperative result of the activities of multiple agents. One cannot impute intentions and multiple contradictory motives to account for such a macro-policy, as though it expressed the beliefs of individual agents. Moreover, a series of different “motives” for toleration can be discerned in colonial writings: from a prudential fear of alienating native subjects to principles of religious liberty. This generates a thorny question: which of these was the “true intention” or “real motive” for the toleration policy?\nA scientific answer to this question is not forthcoming: we lack a clear understanding of the relation between an agent and his/her motive, let alone possessing a social psychology of collective agencies. In the absence of such knowledge, if one explains the policies of the colonial state as though it had “motives,” one commits category mistakes: one ascribes a common-sense conception of the relation between motive and act (attributable only to individuals) to collective or supra-individual agencies.\nWe would like to suggest an alternative approach to make sense of colonial toleration as a reasonable macro-policy. If the colonial state and its officials consistently acted in a specific way, then we need to describe this as a collective act of reasonable agents. We use the term “reasonable” in two minimal senses here. Firstly, the notion is context-dependent: what is reasonable in one context might not be reasonable in another. Secondly, it is proposed as a condition for cognitive consistency. That is to say, one should attempt to show that the policy plausibly follows from cognitive assumptions that we expect a people in a period to share in common. How can this be done?\nThrough historical and textual research, one can provide evidence that people from a given period could be plausibly expected to share certain cognitive assumptions. This “plausibility” is our plausibility: we frame our expectations in the light of historical research and we look for evidence to confirm or refute the hypothesis that we form about the cognitive assumptions of earlier generations. Subsequently, we can try and demonstrate that a macro-policy is a plausible conclusion from the set of cognitive assumptions that we expect the earlier generations to have. By deriving the macro-policy from these assumptions, we show that a collective agency acts in a reasonable way.\nAny such explanation is hypothetical: not only because this is how we make sense of macro-policies from the past, but also because we do not know how to develop causal explanations for human behavior as yet. However, this does not make the hypothesis arbitrary, because it is held in check by two other conceptual conditions: (a) there must be empirical evidence that enables us to hypothesize about a set of cognitive assumptions shared by the earlier generations; (b) dislodging the hypothesis requires another hypothesis, which does a better job at accounting for the relevant evidence.\nConsequently, the question that confronts us is this: why would it be reasonable to act as though a practice deserved toleration, if and only if it had scriptural sanctions? How does the cognitive framework of the colonial agents render such a stance reasonable for us?\nThe popular answer, which is the rival hypothesis that we want to challenge, suggests that the colonial state intended to appease the Indians by allowing them to practice their religious practices and that the British assumed that Hindu traditions were the analogues of Christianity[38]. Though valid to some extent, neither claim is satisfactory. Firstly, the colonial state should have allowed all practices held dearly by the population and not only those that were scripturally sanctioned, if its goal was to appease the native population. Secondly, this fails to tell us why the colonial state approached local traditions as structural equivalents of Christianity. The British were aware that these traditions were dissimilar from their own religion. Why did they nevertheless start looking for scriptural foundations and tolerate only practices that had such a sanction?\nWhen they landed in India, the British knew they would find “false religion.” This implied that the natives would be aware of the existence of the biblical God and would want to obey His law. However, the British also thought that the Devil and his minions would have deceived the believers into a false understanding of this law: evil priests would have imposed their own fabrications as though these were God’s will[39]. The Indians would be following these principles as sacred law. To understand Indian society, one had to identify those texts which the Hindus mistook for God’s revelation. One had to find their “ancient law giver”—the equivalent of Moses and Mohammed. This would become the key to decipher the Hindu religion and society[40].\nAt the same time, colonials were convinced that one ought not to interfere in Hindu practices sanctioned by this “sacred scripture.” The rationale suggested that religion was a domain where the biblical God alone had authority. No human being could impose his or her own understanding of God’s will on others. Therefore, the Hindus had to be left free to live according to the principles which they wrongly believed to be divine law. Hence, the implication wasreasonable to Protestant Christians and Deists: if a practice had its foundations in “Hindu sacred law,” no secular authority ought to interfere, because to do so would be to arrogate to civil powers that authority which God alone possessed.\nThe cognitive framework of the colonial state construed Hindu traditions as structural equivalents of Christianity in the sense that it viewed them as embodiments of a series of fundamental laws and doctrines, professing to be God’s revelation. The neutrality and toleration of the state depended on this equivalence. If Hinduism, Christianity and Islam embodied different religious doctrines and laws, then a liberal state simply ought to take a neutral position towards their conflicting truth claims and tolerate the practices that embodied these.\nHowever, in the case of traditions that do not look at ancestral practices as embodiments of doctrines, the resulting policy generated a mechanism that compelled these traditions to refashion themselves according to this model: the Indian subjects quickly learned that they needed to give evidence of scriptural foundations to continue practicing their traditions under colonial rule. This is how Hindu fundamentalism first manifested itself: as a child born from the liberal policies of the colonial state. The moment of transformation occurred because the colonial state operated within a theological framework that approached all traditions as variations on the biblical model of religion.\nIV\nThis transformation altered the pattern of dissent and agreement within the Hindu traditions. The impact of this second moment is perhaps clearest in the writings of Raja Rammohun Roy and his opponents. A rich Brahmin with a Persian and Arabic education, Roy is still glorified as the father of the modern Indian Renaissance[41]. In fact, we suggest that he took crucial conceptual steps towards the creation of Hindu fundamentalism. Wholeheartedly, he accepted the view that traditional practices ought to be founded on holy scriptures: “The validity of theological controversy, chiefly depends upon Scriptural authority.”[42]\nInfluenced by Islam and Christianity, Roy intended to revive the Hindu traditions by transforming them into a religion along the biblical model. In many of his texts, he spoke of the Vedas as though they were the Bible, of the Shastras as though they were church law, and of Manu as though he was Moses, the law giver of a people. He wanted to demonstrate that truth was to be found in Vedic religion, rather than in its rivals Islam or Christianity[43].\nConvinced that “the whole body of the Hindoo Theology, Law, and Literature is contained in the Vedas,” Roy denounced Hindu rituals as idolatrous fabrications and tried to convince his countrymen “of the true meaning of our sacred books.”[44] He did all this “for the purpose of diffusing Hindu scriptural knowledge among the adherents of that religion.”[45]\nThese scriptures, he thought, acknowledged that only the one true God ought to be worshipped, but self-interested Brahmin priests had led the believers into “the temple of idolatry” and into immorality[46]. Now, the aim was to reform Hindu practices according to scriptural sanctions.\nWhen the government decided to tolerate sati, Roy produced tract after tract arguing that it had no scriptural foundation, since neither the Vedas nor Manu recognized it[47]. This inspired some conservative Hindus of Calcutta to argue that he was wrong: scriptural foundations did exist for sati[48]. Thus, this reformer transmitted the religious model that sought to justify Hindu practices in terms of textual doctrines. While the liberal colonial state had initiated the genesis of Hindu fundamentalism among its pundits, a thinker like Roy disseminated it among the public.\nFrom this debate emerged a group that claimed to represent “the orthodox Hindu community of Calcutta.” In its petition against the abolition of sati, this group submitted that “the Hindoo religion is founded, like all religions, on usage as well as precept, and one when immemorial is held equally sacred with the other.” Therefore, “the sacrifice of self-immolation called suttee, which is not merely a sacred duty but a high privilege to her who sincerely believes in the doctrines of their religion,” ought not to be interfered with. The group combined the old attitude towards practices as age-old ancestral traditions with the tendency to provide them with doctrinal foundations[49].\nIn this way, the colonial toleration policy instigated a restructuring of Hindu traditions, which soon acquired an institutional shape. In 1830, the group appealed to “the orthodox Hindus” about the necessity of establishing a Dharma Sabha, which would “devise means for protecting our religion and our excellent customs and usages.”[50] This association met in the summer of 1830 to protest against the abolition of sati. Accordingly as Roy and his followers opposed its attempts, the Dharma Sabha was even more convinced that local traditions needed aggressive protection against “their opponents who wish the overthrow of religion.”[51]\nThis dynamic continued throughout the nineteenth century: the colonial intervention triggered the rise of Hindu reform movements. In their turn, these movements provoked traditional Hindus to organize themselves and defend a conservative interpretation of the “teachings of Hindu religion,” which sanctioned existing practices. The orthodox Hindu associations opposed the reform movement, but accepted its model of religion-as-doctrine.\nThis fueled the growing conviction in India that Hinduism, Islam and Christianity were rival religions with competing truth claims. Both reform movements and orthodox associations intended to defend Hinduism against the measures of the colonial state and the assaults of Christian missionaries. They were also hostile to Indian Muslims, who were seen as representatives of an aggressive religion and a colonial rule that had earlier attempted to destroy their traditions.\nThe chief agency of reform in this period was the Arya Samaj. In his autobiography, its founder Swami Dayanand Saraswati recounts how he came to the conviction that Hindu traditions were in need of reform. After an orthodox Sanskrit and ritual education, he had left home dissatisfied. After wandering through North India, he told of the “profound ignorance or ridiculous superstition” and temples “full of idols and priests” that he witnessed everywhere[52].\nThe movement established by Dayanand disseminated the colonial model of religion. A teacher had convinced him that religious truth was contained in the four Vedas and the Shastras. Earlier, these texts had been important only to limited strands within the Hindu traditions[53]. After the colonial state identified them as the Hindu scriptures and legal codes, however, reformers began to preach the same as gospel truth. Dayanand regarded them “as infallible and as authority by their very nature.” In fact, “they are self-authoritative and do not stand in need of any other book to uphold their authority.”[54] The Vedas and Shastras embodied religious truth. Like Roy, he insisted that the texts revealed a monotheistic Hinduism, similar and superior to Christianity and Islam.\nDayanand composed the foundational text of the Arya Samaj, the Sathyarth Prakash or Light of Truth (1875), which took a form analogous to Protestant catechisms. It claimed to contain the one correct interpretation of Vedas and Shastras, while all puranas and traditional Indian stories were denounced as “forged books.” The true confession of faith followed: “We believe that the Vedas alone are the supreme authority in the ascertainment of true religion—the true conduct of life. Whatever is enjoined by the Vedas we hold to be right; whilst whatever is condemned by them we believe to be wrong…All men, especially the Aryas, should believe in the Vedas and thereby cultivate unity in religion.”[55]\nThe Arya Samaj mimicked Protestant fundamentalism in yet other ways. As Roy had, so did Dayanand accept the characterization of Brahmins as selfish “popes,” who fabricated false teachings and kept true revelation from the laity. He imagined a history of religious degeneration, which mirrored the Protestant historiography of the Roman Catholic Church: “As in Europe, so in India the popery appeared in a thousand different forms, and cast its net of hypocrisy and fraud, in other words, the Indian popes have kept the rulers and the ruled from acquiring learning and associating with the good.”[56]\nThis reproduced the colonial version of Indian religious history. Like certain strands within the Reformation, this historiography invented a primitive and true Hindu religion, which had been corrupted by human additions over time. Now one had to return to the pure and primitive core: “I believe in a religion based on universal and all-embracing principles which have always been accepted as true by mankind, and will continue to command the allegiance of mankind in the ages to come. Hence it is that the religion in question is called the primeval eternal religion, which means that it is above the hostility of all human creeds whatsoever.”[57]\nThis restructuring of Hindu traditions introduced universal truth claims for a set of doctrines: “The educated Hindus have now learned that the religion of their forefathers is founded on solid rock of truth.”[58] It also entailed the launch of a missionary movement, which had been alien to Hindu traditions. As one of the Samaj publications put it, funds were required so “That our missionaries may be able to preach the Vedic religion even in the far distant nooks of the land and save the inhabitants thereof by taking them up, as it were, from the dark abyss of ignorance in which they are struggling.”[59] The newly converted threw their idols into the river or publicly smashed them in local markets.\nThus, this reform movement gradually spread elements of the colonial framework in Indian society. In his excellent work on the Arya Samaj in nineteenth-century Punjab, Kenneth Jones describes its impact on society. More and more, Christianity and Islam were viewed as rival religions, whose falsity had to be supplanted by Vedic truth. The Arya Samaj also attacked Sikhism as a degenerate rival. Consequently, several traditions in the urban Punjab of the 1880s entered into a strife over religious truth: “In the years that followed, the streets of Lahore became dotted with preachers—Christian, Arya, Brahmo, Sikh, Muslim— each extolling his particular cause and condemning all others.”[60]\nThe Arya Samaj also initiated stinging attacks on traditional pundits, who were chided for hardly knowing Sanskrit and the Vedas. Rather than realizing that these texts were marginal to many Hindu traditions, this ignorance was viewed as another confirmation of the corruption of popular religion in India. Hence, the Arya Samaj began to reform all traditions “in strict accordance to Vedic principles.”[61]\nSuch moves also gave rise to opposition from traditional Hindus, but again the latter adopted the new framework. They invoked scriptural foundations to claim the opposite of Arya Samaj doctrines. One of the first to do so was Pandit Din Dayal, who in a lecture “is said to have proved by quotations from the Vedas, Puranas and the Smritis, that the worship of idols alone is the means of finding God.”[62] By the mid 1890s, traditional Hindus united in Sanatan Dharma Sabhas in order to propound the “eternal religion.” In their meetings also, “the correct meaning” of the Vedas was presented as “the basic scripture” of this religion. Here, the tenets of “unity in diversity” and “the Truth is only One,” but “different persons call it by different names” were formulated as Hindu religious teachings. Along with this message of Hindu tolerance, there was an emphasis on the national pride and unity of Aryan Hindus—a combination that remains popular among advocates of Hindutva today[63].\nSimilar reform movements, such as the Prarthana Samaj in Bombay, were started in other parts of the subcontinent, with analogous social effects. From this moment of dissemination grew a generation of intellectuals and politicians in India. Mahadev G. Ranade, Lala Lajpat Rai, Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Bipin Chandra Pal and many others had all been involved in, or opposed to, these movements at some point. All of them would play significant roles in the development of Hindu nationalism[64].\nV\nWe shall now jump to the twentieth century, since the next two moments are conceptual rather than historical in nature. The first is the moment of distortion. On the one hand, Hindu nationalists adopted the liberal framework and language of the colonial state, but distorted its meaning. On the other, the appropriation of this framework began to distort the experience and self-understanding of the Indian traditions.\nAs we have seen, the principle of toleration initiated this distortion by making Hindus defend their traditional practices as sacred doctrines. Along with toleration and neutrality, the right to religious freedom was a basic tenet of British colonialism: “The Government of India, as between its subjects and itself, does not assume the truth or falsehood of any religion. It allows perfect freedom and liberty to the professors of all creeds.”[65]\nTo understand the impact of this principle, we need to turn to the theological framework that informed modern notions of religious liberty. In Christianity, religion was regarded as the domain of the biblical God’s law. Consequently, it became a sacrosanct realm of divine truth. As long as basic justice was respected, secular political powers could not interfere in this realm. If believers considered some practice as a part of this domain, then the belief was that the state generally ought not to meddle. To do so would be equivalent to trying to subordinate divine authority to human powers. Throughout the nineteenth century, the right to religious freedom was invoked in Europe and America by various confessions in order to safeguard certain beliefs and practices as a part of this inviolable realm.\nIn India, on the contrary, it had typically been the case that political authorities managed many traditional practices in financial and other ways[66]. They were expected to do so. Hence, in its early phase, the British colonial government took part in temple management, imposed pilgrim taxes and involved itself in festivals and ceremonies[67]. Given this custom of government regulation of traditional practices, “freedom of religion” could never be absolute here.\nThese colonial policies were soon disapproved of. Dispatches were sent from London to Bengal “relating to the Withdrawal of Interference with the Religious Ceremonies of the Natives of India.” The management of all temples and religious activities had to be “resigned into the hands of the natives.”[68] Such measures were in part inspired by the “revolting” image of a Christian state providing patronage to idolatry. But the principle of religious freedom also played a crucial role. As a dispatch stated, “you will make such arrangements as may appear to you to be necessary for relieving all our servants, whether Christians, Mahomedans, or Hindoos, from the compulsory performance of any acts which you may consider to be justly liable to objections on the ground of religious scruples.”[69] After the 1857 rebellion, supposedly provoked by the infringement of Hindu and Muslim sensitivities[70], the British government became extremely cautious about violating the religious freedom of its subjects.\nIndians soon showed great prowess at invoking this notion of religious liberty. In the 1830s, the group that claimed to represent “the orthodox Hindu community of Calcutta” had already argued that the abolition of sati was “an unjust and intolerant dictation in matters of conscience.”[71] Later in the nineteenth century, B.G. Tilak and others appealed to “the liberties of the people” in the anti-cow-killing movement and in controversies about Hindu processions[72]. In the twentieth century, this tendency reached new heights when Hindu nationalists lamented that “Hindu rights” were violated in order to placate the Muslims[73].\nThis appropriation distortedthe concept of religious freedom. In Europe, it had referred to the right of each citizen to profess and practice any religious belief, without interference from the state. As an individual right, it was called upon to protect dissenters from church orthodoxy. Hindu nationalists, however, adopted the principle of religious liberty in terms of their notion of a sacred core of Hindu-ness. Thus, the “Hindu nation” became the bearer of rights here. “Religious freedom” became a means to convince the followers of indigenous Indian traditions that they were one Hindu community with common interests expressed in their inviolable “rights.”\nThe rights language was typically invoked in inflammatory sites of conflict such as the problem of Hindu ritual processions passing nearby mosques. Muslims often reacted aggressively in such cases, because music and conch blowing in the processions disturbed the mandatory silence around mosques. Local authorities regularly interfered in the processions to prevent conflicts. Yet, in the first half of the twentieth century, Hindu nationalists began to insist on their sacred right to decide the procession routes. In 1941, Savarkar congratulated the Hindus of Nellore “on the boldness in asserting their civic and religious rights” when they refused to give in to the governmental ban on a ritual procession. Later, he sent a telegram to support them in their suffering for “the cause of civic and religious liberty.”[74]\nIn his speeches of the same period, Savarkar rebuked the “policy of forcing the Hindus to forgo their legitimate and peaceful religious, civic and political rights to placate fanatical Moslem goondaism.”[75] The rights concept proved ever more popular, when one could convince Hindus that their “rights” were being trampled upon. When the government refused to allow a Hindu Mahasabha meeting that was to take place on Bakr’ Id, an important Muslim holiday, Savarkar spoke of “the furious struggle raging…to assert the legitimate rights of Hindudom.” He stressed “the fact that the struggle was fought out in defence of Hindu Rights as Hindu Rights and under the unalloyed Hindu Colours.”[76]\nAccording to contemporary observers like Lala Lajpat Rai, the introduction by the British colonials of the principle of religious liberty was responsible for growing conflict. It would be foolish, he wrote, to assert the right of a Hindu to take his procession along mosques in a Muslim dominated village or to insist on the Muslim’s right of sacrificing cows in a place like Mathura.\nUnhappily the British rule has encouraged both Hindus and Muhammadans to assert such rights and to fight if they are denied. The philosophy of individualism and the idea of absolute religious freedom,…which in India are at the present time directly traceable to British rule, have taken such a firm root in the minds of Indians that they are playing havoc in all phases of our national life…The sum total of my reasoning is this, that one of the causes of the present tension between Hindus and Muhammadans has been the unfortunate revival of the idea of absolute freedom in the matter of religious observances.[77]\nThis assessment reflected the old belief that political authority should interfere in traditional practices where necessary. However, the rights language and the principle of religious freedom of the colonial state inspired each Indian community to regard traditional practices as an untouchable sacrosanct sphere. Thus, they modeled the self-understanding of their traditions upon the notion of religion as the realm of God’s law.\nThis suited the program of Hindu fundamentalism, which was fed by colonial liberalism in yet another way. Its proponents began to defend religious liberty as a right to engage in traditional practices, even where this provoked violence. This firebrand advocacy of religious freedom intensified Hindu-Muslim conflicts, rather than preventing them. It became worse when the principle began to refer to “Hindu rights” as the supposed interests of a community. The colonial legal system inspired, if not compelled, its subjects to adopt its language. In the process, Hindu fundamentalism distorted the concepts to fit in with the sensitivities it intended to cultivate among the population.\nVI\nNeutrality, toleration and religious liberty were seen as the norms that ought to direct state policies regarding the religious realm. They constituted the normative framework of the colonial state which shaped its perception of Indian society. From this perspective, each factual situation was understood as a deficiency vis-à-vis the liberal framework and its principles. This is the moment of normative disjunction, which reduced the options open to the Indian state and society: either liberal secularism or its normative negation, religious fundamentalism.\nWhen the British arrived in India, as we have said earlier, many “knew” in advance what the basic structure of her native traditions would be. As instances of false religion, these would consist of priestly hierarchies and fabricated laws, which led the believers into idolatry[78]. This view was structured by a generic Protestant framework, which had spiritual liberty as its normative focus and construed its rivals as religious tyrannies, the equivalents of the “popish hierarchy.” From the seventeenth century onwards, the descriptions were unequivocal: Indian religion had taken the form of a tyranny of priests, who were incidentally called “Brahmins” here. Like their Catholic counterparts, the Hindu priests had kept “the religious books” and “the sacred language” to themselves so as to protect their worldly interests[79].\nA key mechanism is at work here. Generally, from the perspective of a normative framework, factual situations are experienced as, or transformed into, deficiencies vis-à-vis the framework. The conceptual framework of the British helped them construe Indian traditions as negations of their own norms. Whereas this framework revolved around principles of religious liberty and equality, the native religions of India could only embody their opposites. In the colonial eyes, Hinduism and “Brahmanism” became the quintessence of religious tyranny[80]. As opposed to their own norms, British scholars and officials perceived religious fanaticism and theocratic despotism throughout Indian history and society[81].\nIn his textbook history of India, Talboys Wheeler contrasted the “Hindu despotisms” of the seventeenth century to the “British liberties” brought by colonial rule[82]. According to Valentine Chirol in his classic Indian Unrest (1910), the trouble in India was Brahmanism, which “as a system represents the antipodes of all that British rule must stand for in India, and Brahmanism has from times immemorial dominated Hindu society— dominated it, according to the Hindu Nationalists, for its salvation.” This included “a theocratic State,” where “both spiritual and secular authority were consecrated in the hands of the Brahmans.” Indian unrest in general had as “its mainspring…a deep-rooted antagonism to all the principles upon which Western society, especially in a democratic country like England, has been built up.”[83] Or as Sir Alfred Lyall said in his introduction to the same work, while the British were “relying upon secular education and absolute religious neutrality to control the unruly affections of sinful men,” Indian agitators combined “primitive superstition” with modern politics: “The mixture of religion with politics has always produced a highly explosive compound, especially in Asia.”[84]\nThis was not an “othering of the other” or not even primarily a justification of colonial rule, as contemporary critics of Orientalism might suggest[85]. Rather, it was an epistemic consequence of the normative framework that constrained the colonial reasoning on religion, state and society. This carved up the universe of political possibilities in terms of a normative disjunction: either one pursued a liberal secular state or one ended up in religious oppression.\nThe colonial project presupposed that western civilization embodied the pursuit of the norms of liberty, equality and toleration. Propelled by this normative goal, the progressive West viewed itself as far superior to the “unchanged and stationary” Asia, stuck in despotism and theocracy[86]. In short: “To India British rule has brought security, justice, religious freedom, and the repression of all religious conflicts, together with a vast material progress made possible by the substitution of law and order for the medieval anarchy that preceded it.”[87]\nIn other words, the British believed they had demonstrated that the immoral structure of Indian society had to be replaced by their own moral laws. In reality, they were begging the question. First, they presupposed the validity of the liberal framework. Next, they viewed and described Indian society through this framework and transformed it into a deficiency vis-à- vis its norms. From this, they concluded liberalism had to be implemented here as elsewhere. The framework through which they viewed India had the same belief as its presupposition and as its conclusion: Indian society embodied the failure to live up to the norms of western civilization.\nThe western-educated Indian intelligentsia of colonial India adopted this mode of reasoning. Hence, while the freedom fighters desired to end colonial rule, it had become self- evident to many that a free India would also have to create a secular liberal state, or it would end up in religious despotism. This normative disjunction was perhaps clearest in the mind of Jawaharlal Nehru, India’s first Prime Minister after Independence. His perspective allowed for two potential forms of political organization only: either a secular state or a religious theocracy. As he wrote in a letter to a Muslim aristocrat: “If Pakistan insists on being what is called an Islamic State it will be backward, narrow-minded and unprogressive just as India, if its seeks to be a Hindu State, would be similarly backward and unprogressive.”[88]\nThroughout his writings, this conceptual restriction on Nehru’s thought is striking: either a country is a progressive civilized secular nation-state or it becomes a backward narrow-minded theocracy. In a 1947 speech, he asserted: “As long as I am at the helm of affairs India will not become a Hindu State…The very idea of a theocratic state is not only medieval but also stupid. In modern times the people may have their religion but not the State.”[89] This two-pronged view compelled him to conceive of violence in the Indian society as religious fundamentalism or “communalism.” Just as all peaceful pluralism was equivalent to the separation of politics and religion in Nehru’s mind, the violence between different communities was the consequence of mixing the political and the religious.\nAs the title of another speech said, the alternatives were either “Toleration or Ruin”: “Toleration alone will lead India to peace and prosperity. I warn you that the manner in which this killing is going on will lead the country to nothing but ruin.”[90] Were one to define “toleration” as “the absence of violent conflict,” such an approach would amount to a truism. But Nehru did not have this tautology in mind. Toleration meant “a democratic secular State which neither favours nor discriminates against any particular religion” and this was the only conceivable aim for a civilized country[91].\nThe Nehruvian secularism of post-Independence India reproduced the normative disjunction introduced by the colonial state. Civilization was equated to “the liberal secular state.” All opposition was conceived as “religious fundamentalism.” This framework allowed for only one form of opposition, namely, the normative negation of itself: the pursuit of a Hindu nation-state founded in principles of Hindutva. The clash between liberal secularism and Hindu fundamentalism in India, then, is a grand colonial struggle. It is a confrontation between a normative framework and the mirror image it has produced.\nVII\nIn conclusion, we can return to our original questions: What explains the Hindutva movement’s quixotic pursuit of a set of beliefs common to all Hindus, upon which it desires to found Indian society? Why do modern Hindus perceive Islam and Christianity as rival religions, incompatible with Hindu doctrines, when this experience was more or less absent before the eighteenth century?\nHindu fundamentalism emerged from the intervention of the liberal colonial state.This state operated within a particular theological framework, which construed the indigenous traditions of India as variants of the same phenomenon as Islam and Christianity. Colonial policies of toleration and neutrality induced the Hindu traditions to transform themselves according to this model. They were induced to identify scriptural foundations for their practices, in order to survive under the rule of the Raj.\nThis inspired a series of movements in nineteenth-century India to embark on a quest for “the true teachings and principles of Hindu religion.” Originally, they turned to the Vedas and Shastras. Given the lack of consensus and the diversity of traditions, however, the core of Hindu principles could not but become less precise. No set of scriptures or specificdogmas would be accepted by all Hindu traditions. Eventually, the Hindutvamovement located its unity in notions of “Hindu tolerance.”\nIn other words, Hindu nationalists are not “decolonizing the Hindu mind,”[92] but rather sustain and reproduce the colonial transformation of Indian traditions. As the colonial model of religion locates Hindu identity in a shared set of principles and beliefs, Islam and Christianity are now inevitably viewed as rivals with incompatible doctrines. Accordingly as Hindutva focused on principles of tolerance, Islamic and Christian intolerance towards other religions were identified as the central flaws of these minorities. From this perspective, in order to coexist with the Hindu nation, Indian Islam and Christianity have to conform themselves to its fundamental principles.\nIn this sense, liberal secularism and religious fundamentalism in India are two faces of the same coin. They are two mutually reinforcing moments of a mechanism that transforms the native traditions of India into variants of the religions of the Book. If the two forces are not opposites in this one case, then we will have to rethink their mutual relationship in general. More importantly, it is high time for the intellectuals to move beyond the normative disjunction between liberal secularism and religious fundamentalism. There have been calls to draw on the Indian traditions as alternative sources of vibrant pluralism, which may improve upon the dominant liberal model[93]. Instead of dismissing such attempts as revivalism or indigenism, we might consider the possibility that liberal secularism is not the one true political salvation for humanity.\nReferences: 1 See the five volumes resulting from the Fundamentalism project coordinated and edited by Martin E.

A fieldwork project by Kuvempu University in Karnataka, South India shows that most “Hindus” have never heard of the Vedas or the Shastras, let alone know their content.

E.g., Walter Ewer stated in 1818 that “it is well known that not one man in a thousand knows anything of the contents of the Shasters…,” in BPP 1821, Vol. 18, 229. Or: “If a religion be a creed with certain distinctive tenets, the Hinduism of the mass of people is not a religion at all. Their religion is in no way represented by the sacred books of Sanskrit literature. The sanctity of the Vedas is an accepted article of faith among Hindus who have heard of their existence, but they have nothing to do with the existing popular beliefs. The Puranas, and other comparatively late works, which Elphinstone says may be called the scriptures of modern Hinduism, have no practical connection with the religion of the great majority of the population.” Sir John Strachey, India: Its Administration \u0026amp; Progress (London, 1911), 317.\n54 Dayanand Saraswati, Autobiography, 82-83.\n55 Swami Dayanand Saraswati, Light of Truth or an English Translation of the Satyarth Prakash, trans.

This is no different in India. In the 2015 report released about a fortnight ago, the country again occupies an unenviable spot in Tier 2, which includes countries where the religious freedom violations engaged in or tolerated by the government are serious.\nStriking about this year’s report, however, is its claim that incidents of religiously-motivated and communal violence have ‘reportedly’ increased for three consecutive years in India. “According to Muslim and Christian NGOs that track communal incidents,” it adds, “2014 statistics, yet to be released by the ministry, will be likely higher” than the 823 incidents recorded in 2013.\nHow reliable then are the international religious freedom reports of the US government? The obvious retort to this question is that the home ministry’s data for 2014 must be very biased. But which other unbiased data could establish this bias? When asked this question, an American academic responded as follows: “I don’t have any data, but given who is in charge, it can’t help but be biased.” That, of course, is a knockdown argument.What is so remarkable about this? Well, the Indian home ministry’s official data about communal incidents for 2014 give a very different picture. The number of incidents saw a significant decrease to 644 in 2014. The USCIRF report also includes Andhra Pradesh, “Chattisgarhi” , and Odisha among states that “tend to have the greatest number of religiously-motivated attacks and communal violence incidents.” Yet the home ministry’s information recorded no incident in Chhattisgarh, just three in Odisha, and five in Andhra Pradesh.\nOther academics point out that many incidents of communal violence remain unreported in India. But surely this is not the issue at stake. The real question is about the number of communal incidents in 2014 relative to the number of such incidents in the two preceding years. The data provided by the home ministry show that this number is lower. Now, are there facts (or well-founded reasons) that prove that in 2014 suddenly a much higher number of communal incidents were not reported than in previous years? If this is not the case, then we can only assume that the average number of unreported incidents has not changed significantly. And if that is the case, then the claims of the USCIRF must be false.\nWhat evidence did the American commission draw upon to come to its conclusions? Its website claims the following: “USCIRF obtains information about violations of religious freedom abroad in multiple ways, including visiting selected countries in order to observe facts on the ground, meeting regularly with foreign officials, religious leaders and groups, victims of religious intolerance, and representatives of civil society, non-governmental organisations, government agencies, and national and international organisations, and keeping abreast of credible news reports.”\nIndeed, the 2015 report shows the results of this type of deep research. It mentions conversations with minority religious leaders and NGO representatives. Its repetitive use of the words ‘reportedly’ and ‘report’ is striking: “Incidents of religiously-motivated and communal violence reportedly have increased”; “Christian NGOs and leaders report that their community is particularly at risk…”; “… Muslim communities have reported facing undue scrutiny and arbitrary arrests and detentions”; Indian Christians, converts and missionaries “have reported more frequent harassment and violence …”.\nThe evidence then seems to amount to impressions of particular people, hearsay, anecdotes and newspaper articles. Clearly, it gives a privileged status to the observations of certain NGOs, religious leaders, and the dominant media, which can hardly count as reliable and ‘unbiased’ sources in these matters. Moreover, the report depends on dubious concepts such as ‘religiously-motivated violence’, but forgets to mention what criteria it used to find out whether violent incidents are ‘religiously-motivated’ or otherwise.\nNaturally, the fact that some religious groups feel threatened in their basic freedoms is important. Some Hindu nationalist organisations do commit unacceptable acts of violence against Christians and Muslims. Such crimes need to be addressed by the government. Some Hindutva supporters are also becoming increasingly aggressive online and elsewhere. This problem has to be examined and tackled. But can all of this serve as evidence for grand claims about the disquieting rise of religious freedom violations in India? Does it suffice to make recommendations to the US government about Tier 2 ‘watch lists’ and the like? No, it does not. It appears that forces other than evidence give shape to the claims of the American campaign for international religious freedom.\nHypocrisy: Which forces might those be? One obvious route is to note the hypocrisy and ‘holier than thou’ stance behind the US international human rights violation reports. This government would never dream of putting its own country on its watch lists, even though there are good reasons to do so. For instance, to identify “countries of particular concern,” the USCIRF uses the standard of the International Religious Freedom Act (IRFA), which defines “particularly severe” violations of religious freedom as “systematic, ongoing, egregious violations of religious freedom, including violations such as—(a) torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment; (b) prolonged detention without charges; (c) causing the disappearance of persons by the abduction or clandestine detention of those persons; or (d) other flagrant denial of the right to life, liberty, or the security of persons.\u0026quot;\nThis reads like a laundry list of the American government’s war on terror.\nHowever, simply noting that the US violates its own standards (as the Chinese government does in its own annual human rights violations reports) can neither explain nor legitimise anything much. It does not account for the many American policies that do reflect a genuine concern about the state of religious freedom at home and abroad. Still, the sense that the annual report reeks of the disingenuous has legitimate grounds. In fact, a more fundamental hypocrisy is at work. Let me explain how.\nBoth the conceptual language and the style of collecting evidence of the USCIRF go way back to the foundations of religious freedom in theology. The notion of Christian freedom is perhaps the core theological value of Protestant Christianity. Basically, it says the following: no human being has authority in the religious sphere, for only the biblical God can rule there. Therefore, the state cannot interfere in matters of religion. Each conscience – the faculty that conveys to humanity the will of its Sovereign Creator – should always be free, for no man possesses the knowledge required to decide when another’s conscience truly discloses God’s will or when it succumbs to Satan’s seductive whispers.\nThe USCIRF’s annual reports reflect these deep-seated religious concerns of Protestant Christianity. Take its vehement rejection of anti-conversion legislation in India as a violation of religious freedom. This derives from the Christian belief that every individual should be free to turn towards the true God at all times and that this can be done only by converting from false to true religion. For the US commission, this freedom to follow one’s own conscience always overrides other concerns – say, for instance, the worry often voiced in India that Christian missionary activity constitutes aggression upon the traditions, sensitivities, and harmony of a community.\nWhy? Well, protecting individual religious freedom has to do with safeguarding the right of every person to follow the will of the true God, which supersedes any issue that is merely human, such as the peace or stability of some social group. Hence, the fact that missionary work involves abusing the Hindu traditions as ‘false religion’ or theirdevas and devis as ‘false gods’ is considered much less problematic than putting restrictions on conversion. The fact that converts often insult the traditions to which they previously belonged is irrelevant when compared to the individual’s freedom of religion. The fact that family and community life are severely disrupted because of proselytisation is a trivial detail in the face of the eternal human choice between true and false religion, between God and the devil.\nThis is not the only religious dimension of the 2015 report. In spite of apparent evidence to the contrary, it suggests that the dominance of the BJP (as a Hindu nationalist party) in the Indian government must inevitably give rise to an upsurge of religious and communal violence. In other words, the entry of Hinduism into politics constitutes a major threat to religious freedom. Again, this conviction is rooted in the religion that gave shape to American culture.\nAccording to Protestantism, heathen religions like that of India always tyrannise the human spirit. Inspired by the devil, they are characterised by their violation of Christian religious freedom. Therefore, the story continues, ‘Hinduism’ aims to stifle the soul and subordinate the conscience to human authority (through its caste system, for instance). Stripped of their overtly theological elements, such beliefs entered American common sense and popular discourse about India and her traditions. This story about ‘Hinduism’ makes it all the more obvious to the Americans (and to others who accept this story, such as the Indian secularists) that the freedom to escape from this religion should be safeguarded at all cost. Little wonder then that factual evidence is of secondary concern to the USCIRF. The background framework within which it works is a scarcely secularised Protestant religious doctrine. According to the self-understanding of this doctrine, it derives from the Bible, the one true Word of the one true God. When 19th-century Protestants travelled to India, they did not need factual evidence to know that false religion would rule the roost and deny religious freedom to its followers. God had disclosed this. The US commission claims no such divinely inspired foreknowledge. Still, it also knows in advance what it should and will find in Indian society. Thus, it has no problem privileging the claims of Christian leaders and NGOs, other minority spokesmen, and mainstream newspapers – ignoring the perspectives of a plethora of other groups, thinkers and the media. And, oh yes, any evidence to the contrary must be the result of human tampering, such as the home ministry’s bias and Hindu nationalist cover-ups.\nReligious nationalism: Here lies the hypocrisy: the US campaign for international religious freedom is very much a religious campaign. It seeks to spread Protestant-Christian values across the world but does so under the guise of promoting and protecting human rights that are ‘universally held sacred’. This claim to a sacred yet secular universality also underlies its condemnation of religious nationalism as a threat to the freedom of India’s citizens. Nonetheless, the American nation-state’s mission to bring freedom to all the world’s nations is propelled by the belief in the Protestant doctrine of Christian freedom. This in turn is founded in a series of convictions: God is the author of freedom; the Bible is the revelation of His will; and Reformation theology is its correct interpretation. How, then, could this mission not be an instance of religious nationalism?\nIf the US would straight out admit that it is a Christian nation and, therefore, seeks to promote Christian freedom across the globe, this dimension of its foreign policy would appear coherent and credible (and even commendable, in the eyes of some). It would be part of a larger project of saving souls, guided by a religion that believes itself to be true. From this perspective, factual evidence would not be needed, for no human considerations could trump God’s truth. However, the campaign for international religious freedom will remain sanctimonious so long as it pretends to a bogus ‘impartial’ position. To regain its credibility and honesty, the US should simply rename its commission as the Mission for International Christian Freedom and go on spreading the good word.\n","tags":[],"title":"US Commission for International Christian Freedom","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/us-commission-for-international-religious-freedom/"},{"categories":["Jakob","published","niticentral"],"content":"Rape of a Country\nJakob De Roover\nImagine. A filmmaker travels to Belgium because she has heard about the pedophilia scandals in the country. She directs a documentary film including an interview with an infamous pedophile, who says that the girls he raped had actually seduced him and that they really enjoyed it. The filmmaker then comments that Belgian society is responsible for creating such pedophiles by teaching them what to think. Most men in this country are programmed in this way, she insists. In fact, this is all part of a larger disease and culture, which is also reflected in Belgian cinema. How would we Belgians react? We would find this shocking and infuriating. It is as though pedophilia is an expression of the core of our culture, as though we are programmed for child abuse.\nThis is not an imaginary story, even though it does concern another country. Over the past days, the international hue and cry about rape in India went through another round. This time the cause is a documentary where one of the accused in a brutal rape case makes atrocious statements. Significantly, the filmmaker does not see him as a pathological man. In an interview, she characterizes him as representative of “most men in this country,” who are “programmed in a certain way.” It is this society that creates and encourages such rapists, she says, and the objectifying of women in Bollywood films shows how this is part of a larger disease and culture.\nMany Indians reacted with shock. Many are also infuriated. Some even see this as an international conspiracy to defame India. And then came the call for blocking the film. It is easy to dismiss all of this as misguided expressions of a hurt national pride unable to cope with the reality of rape and misogyny in India. Or to ridicule this as cultural paranoia. But the many Indians who feel this way are neither paranoid nor stupid. In fact, we need to make sense of the widespread impression that such an international conspiracy is going on.\nTo understand what is at stake, let us turn back to the heart of Europe. Here, the media agrees with the filmmaker. One headline says “A girl should just let herself be raped quietly” – insinuating that this is a widespread opinion in India. The journalist writes: “Especially in North India women are considered outlaws when it comes to sex.” In other words, any man can have a go at them without threat of punishment. But how could Indian men in general – who are also fathers, brothers and sons of women – see these women as objects freely available for rape? This can be the case only if the culture is itself morally perverse: mothers and fathers must raise their sons to become rapists. This is the implicit message of the discourse about rape in India.\nIndia used to be the land of gurus, snake charmers and fakirs. It was the country of caste, cows and curry. Nowadays, it has become the nation of rape in the Western imagination. Time and again, women travelling to India are warned: “Be careful with all those rapists there.” People from all walks of life keep expressing their disgust at a culture where rape seems to be part of everyday life. The media join in: “How India became a country of gang rapes.” “The terrible truth about rape in India.” “In rural India, rapes are common, but justice for victims is not.” “Why rapes are ‘normal’ in India.” These are only a few representative headlines. What is so striking about these claims is the following: they transform the immoral acts of certain individuals into expressions of an entire culture and its values.\nWhat are the factual grounds for this move? In Belgium, four to five gang rapes take place every week. Eight women are raped every single day. In a study of the EU’s Agency for Fundamental Rights one third of all European women reveal that they have been the victims of physical and sexual violence. As many report that they went through such violence at the hands of adults during their youth. 55% of all women has experienced sexual intimidation. But how many newspaper stories do we see about “how Belgium became a country of gang rapes”? How many journalists try to explain “why sexual violence is ‘normal’ in Europe” or “how women in the EU are outlawed when it comes to sex”? Right. None.\n“Three women raped per hour in India,” the European press cried out recently. But they forget to mention that this is out of a population of 1.25 billion. In Belgium, one rape is reported every three hours – out of a population of 11 million. In England and Wales alone, where the population is less than 56 million, about 78,000 rapes are estimated to occur every year. That amounts to more than 9 rapes every hour. You can do the math yourself. Or you could leave that to a 2010 United Nations report. In India, 1.8 rapes per 100,000 inhabitants were reported that year. In Belgium, the number was almost 30. It was 27.3 for the US and about 28 for the UK.\nThe predictable response is that only a fraction of rapes is reported in India. Well, in countries like Belgium, experts estimate that only 1 in 10 cases of sexual violence is reported by the victims. Even if the number in India is only 1 in 100, there are still many more cases of sexual violence in Belgium, the US or the UK. One could add that the Indian police is notoriously corrupt in its condoning of rape and that even these projections underestimate the real number. But this only shows that one can deny any empirical data in order to embrace the image of India as a rape nation.\nThe reporting about India excels in ignorance. It blindly buys into the stories told by a particular class of journalists and intellectuals, who are expert at confirming the Western views about India. Thus, when two girls were found hanging from a tree in an Indian village in May 2014, the European media jumped on this. Obviously, these girls had been raped and murdered because of caste, the evil social system of India. “You can rape and kill a Dalit girl,” said one headline. Another article reported that these girls were from “the Dalit community, a group of people at the bottom of the social ladder who were excluded from the caste system.” The higher castes, both journalists revealed with much fanfare, use sexual violence to oppress the lower castes.\nWhen the facts emerged, these same media kept quiet. Clearly, they had no clue that there is no such thing as “the Dalit community.” They also had no evidence whatsoever for the claim that men from ‘higher castes’ systematically rape women from ‘lower castes’, because there is no such evidence to be found. Of course, they could not admit that the alleged perpetrators did not belong to a higher caste and the girls were not untouchables, but that both belonged to OBC groups. It would be even more painful to recognize that the CBI came to the conclusion that there was no evidence of rape or murder, that one of the girls had been having an affair with the main accused, and that the family members had made inconsistent statements and appeared to have bribed the witnesses. Instead they insinuated that the police was trying to cover up the crimes. This fit beautifully into the common story about India; the facts did not.\nIn Europe (and among certain intellectuals in India) clichés about India replace all reasonable reflection. Hatred towards women is deeply rooted in this society, journalists say. Evidently, the implicit comparison is always with European society and its emancipation of women. Well, let us compare the role of women in the political landscape of India with that of a country like Belgium. The last ten years, arguably the most powerful person in India was a woman. Similarly, several women could be found among the most popular and powerful leaders of state-level governments. The same goes for mayors and university vice-chancellors. India had its first female prime minister in 1966. Fifty years later, we are still waiting. As of yet, no woman has become prime minister of the federal government of Belgium. As of yet, no woman has become minister-president of the regional government of Flanders. As of yet, my city has seen no woman as its mayor. Oh, but yes, recently my university did appoint its first female rector in almost 200 years.\nIt is not that all of the European reporting about India is fictitious. The country has its share of problems when it comes to the relationship between men and women. Only a fool would deny that. There is tremendous injustice towards women, as is the case elsewhere. In cities like Delhi, sexual violence and harassment are a major concern. The hobnobbing between politicians and goondas in certain parts of India rightly shocks observers. But our dominant stories do not allow us to understand any of these dimensions of Indian society. They only create delusions about the country.\nIndeed, in a population of 1.25 billion, one will find more psychopaths and pathological individuals than in a population of 11 million. But to infer from this that most Indian men are programmed to think of women as objects of rape is an instance of the fallacy of hasty generalization. “Not all Indian men think and act in this way,” commentators often admit. But this just confirms how twisted and offensive this approach is. Pathological men are now presented as the norm of Indian society and ethical men as the exception, while it is surely the other way round.\nTo show how defective this discourse is, we can just select another set of facts, which allow us to draw opposite conclusions. The numerous female politicians, the devis that are commonly revered, gurus like Amma who are followed by so many, the importance of the mother in Indian society. All of these facts could be used to suggest that women occupy an extraordinary position in Indian culture. Without serious research, such a conclusion would be as empty as the stories about “the deeply rooted hatred of women.” But this exercise reveals just how irrational the discourse about rape culture in India is.\nThe fallacy of hasty generalization is commonly used in propaganda and the politics of fear (remember Goebbels). Now, it is part and parcel of the discourse about rape in India. No wonder then that many Indians have the sense of an international conspiracy against their country. However misguided the calls for banning films and books may be, they are expressions of a feeling of powerlessness in the face of a centuries-old discourse about Indian culture that continues to dominate international public opinion. In insidious ways, this discourse represents India as the very embodiment of immorality: a culture that programs its people to follow immoral rules as though these are moral.\nAs Europeans, we could empathize with the people of an emerging country facing all the problems of a culture injured by centuries of colonialism and a society disrupted by an era of poverty. We could together look for solutions to the problems that we share. Instead, we reproduce old colonial stories about India as an immoral culture. This gives us a twisted relationship to the Indian people. On the one hand, we keep turning towards the same class of Indian journalists, activists, and intellectuals for ‘local knowledge’. But these native informants merely talk the talk of the West to the West. On the other hand, more and more Indians are disgusted by Europe’s condescending attitude towards their country. And this we dismiss as hurt national pride. If we want to bring our two peoples and cultures closer together in this new age, reason and empathy are our only hope. The madness of the current discourse about India must end.\nComments Manish Sharma — 2015-05-16 11:21:09\nA very nice attempt. Sad to hear this type of news. Dont know if BBC is conspiring to defame India or not but certainly this is not good journalism.

By the time we reach chapter 7, and start thinking in terms of \u0026lsquo;secularization’, I will be talking about secularizing religious themes with respect to the same.\nNeither the words ‘concrete’ or ‘abstract’, nor the concepts associated with them are \u0026lsquo;religious’. (In this sense, concepts are neither \u0026lsquo;religious’ nor \u0026lsquo;scientific’.) The same applies to the use of words ‘concrete thought’ and \u0026lsquo;abstract thought’ (or to their meaning). But what is religious is the above idea, which speaks of different stages of human cognitive growth in terms of \u0026lsquo;concrete’ and ‘abstract thought’.\nWhat makes them religious is that they are a part of a network of theological thinking about human beings, and their thinking. The origin of religion (as modern day pseudo-scientific theories would have it) is traced to the \u0026lsquo;concrete’ thinking that the savages and the primitives employ contrasted to which stands the \u0026lsquo;abstract’ thinking about God that characterizes the Semitic religions (mostly Christianity). We will get acquainted with some of them in chapter 5.\nPiaget, Vygotsky (his pupil Luria, more importantly), and many anthropologists borrow this idea about human thinking from theology, I claim. (Irrespective of whether they know this, or not.) Philosophically and logically speaking, every idea is just as \u0026lsquo;abstract’ as you want or as \u0026lsquo;concrete’ as you like. This distinction can be a relative distinction within a particular context, but it makes no sense to use this distinction as a distinctive trait of human thinking in either some form or at some stage.\nPlato’s \u0026lsquo;forms’ has nothing \u0026lsquo;abstract’ about it, any more than an object has something \u0026lsquo;concrete’ about it. Is a \u0026lsquo;quark’ more concrete than an \u0026lsquo;atom’, which, in its turn, is supposed to be less \u0026lsquo;abstract’ than a table, which is supposed to be more concrete than the color ‘green’. There is a tradition in philosophy which uses \u0026lsquo;form’ and \u0026lsquo;object’ in terms of \u0026lsquo;abstract’ and \u0026lsquo;concrete\u0026rsquo;: the \u0026lsquo;concrete’, for instance, is supposed to be a determination of the abstract. But this language-use has nothing to do with what I am saying in chapter 3.\nIn other words, the words \u0026lsquo;concrete/abstract’ (or the meaning of these words) is not the religious idea I am referring to. I am referring to the idea that concrete/abstract are characteristics of human thought at a certain stages in its development. (Like infant/adult; female/male; primitive/modern; \u0026lsquo;superstitious’/scientific, etc.)\nAbout cutting themes \u0026rsquo;loose’ from a theological framework. I suggest we wait for some time (at least till chapter 7) before we discuss this. Issues are not that simple\n","tags":[],"title":"Secular theme: cognitive stages of development -- concrete vs abstract","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/secular-theme-cognitive-stages-of-development-concrete-vs-abstract/"},{"categories":["Jakob","published","terrorism"],"content":"After the Paris attacks came the questions: Is this violence caused by Islam or unrelated to religion? Are the perpetrators believers or madmen? Do they represent the extremists that we find in any ideology?\nThe responses were diverse: ‘Islam is a threat to free speech’. But many Muslims joined the protest marches in defence of the freedom of expression. ‘Not all Muslims are terrorists, but most terrorists are Muslims’. The statistics show otherwise. ‘Madmen have neither colour nor religion’. Yet the ‘professionals’ in Paris screamed ‘Allahu Akbar’. And then appeared the magical word ‘radicalization’. From the mayor to the teacher, from the politician to the policeman, everyone now knows what the problem is and where we should look for solutions: strict measures against ‘radicalized Muslims’ and ‘deradicalization programmes’ developed by ‘radicalization experts’.\nThe moderate and the radical\nDo these words have any value? ‘Radicalization’ presupposes a shift from a moderate to a radical position. How do we then distinguish a radicalized from a moderate Muslim?\nThe answer appears to lie in their religious beliefs. Yet, here, the differences are not so significant. ‘Islam is the only true religion’. ‘The purpose of human existence is to worship Allah’. ‘The Quran is His Word and Muhammad the Last Prophet’. Accepting the truth of these beliefs is essential to being a Muslim. ‘Nobody should insult or depict the prophet’. Not only the Paris terrorist thinks so, but also the London schoolgirl and millions of protesters from Pakistan to Chechnya. Are all these people ‘radicalized’?\nThe absurdity of this vocabulary becomes clear when we apply it to other religions. What would it mean to be a ‘moderate’ Christian? That one has a moderate faith in God or believes only somewhat that Jesus is His Son and the Bible His Word? Either one accepts the truth of a religion or one does not; it cannot make sense to do so ‘moderately’.\nTo Muslims, Islam is the one true revelation of God’s will, to which all humans should submit themselves (and not just Arabs or Iranians). The demand that we should respect the Quran and the prophet indirectly imposes the truth of this religion onto all of us. Indeed, this conflicts with the freedom of expression. However, if this is the problem of radicalization, then ‘deradicalization’ entails that Muslims are not allowed to be Muslims, but should convert to some ‘moderate’ belief. That would be a major infringement of religious freedom.\nOf course, only few Muslims go around killing infidels. Does radicalization revolve around the use of violence in the name of beliefs? This condemns the notion to triviality. In that case, ‘radicalization’ should also mark the difference between a man who sues a thief and one who kills him in the name of property rights. From this perspective, resistance fighters become victims of ‘radicalization’, when they fight dictators because of their faith in democracy.\nTerrorism and heroism\nThe term ‘radicalization’ is a label that hides our ignorance about the core problem of terrorism. S.N. Balagangadhara, a professor at Ghent University, Belgium, has developed a powerful hypothesis about this phenomenon. Typical to terrorism is its transformation of crime into heroism. The terrorist commits murders but experiences his acts as expressions of an extraordinary morality.\nConsider a man who cannot swim but dives into the ocean to save a child. This is not his moral duty but an act of heroism. Another man walks into a school and randomly shoots children. This is a horrible crime. Still, the terrorist gives to these acts the same status: they are the exemplary deeds of saints and heroes.\nSurprisingly, terrorists share certain beliefs about crime and morality with us. When our child is killed as ‘collateral damage’, we would find this as immoral as they do. The average terrorist considers violence against his people as criminal as we would. He resents the Saudi regime that beheads his friends to punish them for political dissent. Paradoxically, we seem to belong to the same moral community.\nNevertheless, terrorists like the men in Paris hold values that conflict with those of contemporary Europe: say, the subordination of women and intolerance towards other religions. They enjoy executing a man because of his convictions. What allows them to see the beheading of a man as a crime in one case and a heroic act in another case? How can they be blind to this internal conflict?\nTerrorists always connect to a specific community and consider the rest of humanity as hostile forces, deserving death and mutilation. Some identify with the Palestinian people; others with a Muslim community in Pakistan. But even there, they soon turn against these moral communities. In Pakistan, the Taliban slaughters children in the name of Islam. In Gaza, Hamas threatens to kill off its enemies within the Palestinian people.\nEverywhere, terrorism converts the criminal into the praiseworthy. It can graft itself onto almost any group or belief – from nationalism to egalitarianism, from communism to Zionism, from Christianity to Islam. While terrorism exists independently of any religion or ideology, it always attaches itself to one. Criminals metamorphose into heroes by calling upon God’s will, but as easily by invoking American patriotism. By accepting that some terrorists are ‘radical Muslims’, we succumb to their self-description. Today, they merge with Islam to justify their violent crimes. Tomorrow, they might call upon ‘freedom and equality’ and describe their ‘heroic acts’ as a fight against oppression. Will we then re-baptize them as ‘radical Enlightenment thinkers’?\nSubversion\nThis hypothesis throws light onto the disproportional impact terrorism has on our societies. The terrorist seems to share our moral convictions but uses them to convert ordinary murder into extraordinary morality. He equates blowing up a school to saving a baby from a burning building. This is horrifying because it undermines any moral foundation for our societies. We need to examine the learning process that gives shape to the experience of terrorists – the mechanism that allows them to transform crime into heroism. This is the process that takes place in prisons and during training camps and trips to Syria. We could call this ‘radicalization’, but this only misleads.\nThe terrorist is no ‘radicalized’ Muslim. What makes him into a terrorist is that he converts his misdeeds into the feats of saints and heroes. He calls upon the values of a community only to subvert its foundations. His victory is that we continue this process as a part of ‘the war on terrorism’ – sacrificing democratic freedoms in the name of saving democracy. Perhaps that is the greatest danger facing today’s Europe.\n","tags":[],"title":"The Magic of ‘Radicalization’?","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/the-magic-of-radicalization/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","caste"],"content":" As I have said before, my hypothesis is meant to guide the research and, as such, suggests that we find that the Brahmins will exhibit more of a heterarchical organization than a hierarchical one. Let us assume that what you say is true. In that case, this anomaly (or these anomalies) will become the problem(s) that my hypothesis has to solve. That is, the hypothesis will force one to look for an explanation in multiple directions: for instance, have these hierarchies emerged due to induction of new groups and individuals in the course of history? (That means, this hypothesis forces one to probe the truth of the statement that once one is born into a jati, there is no way of moving to another Jati. The Madhva conversion in South India has disproved it but no one I know has taken this fact into consideration.) Who were the majority jati\u0026rsquo;s in the area and what was the nature of interaction between these Brahmin groups and other Jati\u0026rsquo;s? And so on. In other words, each anomaly we confront forces further research. There is always the possibility that my research hypothesis will crumble under the weight of accumulated anomalies but that is not the case yet. At the moment, they merely call for further research.\nSecond, my hypothesis suggests that both hierarchical and heterarchical organizations flourished in India and that \u0026rsquo;the social structure\u0026rsquo; consisted of mechanisms that allowed both organizations to interact with each other, reproduce themselves and expand. In the course of interactions between two groups, as I have already mentioned, groups will borrow many things from one another, including forms of organization. This means that my hypothesis does not forbid the existence of some hierarchical upper caste groups in certain regions and sub-regions in India. But it does predict some kind of visible uniformity. Only research can tell us whether this uniformity is there or not. Anecdotes help, to be sure, but they do not decide the case.\nThe above point stands to reason because no central authority \u0026lsquo;imposed\u0026rsquo; a specific form of social organization in India. This means that groups organized themselves \u0026lsquo;spontaneously\u0026rsquo;: many discovering the same forms of organizations on their own, others borrowing from others, others through modification of what emerged, and so on. In other words, we would expect to find multiple empirical combinations throughout India. This too, says the hypothesis, is something that is to be expected. Consequently, this hypothesis becomes sensitive to the historical, changing and dynamic nature of the structure of group organizations. There will be no changeless, static \u0026lsquo;caste system\u0026rsquo; to be found in India. Yet, some general trends will emerge and the hypothesis also directs one\u0026rsquo;s attention towards them.\nAt the moment, you must remember, I am simply suggesting that we map hierarchy and heterarchy onto one single axis, namely, \u0026lsquo;Madi\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;purity\u0026rsquo;. We also need to define further axes: perhaps, power, authority, lineage etc should also be used to define hierarchy and heterarchy. At this moment, I am merely proposing the next step of research along one axis. Only after a few years of sustained fieldwork in multiple parts of India would we be able to say something more concrete about it. This is not the only kind of research that requires doing: we need to dig into the historical archives, read about the nature of human organizations, study archaeological records, and so on. All that my hypothesis can do at the moment is to propose a course of enquiry that none is following.\n","tags":[],"title":"Caste Sytem III","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/caste-system-iii/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","caste"],"content":"Two small points before I respond to your questions. One: all I have is a hypothesis that can guide research. In itself, it is not a theory and I cannot hope to convince anyone (at this stage) that this hypothesis is true. It requires years of research (of different kinds) before it can be made compelling. Therefore, please know that I understand your skepticism and find it only natural. Two: However, I will give you some indications about why I find the hypothesis interesting and worthy of further research. I will choose some examples at random to indicate the kind of problems that this hypothesis promises to solve.\nOf course, you are right about the fact that many Brahmin groups either fight for superiority or merely believe in the superiority of their own \u0026lsquo;jati\u0026rsquo;s\u0026rsquo;. While there is nothing wrong about it, I do not consider either of them as an indication of hierarchy. For instance, the Smartha\u0026rsquo;s the Saivas and the Vaisnavites also fight each other and proclaim their own superiority over the other groups. But that does not mean that we can organize them hierarchically. Nor can they do so themselves. The same applies, for instance, to the followers of Jnana, Karma, Bhakti and Yoga paths to enlightenment. While each fights the other and proclaims its own superiority, it is not possible to organize them hierarchically, even though there are some sporadic attempts by the followers of these traditions to do precisely that. In this sense, while the Havyaka\u0026rsquo;s might think they are the \u0026lsquo;superior\u0026rsquo; Brahmins, there is no way to rank them vertically with respect to other Brahmin groups.\nThis stands in contrast to the hierarchy that seems to exist among the so-called lower castes. Here, there seems to a hierarchy in the pecking order: for instance, the fight between Madiga and Holeya groups in Karnataka does not resemble the fight between, say, Madhva and Smartha groups or between the \u0026lsquo;Babburkamme\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;Havyaka\u0026rsquo; jatis. In the former case, there are stricter \u0026lsquo;rules\u0026rsquo; about inter-dining, marriage, entering the house and so on. I have this in mind when I speak about the hierarchical organization among the so-called Lower castes. Let me illustrate this by using the CSLC research. They tried to ascertain \u0026lsquo;social hierarchy\u0026rsquo; that might or might not exist between different jati\u0026rsquo;s from the Brahmins at one end of the spectrum to, say, Kuruba\u0026rsquo;s at the other end. Here, they were unable to find any (or many) indications of a hierarchy. This research suggests that it might be foolish to look for a \u0026lsquo;caste hierarchy\u0026rsquo; (that tracks the Varna system in some way or another) in the Indian society. Now comes the next stage of research, about which we need to think more carefully. Are there jati distinctions, say, within and among the Madiga\u0026rsquo;s in different parts of Karnataka? Do they have \u0026lsquo;rules\u0026rsquo; about marriage, dining, entering houses, rituals and festivals and so on and so forth with respect to intra-Madiga intercourse? This internal differentiation is what I am talking about now. It is my hypothesis that, if and when fieldwork is conducted by using many dimensions (and assigning weights to them is some form or another), we will see a hierarchy emerging within the Madiga communities. The next step is to plot this hierarchy within the Madiga community against a similar investigation into the Holeya\u0026rsquo;s. At that stage, we will begin to see whether or not my hypothesis about a hierarchy among the so-called lower caste groups will require changes.\nThis hierarchy among the so-called lower caste groups DOES NOT constitute \u0026rsquo;the social structure\u0026rsquo; of India or Karnataka. At best, the research into the structure of these so-called lower castes will tell uswhether their jati organization is hierarchical or not. What the Europeans did was to generalize the organizational structure of the different caste groups as though this constituted the social structure of the Indian society. Having thus (falsely) believed that, say, the structure of the Madiga\u0026rsquo;s and the nature of their interaction with the Hoelya\u0026rsquo;s constituted the social structure of the society, they looked for a \u0026rsquo;theoretical framework\u0026rsquo; to accommodate this \u0026lsquo;fact\u0026rsquo;. And they found that in, say, the Purusha Sukta and Manu. Then they looked for \u0026lsquo;culprits\u0026rsquo; who were responsible for thrusting such a social structure on the throats of all people. They found them in the \u0026lsquo;Brahmin Priests\u0026rsquo;.\nThe social structure of India consists of those mechanisms that allow BOTH the hierarchical and heterarchical organizational structures to co-exist and interact with each other, and to reproduce themselves. These mechanisms themselves will be structured and these constitute \u0026rsquo;the social structure\u0026rsquo; of India. Thus, unlike Europe, where primarily hierarchical organizations existed and reproduced themselves, in India, by contrast, a plurality of organizational structures flourished without problems. That is what I am talking about.\nWhat can this hypothesis do? Some random facts. For instance, it explains why the followers of the Madhva tradition are so crazy about \u0026lsquo;madi\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;purity\u0026rsquo;. They have a very strict sense of \u0026lsquo;hierarchy\u0026rsquo; even though they are unable to identify the hierarchies among the Brahmin jati\u0026rsquo;s. This hypothesis suggests that one should seek an explanation for this in the fact that Madhva\u0026rsquo;s were recruited (initially) from the so-called lower castes. On other dimensions, the Lingayat\u0026rsquo;s exhibit similar problems about \u0026lsquo;Jati\u0026rsquo;s\u0026rsquo; within them. Whenever one looks at a \u0026lsquo;Dalit\u0026rsquo; rebel against the caste system, invariably, it transpires, that these Dalit heroes have been helped exclusively (and only) by Brahmins. Why? The hypothesis suggests that that is because the Brahmins are least \u0026lsquo;sensitive\u0026rsquo; to hierarchies because they, as a social group, have the least experience of hierarchy. (This also explains why the most anti-caste initiators are from the so-called upper castes: they do not have much experience of the hierarchical structure. Not because they are at the \u0026rsquo;top\u0026rsquo; of the hierarchy: a king or a prime minister is acutely aware of the hierarchy, not oblivious to it.) Even where they have hierarchies (at home, in society), there are multiple loci of authorities: for instance, if a \u0026lsquo;guru\u0026rsquo; enjoins you to do something and your father enjoins you the opposite, who do you follow? Should you follow your grandfather or do what your father tells you to? Each such situation signals that the problem of power and authority is way too complicated to allow any hierarchical classification. Equally, consider the fact that the most well-known \u0026lsquo;rebels\u0026rsquo; against \u0026rsquo;the caste system\u0026rsquo; are also those who come from the so-called lower castes. There are many ways to explain this: they experienced oppression the most, they are against experienced injustice and so on. What does this mean except to say that they are obsessed by the caste system only because hierarchy was their daily experience? However, this daily experience was not with the Brahmin jati\u0026rsquo;s but with their own.\nIf this hypothesis can be supported through further research, its impact on colonial consciousness is gigantic: it will blow a big hole in it, while weakening its structural integrity. Our discourse about politics, state, reservation, voting patterns, etc will have to be entirely rethought. If the Dalit and secular intellectuals discover that \u0026rsquo;the caste system\u0026rsquo; was merely a generalization of the internal hierarchy among the so-called lower castes, they need to look deeper into themselves and identify the problems anew. The extant descriptions about \u0026lsquo;social justice\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;affirmative action\u0026rsquo; etc cannot be used any more. Our intellectuals will be forced to look at India afresh and rethink how they should describe India, her society and culture. All the books about \u0026rsquo;the caste system\u0026rsquo; written by Europeans and regurgitated by the Indian intellectuals during the last 350 years will, all of a sudden, not be worth the paper they are printed on. The Constitution of India requires an overhaul the way descriptions of Hinduism and India will also be due for an overhaul.\nIn other words, the time is ripe to move the research one step forward. Until now, we have mainly argued that \u0026rsquo;the caste system\u0026rsquo; does not exist in India. Now we have to take the next step: explain how and why (both through fieldwork and through theoretical research) people say what they have said and say. In this process, hopefully, we will being the process of also saying what there is.\n","tags":[],"title":"Caste System II","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/caste-system-ii/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","caste"],"content":" You ask whether \u0026ldquo;there is a perception of caste hierarchies among Brahmins\u0026rdquo;. My guess is that there is no such general perception, even if, regionally, multiple Brahmin jati\u0026rsquo;s fight for superiority. There is no way to establish, say, that the \u0026lsquo;Babburkamme\u0026rsquo; is superior to \u0026lsquo;Havyaka\u0026rsquo; in Karnataka. In fact, many from either of the two would not even know of the existence of the other. In Bangalore itself, for instance, where the former is preponderant, I did not even know of their existence until I was 15 years old. In this sense, even in areas where they might claim to \u0026lsquo;superiority\u0026rsquo;, it is difficult to establish hierarchies among the Brahmins in any one region. This, as I say, is my guess.\nFurther you notice that \u0026ldquo;there are more caste hierarchies among the so-called lower castes\u0026rdquo;. This is the important element. It is my hypothesis that it is primarily (almost exclusively, I would like to think) among the so-called lower castes that there is a clear sense of caste hierarchy. In fact, the so-called \u0026lsquo;caste hierarchy\u0026rsquo; is present only among them, I would like to speculate. It is these groups that got converted: into Islam, into Veersaivism (the lingayats), into Christianity and so on. Through conversion, they took their \u0026lsquo;caste hierarchies\u0026rsquo; into these traditions and religions. The Europeans converted these so-called lower castes into Christianity and observed \u0026lsquo;caste hierarchies\u0026rsquo; among these new Christians. They also \u0026lsquo;knew\u0026rsquo; the existence of other Jati\u0026rsquo;s, read verses about the purusha sukta, and also had Brahmins to assure them that they, the Brahmins, were the \u0026lsquo;best\u0026rsquo; group. Thus there emerged the story about \u0026rsquo;the caste structure\u0026rsquo; in India, which contained two elements: the story about the Varna system that has little or nothing to do with \u0026rsquo;the caste system\u0026rsquo; and its alleged hierarchy, and the manifest \u0026lsquo;caste hierarchy\u0026rsquo; among the newly inducted Christians. The varna system was a way of roughly describing the social stratification at a very high level of generality; the \u0026lsquo;caste system\u0026rsquo; was an empirical description of the hierarchy that existed primarily (and, perhaps, exclusively) among the so-called lower castes. The Europeans generalized the latter as \u0026rsquo;the social structure\u0026rsquo; of India but put it within the framework of the Varna system. Thus the hybrid beast of today that we call \u0026rsquo;the caste system\u0026rsquo;.\nIn other words, what we call \u0026rsquo;the caste system\u0026rsquo; of today is a generalization of this caste hierarchy as the dominant social structure of the Indian society. If this hypothesis can be shown to be true, then it can also be shown that \u0026rsquo;the caste system\u0026rsquo; is NOT an invention of the \u0026lsquo;Brahmin Priests\u0026rsquo; but the gift of the so-called Lower castes in India. That is, the \u0026lsquo;Scheduled Castes\u0026rsquo; in India are the real progenitors of the \u0026lsquo;Indian caste system\u0026rsquo; and not the upper castes. The Europeans, in their mixture of arrogance and ignorance, simply claimed that the Jati structure that exists mostly, if not only, among the \u0026lsquo;Dalits\u0026rsquo; is identical to the \u0026lsquo;social structure\u0026rsquo; in India. The Indian \u0026lsquo;intellectuals\u0026rsquo; simply took over this story and repeat them endlessly.\nThis hypothesis is able to account for so many perceived facts about jati\u0026rsquo;s and Varna that I believe that it is close to being true. But it is going to take a lot of research to show that this is also the case.\n","tags":[],"title":"Caste hierarchies","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/caste-hierarchies/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","caste"],"content":" Let me reconsider the hypothesis I propose: what we call \u0026rsquo;the caste system\u0026rsquo; in India today is a hybrid beast. It is not a social structure but a linguistic entity (i.e., a set of sentences) which is an incoherent admixture to two unconnected descriptions (of the world): a generalization of the description of a structured set of interactions (let us leave aside the question of what kind of mathematical properties that this \u0026lsquo;structured set\u0026rsquo; has: how it is ordered, whether the ordering is strong or weak and so on) among the so-called \u0026rsquo;lower castes\u0026rsquo;, while fitting this description within the framework of the varna system, which, I say, is a description of social stratification at a very high level of abstraction or generality. It is incoherent by virtue of its claim to being a \u0026lsquo;unified\u0026rsquo; (and unifying) description of the social structure of Indian society: it collapses descriptions of different things at different levels (of descriptions) into a single alleged description of social reality. That is why these \u0026rsquo;theories\u0026rsquo; of caste are either incoherent, nonsensical or, where neither, false.\nA collection of individuals become a group when their interactions become structured. Such structured interactions give rise to organizations and institutions, which, in their turn, further structure individual interactions. We know of two basic types of organizations: hierarchical organizations and heterarchical organizations. These are descriptions of two ends of a spectrum: in the world, we come across organizations which are mixtures of both. In its simplest form, we can understand them through a spatial metaphor: vertical forms of interactions are hierarchical, whereas horizontal forms are heterarchical. An army with a central command-and-control centre is an example par excellence of a hierarchical organization; a human brain, according to most who work on this, is an example of a heterarchical organizations with multiple modules. Of course, in these examples, the emphasis lies on performing specialized functions: the infantry cannot do what commando units do; multiple areas in the brain can take over and perform \u0026lsquo;specialized\u0026rsquo; functions. Keep this as a rough analogy to understand what I want to say.\nWe can map hierarchy into multiple axes: power, authority, specializations. And so on. In the hypothesis I am proposing, I am simply mapping them to \u0026lsquo;madi\u0026rsquo; (in Kannada, which roughly translates as \u0026lsquo;purity\u0026rsquo;). This word includes many things in its scope: commensality, marriage, entry into the house, bathing. and so on. \u0026lsquo;Madi\u0026rsquo; would represent the result of such a multi-dimensional graph, where each of these elements themselves represent the many different axes. What my hypothesis suggests is this: if we map the so-called lower castes along the axis of \u0026lsquo;Madi\u0026rsquo;(which, as I say, is multi-dimensional), then we will get a vertical line of these Jati\u0026rsquo;s. This is all I mean, for the time being, when I speak of \u0026lsquo;hierarchy\u0026rsquo;: these jati\u0026rsquo;s can be vertically ordered in a graph. As against this, if we map, say the Brahmins along the same axes, then we get a more or less horizontal graph. If we map these two groups on the same graph, the so-called \u0026lsquo;higher castes\u0026rsquo; will be spread over the horizontal axis, whereas the so-called \u0026rsquo;lower castes\u0026rsquo; will be spread along the vertical axis. Showing this to be the case in India will require years of field work in multiple parts of India.\nAssuming, hypothetically, this to be the case, how do we understand this phenomenon? At the moment, I see this as the difference between Jati\u0026rsquo;s and Sampradaayas: the former names a hierarchical organization whereas the latter names a heterarchical organization. In India, both forms of interactions emerged and spread the way the institutions spread: through discovery, imitation and so on. The Indian society, as a whole, evolved mechanisms that could sustain and reproduce both Jati\u0026rsquo;s and Sampradaayas. Through mutual interaction between these two groups, there were borrowing of terminologies across them, imitation of group formation and the emergence of \u0026rsquo;ethnic\u0026rsquo; groups in the Indian society. Understanding the Indian social structure requires an insight into this complex process. (This requires serious historical and theoretical study over a number of years.)\nIn other words, I am assuming that when people develop structured sets of interactions, the resulting organization is either hierarchical or heterarchical in some respect or another. Though the \u0026lsquo;why\u0026rsquo; is a very important question, I do not answer it: I just presuppose the answer as true. Consequently, that such structures develop among human groups (even when they are isolated from each other) is not an issue I am concerned with. However, with respect to India, the following will be predictable: when \u0026lsquo;madi\u0026rsquo; itself gets split into multiple dimensions and mapped to jati\u0026rsquo;s (and to Sampradaayas), there will be observable variations with respect to the \u0026lsquo;weights\u0026rsquo; given to these different dimensions. But, that is not a problem, but the result of the absence of a centralized organization in India.\nNow, to your other concerns. You are talking about the role of the Varna system in the Indian culture. Whatever might or might not have been the case, the point is how it has been transmitted to us. We now need to add a new twist to the story about the colonial consciousness: while, in one sense, this notion suggests that the transmission of our tradition has been arrested and damaged it also suggests that some aspects of these traditions have been transmitted to us, but by the Europeans. That is to say, our understanding of the European understanding of India \u0026lsquo;defines\u0026rsquo; us non-trivially as well. It is true, I think, that Varna \u0026lsquo;system\u0026rsquo; was a set of action-heuristics in India of yesteryears, but it is not (primarily) that to us anymore. Some of us sense this difference, thanks to the fact that our traditions are still transmitted to us. But, today, Varna plays the primary role of a very abstract description of social stratification (this is how we understand the British transmission of the Indian traditions to us).\nTo understand better what I mean by the last sentence, consider this: the only way you or I can formulate \u0026lsquo;varna\u0026rsquo; as a set of heuristics is to formulate the question in terms of: what does it mean to be, say, a Brahmin today? Notice the perfect analogy between this question and \u0026lsquo;what does it mean to be a Christian?\u0026rsquo; (Quid sit Christianum esse?) Until we have developed a very rich theory, we cannot even formulate the notion of Varna as a set of action heuristics. At best, it becomes a question about the Christian; at worst, it is a straightforward moral code.\n","tags":[],"title":"Caste system I","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/caste-system-i/"},{"categories":["basics","Jakob","religion"],"content":" One confuses between a definition and a hypothesis. Definitions tell us how we use a word and which objects it refers to. In the case of the term ‘religion’, a definition should merely address this referential task: which things are we referring to, when we use this word. It cannot give us any understanding of the structure or properties of religion and does not have empirical consequences (much as defining any other word, say ‘species’ or ‘psychosis’, does not have empirical consequences). It merely points out the phenomena that are to be theorized. The result of this second process of theorizing is a hypothesis, which characterizes the properties or structure of a phenomenon.\nWhen one confuses between defining a word and theorizing a phenomenon, as you do, one enters a dead-end: it is as though the task of a definition is to classify objects and decide whether or not they belong to a particular category. But this generates disputes that cannot be settled. Imagine one scholar who defines ‘religion’ as a belief in supernatural and non-empirically verifiable beings. Another points out that ancient Greek religion does not involve any supernatural beings (since Greek theoi belong to the natural world) and that ‘religion’ requires another definition. The first author then says that they are non-empirically verifiable entities and, therefore, ancient Greek traditions do belong to the category of religion. But then the second points out that many particles predicted by theoretical physics are not empirically verifiable; hence, theoretical physics would also be a religion according to this definition. Our second author could then point out that we need a definition focusing on family resemblances or that \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo; should be defined as \u0026lsquo;a set of methods for spiritual uplift\u0026rsquo; for everything religious falls under this umbrella. But then another guy comes and points out that taking heroin is also a method for spiritual uplift. So is this also religion? Etcetera.\nThis type of exchange illustrates the problem: when one confuses the task of defining ‘religion’ (by pointing out its referent) with the task of classification, one ends up in disputes as interminable as disputes about taste. Scholars are busy inventing definitions that should accommodate their intuition that all cultures have religion or that some tradition is ‘not really a religion’. The resulting definitions are inadequate and increasingly vague. Consequently, we now face a cemetery of discarded definitions of ‘religion’.\nWhen Balu suggests that religion is an explanatorily intelligible account of the cosmos and itself, he is not providing a definition but a hypothesis. Of course, as a first step, the term ‘religion’ needs to be defined so that we know which object(s) should be theorized. We could say that ‘religion’ has no referents in the world, but this is an epistemic decision that cannot be taken before developing a theory. Instead, Balu suggests the following: we provide an ostensive definition of ‘religion’ by pointing out an instance of how we use the word. Minimally, ‘religion’ refers to Christianity, since Christianity has used the word to refer to itself and to certain others. Only in that sense, Christianity is taken as a prototypical example of what we refer to when we use the word ‘religion’.\nBalu then characterizes some of the constraints that any hypothesis about religion should live up to. First, Christianity has used the term ‘religion’ to refer to itself and to certain others as its religious rivals: Islam, Judaism, Roman religio, Hindu traditions … This has resulted in a particular set of descriptions invoking the term ‘religion’. Second, Islam and Judaism not only recognized themselves in such descriptions, but also provided similar descriptions of each other and of Christianity. Moreover, they described the same others (Roman religio in the case of Judaism, Hindu traditions in the case of Islam) as religious rivals. Thus, using whatever word they may have used, they share a basic notion of religion with Christianity. Third, the followers of Roman religio and the Hindu traditions recognized neither themselves nor Islam and Christianity in these descriptions. In fact, they showed a remarkable indifference and blindness towards the idea that all of these were religious rivals.\nAny hypothesis about religion should be able to account for this dual set of historical facts. That is, it should explain as to why the Semitic religions recognized each other and the same others as religious rivals and why the ‘pagan’ traditions failed to recognize themselves and the relevant others in these descriptions. It is not a good idea to develop the required hypothesis about religion through an inductive approach: that is, we cannot study the enormous body of descriptions that Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and the ‘pagan’ traditions have given of each other and then try to infer a hypothesis that accounts for all these descriptions.\nInstead, Balu takes a very different route: that of formulating a hypothesis and deriving its logical and empirical consequences so as to test whether the hypothesis is able to account for past phenomena and predict new facts. Now, since this hypothesis does not rely on induction (inferring some common structure of religion by culling over the available body of descriptions), it is not constructed by accepting any ‘Christian’ or ‘Abrahamic’ concept or definition of religion. Rather than being founded in any such concept or definition, it is formulated independently. Consequently, its relation to the available body of ‘Abrahamic’ and ‘pagan’ conceptions of religion is entirely different. These function as a test or constraint for the hypothesis: it should account for both sets of conceptions as manifested in their historical encounters. And it does.\nOnce you get these points, you will see that what you write stems from a basic ignorance of Balu’s work.\nFor more on the business of definitions, check the first chapter of \u0026ldquo;Reconceptualizing India studies\u0026rdquo; and the eighth chapter of \u0026ldquo;The Heathen in his blindness: Asia, the West and the dynamic of religion\u0026rdquo;.\n","tags":[],"title":"Defininition vs hypothesis: religion","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/definition-hypothesis-religion/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","enlightenment","Indian traditions"],"content":"Balagangadhara\u0026rsquo;s recent article on Enlightenment (Gyanodaya); this is based on his enlightenment.

Why did Indians convert to Islam so massively in the 19th Century? Why did Christianity spread so quickly after Constantine? What accounts for the growth of Western Christianity, while its Eastern variant languished? Why is Islam growing the fastest in the world today? Etc.

Etc. Add to these some other answers like a) conversion to Christianity requires that the Holy Spirit is active; b) it is the will of Allah and such like.\nEach of these answers, and many more, have been given and continue to be given on the basis of (i) empirical research; (ii) speculations and (iii) theologies.\nWhich of these answers are true or plausible or probable? What would you choose between a ‘political’ answer, a ‘sociological’ answer, a ‘philosophical answer’, a ‘historical’ answer, a ‘theological answer’…etc? Would you choose one, some, all or none? Why? Where (meaning, in which domain) would you look to answer those questions you raise?\nThe previous paragraph tells you that the questions raised in the second paragraph are ill-formed: any and every reply are answers to questions; we do not know where to look for answers because the search-space is very, very broad. We know at least this much about good questions: they narrow the search space. The questions above do the opposite: they broaden the search-space. (Why is the following not an answer to all the questions asked: ‘because Freud’s first name is Sigmund’? You cannot dismiss this as an answer without relying on some or another ‘philosophical’ idea about ‘evidence’ and ‘relevance’, using which one can also dismiss every other answer.)\nThese questions are not scientific: they are commonsense questions that are pseudo-scientific in nature. They appeal only to commonsense because they arise from there.\nIf reformulated, they do make sense: why did Christianity spread as a religion in Europe and the Middle-East? The only answer to this question is theological in nature. Why did people convert to one religion or another? The answer can be theological or something else depending upon how you qualify ‘conversion’: if it carries a theological meaning, the answer cannot be ‘economic’. If qualified, say, sociologically, (say, as the act of baptism or performing some or another ceremony in the presence of a mullah) then a ‘sociological’ answer will do. And so on.\nThe research programme tells us these things too: it allows us to assess the nature of our questions and the nature of contemporary ‘scholarship’ (or what parades as ‘religious studies’ today). Not every question, just because it is ‘investigated’, qualifies itself as scientific research. (After all, one ‘investigates’ before creating a telephone directory.

An answer to the latter does not necessarily count as an answer to the first. In fact, the tendency to counter the proselytising drive of Christianity and Islam by voting laws against conversion is itself an indication of India’s cultural weakness. Hence, it cannot be a means to re-kindle the flame of India’s pluralistic tradition. It strikes me that now-a-days Indians feel very comfortable with the terms of the discussion when it comes to the problem of ‘Christianity/Islam versus Hinduism’. It has not always been like that. As we all know, the British were not the first to colonise India. The Mughals had done so before. What is very interesting is the way in which the Indians absorbed this foreign power and its religion. When you take history writing (or historiography) as an example, it is very striking that the Mughal power was presented within the Indian mythological framework. (As scholars never grow tired of pointing out, Indian history writing differs from the western ‘scientific mode’ in that it mixes facts with fiction. However, for the point I want to make here, this discussion is irrelevant.) As a result, the Muslim emperors, for example, turned up as incarnations of Indian gods. Or, that their birth was foreseen long ago and, and as such, they became part of India’s history, etc. The point that I want to make is that the Indian history writers never experienced the Mughals and their Islam as a foreign religion threatening the religion of the Indians. One could say that religion was not an issue. The Mughals, from their part, were able to maintain their power - at least partially - by adjusting their behaviour and acting like native Indian kings. The most striking example, of course, is that they granted lands to build temples and financially supported their construction. However, when European history writing took over, the idea of a great divide between the period before the Muslims and after was generally accepted. In this sense Hermione is right when she says that the beauty of the Indian civilization is in it\u0026rsquo;s immense capacity to absorb outside influences without succumbing to them. But she is wrong when she infers Why do we seek to change our strategy now? The problem is that the strategy has changed, and it has changed in the sense that the Indian intelligentsia conceptualises the problem in terms that do not resonate with India’s capacity to absorb alien influences. The conceptualisation is at odds with what makes India’s culture differ from the West. As a result the knowledge that was there to cope with extreme differences is no longer accessible.

Before one addresses oneself to the role that \u0026lsquo;power\u0026rsquo; played in the proselytizing drive of Christianity, one needs to know what proselytization means. Consider the role that the Emperors played in Rome (and the role played by some Kings in India.) They would promote some or another tradition (or \u0026lsquo;cult\u0026rsquo;, as they were called in the Roman Empire), persecute the followers of some or another tradition (or cult). Does that mean that the cults proselytized too, or that they were as \u0026lsquo;intolerant\u0026rsquo; as the Semitic religions? To affirm either of the two is to lose any ability to understand the difference between Indian traditions (or the Roman cults) and the Semitic religions. In order to talk of the ground reality in India, one needs to have answers to the following question: Is the \u0026lsquo;Eastern Christianity\u0026rsquo; in India inherently less proselytizing (i.e. does the muted proselytizing drive of the \u0026lsquo;Eastern Christianity\u0026rsquo; in India have to do with its difference from the \u0026lsquo;Western Christianity\u0026rsquo;), or does this have to do with the impact of Indian culture upon this brand of Christianity?\nThose who want to sing the song of the \u0026lsquo;superiority\u0026rsquo; of the \u0026lsquo;Eastern\u0026rsquo; brand against the \u0026lsquo;Western\u0026rsquo; brand of Christianity would do well to take heed of the following problem: how did (say) the Russian, or the Syrian, or the Greek Christianities spread in Russia, Syria (before Islam) or Greece, if the \u0026lsquo;Eastern\u0026rsquo; Churches did not aggressively proselytize? A diagonal look at the writings of (say) St. Augustine should quickly disabuse us of the silly idea that the expansion of Christianity was, somehow, fundamentally tied to political power. Of course, its ties to the throne did facilitate much. But the proselytizing drive in the Semitic religions is fundamentally independent of any kind of political or economic power. If we lose sight of some of these fundamental facts of history, and do not try to figure out the theological justifications offered by the various brands of Christianity, we are talking through our hats.\n","tags":[],"title":"Proselytization vs. Persecution","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/proselytization-vs-persecution/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","basics","theory-ladenness"],"content":"Depending on the context of the discussion (say a dispute about some aspect of the Indian culture), the disputants can treat wearing the bindi or a saree as facts. However, in another context of the discussion, these facts might become theoretical claims. For instance, is the Indian woman wearing a bindi or an Indian male wearing kumkum on his forehead being religious or not? Consider, for instance, the recent French legislation about wearing religious \u0026lsquo;symbols\u0026rsquo; in the public. If someone decides to take an Indian to the court, then wearing bindi or kumkum becomes an issue of dispute. Then we will have disputes: one side will claim that it is religious, and the other will probably want to say that it is not religious. (If it happens, I suggest they use \u0026lsquo;The Heathen in His Blindness: Asia, the West and the dynamic of religion\u0026rsquo;!) In such a case, wearing a bindi will be described using two kinds of theories about wearing a bindi.\nEditor\u0026rsquo;s note: the foregoing is about heathens\u0026rsquo; wearing bindis. How about Indian Christians\u0026rsquo; wearing bindis? Once upon a time, such a practice was called idolatrous. Today, the practice is called secular. Here, Christian theology answers the question about which practice is secular, which idolatrous, and which religious. In the case of heathens in France, the state is taking the stance of Christian theology by branding as religious, the wearing of bindis. For heathens, wearing a bindi is part of tradition; for urban Indian Christians, it is part of the secular domain: here, two theories (one about tradition; the other about religion-secular-idolatrus) accomodate the same phenomenon/practice, even though those theories (a generic Christian theology and comparative science of cultures) are competitors to understand the Indian culture.\nComments Joseph Louis — 2016-11-19 21:06:07\nKindly come to the point.

Here, as it suits thoughtful minds, one tries to express ideas carefully and in a nuanced fashion. Recent peer-opinions are taken into account; generalizations are avoided; the attention is on the specific and the concrete; and, where possible, one’s ideas are either founded upon or embroidered by some or another of the many philosophical stances that are available. The goal of the discussion is to endorse these opinions, or express disagreement on the broad idea expressed by the author. Any other kind of intellectual exercise of often seen as either nit-picking or engaging in polemics. To those who have grown up in this culture, it is obvious what the sought-after intellectual virtues are and how one should cultivate it. In other words, this culture surrounds itself with meta-arguments that is either founded upon or embroidered by some or another meta-philosophy about what intellectuals are, what their role in the realm of ideas should be and how they should relate to the rest of society.\nOn the other hand, there is another intellectual tradition that thinks differently. It too has its own ideas about what knowledge is and thinks that building theories and hypotheses is the goal of all knowledge. As a result, it goes for the formulation of broad and sweeping hypotheses; the test of such hypotheses or theories becomes the goal of all discussions (how one tests it depends upon one’s own meta-conception of knowledge); logical and linguistic analyses becomes its stock-in-trade. Ambiguities are shunned, paradoxes are either solved or dissolved because their existence can count against a theory or hypothesis, and clarity, coherence, consistency, simplicity and such like are seen as the virtues of knowledge-claims. Because of its unremitting focus on knowledge, being a ‘public intellectual’ is not much of a concern for many, leaving that to the personal choice of individuals.\n","tags":[],"title":"Two kinds of research in social sciences","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/two-kinds-of-research-in-social-sciences/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","basics","explication"],"content":"There is a very interesting notion of \u0026ldquo;critique\u0026rdquo;: it begins with Kant and stretches through Marx in the German philosophical tradition.

It harks back to Kant\u0026rsquo;s use of the word in some senses, but is nowhere as developed as it was with Hegel\u0026rsquo;s pupils.\nThere is a third notion of critique that the French philosophers like Sartre used.

From the conversations so far, I presume that this is both your gut-feeling and conviction. The one deriving from your own mystical experience and the other because you find that mysticism, qua experience, does not distinguish between people on the basis of their color, creed, culture and country. I am perfectly willing to bow to authentic experience, but convictions? They need arguments and evidence, even if it is a subject as thorny as mystical experience. However, I will not ask you for your evidence but will try to present counter-evidence to your conviction.\nIn the first place, there were many messiahsduring the period Jesus was anointed as the Christ. All of them, including Jesus of Nazareth, were dismissed as false messiahs by the Judaic traditions of that period. After Jesus, other mystics within Christianity did not call themselves ‘the anointed’. That is to say, Jesus must have been limited by the way Judaic religion looked at the world and other worldly events.\nThe evangelists record Jesus as saying that he has ‘been sent unto the lost sheep of Israel’ and not for the ‘humankind’. (Matthew 10.6-7; 15.24) In other words, whatever his ‘vision’ (or ‘experience’), he did not see it as something applicable to the whole of humankind.\nHe did not, at least according to the evangelists, send his apostles except “unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel” and explicitly ‘forbade’ them to preach among the gentiles, i.e. non-Jews, and the Samaritans. (See also Matthew 10.6-7; Matthew 7.27, Matthew 7.6, Mark 7.27.) Of course, evangelists also ascribe other ‘more universal’ thoughts to Jesus Christ, but this is a problem for the Christian theologians, not for us.\nPoints 2 and 3 indicate that there is prima-facie plausibility to the claim that Jesus also saw himself as limited by the Judaic religion and its messianic expectation. That is to say, the teachings of Jesus is not only limited by the Jewish theology but that Jesus himself accepts this limitation.\nWhatever his experience or vision, we have three objective constraints posed on any ‘interpretation’ of Jesus: (a) the messianic trend; (b) the Judaic theological confinement; (c) Jesus’ own acceptation of these limitations and his explicit instructions to the apostles. (I will not take exception to the comparison Jesus makes between non-Jews and swine and so on.) What I would like to know is this: how could any experience (or any vision) confined by these parameters could even remotely be called mystical? Along what lines would you want to compare the Indian version of mysticism with that of Jesus so that both appear as mysticisms?\n","tags":[],"title":"Is Jesus a mystic?","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/is-jesus-a-mystic/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","Indian traditions","tolerance","vibrancy"],"content":"I would like to address a very basic issue that many of us have confronted. In its simplest form, the question is this: What should we, a small slice of the Indian intelligentsia, be doing? We can vent our anger and frustration at the way the Indian politicians are handling (or mishandling) the Kashmiri situation; we can express hurt and outrage that \u0026lsquo;Hindus\u0026rsquo; are singled out for special treatment both by the \u0026rsquo;liberals\u0026rsquo; and by a section of the Muslim population; we can propose a trifurcation of Kashmir; or that the Muslims be \u0026rsquo;taught\u0026rsquo; a lesson (whatever that lesson consists of); indulge in abuse and name-calling; or whatever else that takes our fancy at any particular moment.\nMy question is: does it help alleviate the situation, which drew forth such a response in the first place? Apart from providing a sense of \u0026lsquo;satisfaction\u0026rsquo; (?), which is extremely short lived, or earning a \u0026lsquo;reputation\u0026rsquo; on this Sulekha site, what else is achieved? My suspicion: pretty little else. The problem between Muslims and \u0026lsquo;Hindus\u0026rsquo; did not begin nor will it end in Kashmir: it is a centuries-old hurt (on both sides), which when left unaddressed properly for a long time turns into an all-consuming hate. Before such a hate consumes the other, it consumes the self first. Therefore, may I invite your kind thoughts on what a proper addressing should consist of by formulating the beginning of such an enquiry?\nMy formulation is tentative: feel free to shoot it down, but only under the condition that you will put a better alternative in its stead. Only then can a real dialogue grow between the many of us who want to do \u0026lsquo;something\u0026rsquo; about the situation but not \u0026lsquo;anything\u0026rsquo;. Let me begin by soliciting your agreement on the following: most of us belong to the Indian intelligentsia, even if all of us are not \u0026lsquo;intellectuals\u0026rsquo; in the sense of having made a profession of reading and writing articles and books. If this is the case, what should we, this slice of intelligentsia, be doing today? Of course, we can do many things: put pressure on the politicians, create public opinion, be very vocal, raise funds for the \u0026lsquo;cause\u0026rsquo; we hold to be just, etc. No doubt, each of these has its importance, but what should our primary focus be? Let me start the ball rolling by focusing on the long term goal first.\nI would like to draw your attention to what is obvious to most of us: the \u0026lsquo;pluralism\u0026rsquo; (let us make do with this word for the moment) of \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo;. We need not be detained by the question whether it is unique to \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; or not; it suffices to note that this \u0026lsquo;property\u0026rsquo; does not appear extrinsic to \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo;. What does this really mean? Even though different communities regularly clashed during the course of Indian history, it would be a miracle if people living together did not clash at all, no community was systematically persecuted by the other communities because the former worshipped some other \u0026lsquo;devathas\u0026rsquo; or followed its own \u0026lsquo;sampradaya\u0026rsquo;. (Of course, the Saivites and the Vaishnavites clashed regularly; the Advaitins fought the \u0026lsquo;Buddhists\u0026rsquo;; the Alwars denounced the Jains vigorously, etc. But, as far as I know, nowhere was some community persecuted so systematically as the Jews were in Europe, or the Baha’is in the Middle East, and so on.) In fact, the active pluralism of \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; consisted precisely of (a) vigorous clashes between different traditions on the one side and (b) the absence of systematic persecution despite such clashes on the other. There is another way of putting this: I want to propose that systematic persecution of some or another tradition did not take place precisely because of the vigorous clashes between the Indian traditions. That is to say, the active pluralism of \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; depends on the vigorous clashes between its traditions. (This is a bald claim, I know, but I merely promised to make a beginning.)\nWe also know that both Christianity and Islam, intolerant as they are, nevertheless \u0026lsquo;peacefully\u0026rsquo; coexisted with \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; in India for a long time. What enabled this extraordinary situation? Neither Islam nor Christianity has changed in its character since inception. So, how could they co-exist - some of their followers undergoing substantial metamorphoses in the process? (Just think of Christianity in Kerala or the Sufis in the north and south of India.) Here is the answer, which each of us knows as well: it is in the nature of \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; to thus influence other religions. In that case, why are we unable to further develop this aspect of \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo;? To blame it on international conspiracies (like that of the Roman Catholic Church), or to the rich oil kingdoms, or even Pakistan is to play the ostrich. The answer, however unpalatable it might be, must be faced by each one of us: \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; is obviously not so vigorous as it once was. Who are the culprits for this state of affairs? I am afraid the answer is in the mirror one looks at: oneself. We have failed in keeping \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; alive and vibrant; that is why we are afraid of being \u0026lsquo;swamped\u0026rsquo; by the Muslims or Christians or liberals or communists or whoever else. Surely, our forefathers (and I mean our distant forefathers) were neither worried nor afraid: they carried \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;Buddhism\u0026rsquo; throughout the vast continent that Asia is without being supported by huge temple funds, armies, kingdoms or merchant caravans. \u0026lsquo;Why did the Bodhi dharma come to the East?\u0026rsquo; asks a Zen koan. Why indeed? Whatever the reason, the point is that this Zen koan talks about an individual and does not ask \u0026lsquo;why did the Buddhist missionaries come to China?\u0026rsquo; What has happened to us, their descendants, that we have lost this strength and purity? Why do we hide behind invectives and abuses? What \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; have we been imbibed with that we have ended up jumping at shadows? We are worried about modernity and the role of English in the Indian society; we fear that the Church and the mosque will swallow us whole; we hate our \u0026lsquo;backwardness\u0026rsquo;, embarrassed at the orthodoxy of our parents and grand parents; look down upon \u0026rsquo;the caste system\u0026rsquo;; denigrate \u0026lsquo;archakas\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;poojaris\u0026rsquo; and Sanskrit in the same breath\u0026hellip; this list is virtually endless. (Please, I am not claiming that every one of us shares these \u0026lsquo;ills\u0026rsquo;. I am being, forgivably I hope, rhetorical.)\nIn other words, this is our first priority as the intelligentsia: to examine the nature of \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; that we have imbibed. I do not mean that we examine our conscience, for that would the wrong path to tread. It is not an individual failure, any more than it is a psychological question. Rather, it is a social ill that has befallen us, to which we need to seek a remedy. That remedy is to be found in our traditions, but to find it we need a diagnosis of our present situation.\nI have some idea of what the diagnosis is, and what the cure should be. Before shooting my mouth off any further, prudence suggests that I await your reactions, whether they be flame or flowers. Depending on them, we can continue this conversation.\nCheck the related post, legislations against proselytization demonstrate the weakness of Indian traditions.\nComments windwheel — 2014-04-05 06:11:00\nIn the case of Islam, my understanding is that a tension existed between those who considered Hindustan as \u0026lsquo;dar ul harb\u0026rsquo; and thus a place where a \u0026lsquo;farz e kifayya\u0026rsquo; (communally discharged duty) existed to wage jihad and convert or expel kaffirs, or if that was unsafe, then the duty became one of \u0026lsquo;hijrat\u0026rsquo; (emigration). However some Muslim theologians said Hindustan was a \u0026lsquo;dar ul suluh\u0026rsquo; and that if any danger to Islam existed then it came from Western Imperialism. However, the move towards representative govt.under the Raj meant that Politics became almost exclusively concerned with local elites monopolizing jobs and \u0026lsquo;rent seeking opportunities\u0026rsquo;. In that context both pragmatic politicians as well as \u0026lsquo;intellectuals\u0026rsquo; like Iqbal could come to see Islam as essentially a political ideology which, if implemented, would enable Muslims to come forward very rapidly and even establish a World wide Caliphate. The vibrancy of Political Islam has a lot to do with institutional support and international networks which receive official sanction and protection. By contrast, Hinduism- which could be considered a rebellion against narrow, Caste based, \u0026lsquo;vyavaharika\u0026rsquo; dharma- showed considerable vibrancy between 1880 and 1920 but was then lost momentum because of Khilafat and the false notion that India could only gain freedom by doing a deal with Political Islam. This wasn\u0026rsquo;t entirely Gandhi\u0026rsquo;s fault. The truth is, Motilal Nehru and C.R Das\u0026rsquo;s time wasting antics in the Legislative Council had the effect of continually giving concessions on the basis that by some magic the \u0026lsquo;high caste Hindus\u0026rsquo; would rule the roost and therefore it was right and proper that they should pay in advance for the power which would inevitably come to them. The truth is that dominant castes, whether \u0026lsquo;Hindu\u0026rsquo; or not, were determined to break the power of the old literary castes (not necessarily Brahmin, indeed the vast majority of Bhramins never belonged to such sub-castes in the first place) before the British left. In this game, some \u0026lsquo;high castes\u0026rsquo; got the big Offices but the price was by discriminating against their own kind. Yet, \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; remained necessary as a means of combating \u0026lsquo;vyavaharika dharma\u0026rsquo; and low social mobility based on internalized stereotypes. The truth is things like Sanskrit and learning Yoga etc, help poor kids from the dehat to get a leg up in life. Shyamji Krishnaverma wasn\u0026rsquo;t from an affluent family. He rose to become a Balliol graduate and Dewan because of his Sanskrit oratory for which he got the title Pundit from Benares. Lack of vibrancy in Hinduism has to do with Indian politicians treating their parent community as the one which must make concessions and pay all the bills so that they can themselves enjoy office. It also has to do with a type of officially sanctioned Judicial hermeneutics which considers Hinduism to be a sort of monstrous machine whose aim is to exploit and humiliate non Brahmins and perpetrate atrocities against women. This begs the question, what magic did the numerically tiny Brahmins possess to have imposed this fraud for so long? The truth is the Hindu epics themselves give a highly rational solution to this conundrum. Yuddhishtra in Mahabharata has to learn Statistical Game theory to overcome his Vishada and to rule as a Just King. The theory of \u0026lsquo;costly signals\u0026rsquo; vs \u0026lsquo;cheap talk\u0026rsquo; explains the puzzling aspects of vyavaharika dharma. It also gives the whole of Society a way of moving forward to better co-operative equilibria. People like Chief Justice Gajendragadkar, in the Thirties, pointed out that all the Smritis say \u0026lsquo;follow the example of the best people\u0026rsquo;- i.e. one can always change the vyahara prescription on the basis of time and place. However, at a later point, after Independence, seduced by American Legal positivism and substantive due process praxis, such Judges and intellectuals jumped on the \u0026lsquo;Hinduism is primitive sutpidity\u0026rsquo; bandwagon. Why? Hinduism is not vibrant among Indian \u0026lsquo;intellectuals\u0026rsquo; because it is not incentive compatible. It is individually rational for an office holder, or Magsaysay award winner, to pretend Hinduism is Hitlerism and that one is actually being very brave for denouncing it. The truth is very different. Still, if any foreigner happens to read this- let me quickly add- me Hindu man. Hindu they be very bad. Always worship snake and commit suttee and thugee on all and sundry.

Instead of quoting from their scriptures, let me give the barest of the bare outlines of their fundamental story about \u0026lsquo;God\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo;. Nobelieverfrom any of these religions (their religious authorities included) could ever disagree with this outline. There are two \u0026lsquo;Gods\u0026rsquo;: the true God and the false God (notice the capitalization). The first created the world and everything in it; the second, who is his creature too, is the \u0026lsquo;fallen\u0026rsquo; one. (Why he fell, what his \u0026lsquo;sin\u0026rsquo; was, etc. are glossed differently by these three religions.) The devil has many names (Baal, Beelzebub, Satan, Lucifer, Mephistopheles, \u0026hellip;) and his followers are \u0026ldquo;legion\u0026rdquo;. This devil is the lord of the earth, the prince of darkness, the father of lies, the king of deceit, etc. the devil is the \u0026lsquo;false god\u0026rsquo;, i.e., he constantly seduces mankind into worshipping him as though he was God himself. To worship the devil is to go to hell for eternity; the road to salvation (please, do not confuse this with mukthi or moksha) lies in worshipping the true God. However, how to know who is the true God so that one may worship him? What does it mean to \u0026lsquo;worship\u0026rsquo; him? (After all, so their story goes, the false God also parades as \u0026lsquo;God\u0026rsquo; and deceives the humankind.) Hence, God reveals himself (again, please do not confuse this with avataaras.), and tells that he is the true God and how humankind ought to worship him. (\u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo;, as they see it, is the worship of God.) This revelation is what their scriptures are about. According to these revelations, God has commanded not to build his likeness (i.e. create idols); to worship the idols is to worship the devil. This true God is one; the false \u0026lsquo;gods\u0026rsquo; are many (the devil\u0026rsquo;s \u0026rsquo;legion\u0026rsquo;); he has one name (Yahweh written without the consonants in Hebrew; the Holy Trinity in Christianity; the merciful Allah in Islam); the devil has many names. (Do not confuse names with the hundred and odd properties of God that Koran talks about. Now, these and more are God\u0026rsquo;s revelations in these three religions.\nWhen Muslims destroyed and defaced temples in India, or destroyed and defaced the churches in the Middle East, they were not being fanatics: they were carrying out the words of Allah (as conveyed through the prophet, of course). They are the literal words of (their) God Himself, not some fancy interpretation of this or that scholar or theologian. (The hatred between the Jews and Muslims in Palestine is not merely about territorial occupation and \u0026rsquo;terrorism\u0026rsquo;: it is deeper than that. The God of the Jews commanded the Jews to put all the gentiles - i.e. non-Jews - to the sword: the old, the women, and the children included. Read the Old Testament Bible to get some flavor of the Judaic religion.) When we Indians say the \u0026lsquo;God\u0026rsquo; has many names, these religions agree: They are the names of the \u0026lsquo;false God\u0026rsquo; (devil) and his minions. What we do is \u0026lsquo;idol worship\u0026rsquo;: one of the greatest sins which directly disobeys God\u0026rsquo;s word. Not only that. That is exactly how the devil is worshipped. That is why these religions are intolerant of each other, though not the way they are with respect to, say, \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo;. With respect to each other, they are \u0026lsquo;merely\u0026rsquo; heresies; they all worship the true god even though, in their eyes, each is deficient in their worship. But \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; is not a \u0026lsquo;heresy\u0026rsquo;: it is outright devil\u0026rsquo;s worship. (That is why it is a false religion: it worships the false \u0026lsquo;gods\u0026rsquo;, namely, the devil and his minions.) Therefore, their attitude is even more antagonistic towards us.\nYes, according to their \u0026lsquo;God\u0026rsquo;, our \u0026lsquo;gods\u0026rsquo; are either incarnations or the followers of the devil. The only way they can \u0026rsquo;tolerate\u0026rsquo; us is when they cease being \u0026lsquo;believers\u0026rsquo; themselves. However, as I said in my previous post, this does not make a believer from any of these three religions into a missionary or a persecutor. But we need to understand these three religions; if we do not, we are whistling in the dark.\nWith respect to \u0026rsquo;tolerance\u0026rsquo;, a word or two might prove useful to reflect about. The discussions about \u0026rsquo;tolerance\u0026rsquo; as we know them today, date from the religious conflicts in Europe: especially between the Protestants and the Catholics. Perhaps, you are insufficiently aware that this discussion was won by the Protestant religion in Europe. (\u0026lsquo;Tolerance\u0026rsquo; is a word that picks out the standpoint of the Protestants: no human being can mediate between God and man. The Catholics, by contrast, claimed that the Church mediated between man and God because the Church was the body and bride of Christ. The Catholics held that the Church decided about what proper faith was; the Protestants held that the Holy Spirit inspires Christians in interpreting the message of God, i.e. the Bible, without the mediation of the Church, etc.) \u0026lsquo;Tolerance\u0026rsquo; is not some \u0026lsquo;secular\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;philosophical\u0026rsquo; doctrine, but a belief of the Protestant religion. That is why even in Europe, it worked only once: when the Protestants won the religious battle. (Look at Ireland: the Protestant doctrine does not work even there because they confront an intransigent Catholic population.) So, may I beg of you not to yield to the Universalist pretention of the Protestant religion (i.e. that it is \u0026rsquo;the best\u0026rsquo; and \u0026rsquo;the only\u0026rsquo; true religion of the humankind)? The discussion is utterly senseless in the Indian context (it is so even in the current European context); so do not let yourself be seduced by the Protestant jargon. While I am perfectly willing to allow a protestant to believe that his/hers is the true religion, I refuse to allow him/her to frame a debate about \u0026rsquo;the Hindus’ and the Muslims in India within the framework of Protestant theology. Perhaps, you too can extend the same courtesy to your religion (if you are a Muslim) and to your culture. What do you say?\nComments windwheel — 2014-03-30 05:17:00\nReading your recent posts, it appears that you think there some universal, simple, deontic logic such that knowledge of the \u0026lsquo;core\u0026rsquo; dogma of a sect enables an algorithmic derivation of everything it enjoins. As a matter of fact, not speculation, this isn\u0026rsquo;t true. Orthodox (haredi) Judaism has a concept of \u0026lsquo;halachah vein morin kein\u0026rsquo; such that dogmatic Knowledge of the Law forbids the very action it otherwise enjoins. The context is the slaying of Zimri \u0026amp; Kosbi by the zealot Pinchas. In other words, the action that dogma approves (because it is clearly laid down in Scripture)- viz. slaughtering the \u0026lsquo;Devil worshiping\u0026rsquo; infidel- is forbidden precisely because it is known. Islam, similarly, has similar workarounds- either involving the pragmatics of farz e kifayya or else by distinguishing insha and khabar in the context of alam al amr and alam al khalq- while, even with Western Christianity there\u0026rsquo;s distinctions between things like synteresis and conscientia such that a gap is created between Dogmatic beliefs and what is deontically enjoined. Turning to our own Region, we don\u0026rsquo;t find Zoroastrians and Hindus killing each other though the former consider our \u0026lsquo;devas\u0026rsquo; to be devils while we tend to think of their Ahura as a demonic Asura. No doubt, from time to time some theologically inclined King- like Ashoka- slaughtered sramans of rival sects but this was supererogatory and is generally explained (as is the incarnations of Devas slaughtering Asuras) in terms of Karmic moral economy involving Samrambha Yoga or Virodha Bhakti or something of that sort. Like my ancestors, I think our Sectarian polemics (Anantanarayanan has given a hilarious account of a debate between a Saivite and a Vaishnavite in his short novel \u0026lsquo;Silver pilgrimage\u0026rsquo;) to be delightfully silly, but, like my ancestors, though supposedly bound by one particular dogma, I am happy to go for darshan of any Shraman/Bhraman Acharya and to visit Swami Narayan Temple, or go to Arya Samaji havan or Kabir panthi or Narayana Guru kirtan or whatever. Of course, I must mention that as a strict Smarta, I am currently looking for a hitman to kill my cousins so that I can inherit the family property. I would like to remind any Muslim or Christian or Jewish persons who follows this blog that, because it is your Religious duty to kill Hindus, you should charge me the lowest possible rate. Incidentally, my cousins are putting not just tomato but also onion in their sambar. This clearly shows they are acharabrashta and deserving of death. Mind it kindly. Jai Hind. Har Har Modi Deva.\n","tags":[],"title":"Theology of Tolerance","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/theology-of-tolerance/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","Christianity","God, Satan(Devil)","tolerance"],"content":"There are two distinct problems: one involving religions (like Christianity, Judaism and Islam) and the other involving the believers.\nRegarding these three religions: (a) insofar as these religions (Judaism, Christianity and Islam) are concerned, Hinduism is demonic. It is that because, according to all the three religions, \u0026lsquo;Hindus\u0026rsquo; worship the devil (\u0026lsquo;shaitan\u0026rsquo;) and his minions. That is to say, our Rama, Vishnu, Ganesha, Saraswathi, etc. are all lieutenants of the devil himself. The idols, according to their theology, are representations of the devil, and Pat Robertson is simply echoing this standard Christian (Judaic, and Islamic) doctrines. There is nothing \u0026rsquo;extremist\u0026rsquo; about this statement: it is, as I say, one of the basic claims of these three religions. Because we worship the devil, they are convinced, we will all go to hell (do not confuse this with our naraka) for eternity. Because they want to save souls, these religions want to convert others into \u0026lsquo;believers\u0026rsquo;. (By the way, the \u0026lsquo;jealous\u0026rsquo; God is God of the Jews - God of Israel - in one of the more known aspects from the Old Testament Bible. In the New Testament, God is supposed to be \u0026rsquo;loving\u0026rsquo;. If you want to irk a Jew just tell him that his God is jealous and punishing, whereas God of Christianity is loving.)\n(b) It is in virtue of this that these three religions are intolerant: of each other and of \u0026lsquo;heathen\u0026rsquo; religions.(\u0026rsquo;the heathen\u0026rsquo; and \u0026rsquo;the pagan\u0026rsquo;, irrespective of their etymological origins, signify, in the theologies of these three religions, one who worships the devil.)\n(c) In fact, this intolerance is what makes them into the religions they are. To speak of a \u0026rsquo;tolerant Judaism\u0026rsquo;, or a \u0026rsquo;tolerant Christianity\u0026rsquo; or a \u0026rsquo;tolerant Islam\u0026rsquo; is contradictio in terminis.\n(d) The ferocious attack the Christian missionaries launched against \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; and \u0026rsquo;the caste system\u0026rsquo;; the militant and forced conversion of \u0026lsquo;hindus\u0026rsquo; into Islam are merely exemplifications of such a theological attitude.\nRegarding the believers: (a) from this, it does not follow, either as a matter of logic or of psychology, that every believing Jew, Christian or a Muslim is either a missionary or a persecutor.\n(b) With respect to India, it does not follow as a matter of history either. The Kerala Christians (most of whom belong to the eastern Christian churches) and their relation to the Kerala Muslims and the Kerala \u0026lsquo;Hindus\u0026rsquo;; the emergence of the \u0026lsquo;Sufi\u0026rsquo; tradition in the north, its transmutation into a variety of bhakti tradition in Bijapur and further south; these two indicate another course that the believers took as well.\n(c) Today, in the big cities of India in any case, Muslims are increasingly those who are followers of theological Islam. (Of course, even the \u0026lsquo;flexible\u0026rsquo; Islam that one knew during a specific period in the Indian history came about when the theological hold got loosened over the monarchs and their kingdoms.)\n(d) Be it as that may, it appears to me to use the same brush (and breath) to sketch the profiles of both believers and their religions would not only distort logic, psychology, and history but, more importantly, provide us with little understanding.\n","tags":[],"title":"Religious Intolerance and Believers","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/believers-vs-their-religion/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","Christianity","God, Satan(Devil)","tolerance"],"content":"Here goes: that \u0026lsquo;Hindu\u0026rsquo; religion is devil\u0026rsquo;s worship is central, crucial and vital to the religions that Judaism, Christianity and Islam are. \u0026lsquo;Why is that?\u0026rsquo;, you may ask. It is impossible to cover this question in the space of a post, and with the details the question demands. So, here is what can be done: (a) I will provide a very crude outline with respect to Christianity; (b) reread what I wrote about God and devil .\nChristian religion claims that Jesus of Nazareth (a human being) is the Christ. (\u0026lsquo;Christ\u0026rsquo; means \u0026rsquo;the promised one\u0026rsquo; or \u0026rsquo;the messiah\u0026rsquo;, \u0026rsquo;the anointed\u0026rsquo;; it is not the family name of Jesus.) Who promised what to whom do you think? According to both the Judaic religion and Christianity, God promised to deliver the \u0026lsquo;people of Israel\u0026rsquo;, under certain conditions, by sending someone (a messenger) down to earth to lead the people of Israel. How to recognize coming of the messiah? According to these two religions, God also would send \u0026lsquo;signs\u0026rsquo; which the human beings could interpret.\nJesus of Nazareth was proclaimed as this \u0026lsquo;promised one\u0026rsquo; (i.e. as the Christ) by the Christians. The Jews, who are still waiting for the messiah to come, considered him as \u0026rsquo;the false messiah\u0026rsquo; and not the true one that God has promised. But the early Christians used the \u0026lsquo;book of Daniel\u0026rsquo; (from the Old Testament Bible) to \u0026lsquo;prove\u0026rsquo; that Jesus was also the Christ. (That is, they claimed that the divine signs, which should help human beings in recognizing the coming of Christ, were fulfilled. For this purpose, they used the book of Daniel.) The Jews refused to accept this claim.\nThe Christians claimed that God would deliver all humankind, if they followed the path and teachings of Christ (\u0026rsquo;the gospel\u0026rsquo; means the life and teachings of Christ) and that this was the only path to salvation. All other paths led to hell, and they are the lures that the devil has set up.\nTo proselytize means to spread God\u0026rsquo;s word. Do you know what that word is? That the messiah has come; He, the only son of God, died for our sins; and that, on the third day, He was resurrected. and that those who follow the path, and only those who follow this path, have any chance of salvation.\nBeing \u0026lsquo;saved\u0026rsquo; means being saved from the clutches of the devil - i.e. from eternal damnation. You are not \u0026lsquo;saved\u0026rsquo; because you are a moral person and an ethical being: you will be saved if, and only if, you follow Christ. (That is why, after all, the messiah came down to earth: to save our souls from the devil.)\nThe Christians are called \u0026lsquo;Christians\u0026rsquo; because they believe that Jesus of Nazareth is the Christ, i.e. the messiah came to earth some two thousand years ago, died for our sins, etc. A Buddha, a Shankara, for example, will go straight to hell, stay there for eternity because their \u0026lsquo;souls\u0026rsquo; are not saved from the clutches of the devil.\nThe Jews are doomed, according to Christians, because they refuse to recognize that the messiah has already come. According to the Jews, Jesus is not the Christ, but a false messiah.\nTo summarize in slightly abstract terms: one worships the true God (this is what true religion is) so that one might be saved from the clutches of the false god (i.e. the devil). So, you see, opposition to the devil and his worship are absolutely crucial to Christianity; the true religion is defined against the false religion, just as the false god is defined against the true God.\nSo, according to them, humankind has only two choices: either go to hell for eternity, or hope that it can be saved from the clutches of the devil. This hope is the realization that God, in His infinite mercy, sent down his only son to lead us away from the devil and his worship. So, if you want to save your soul from the devil (God has given humankind the \u0026lsquo;freedom\u0026rsquo; to choose between God and devil), you need to follow the Christ. Otherwise, you have chosen to follow the devil and earned a one way ticket to an eternal residence in hell.\nDo you see now, why \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; is necessarily the worship of the devil and why such a claim is crucial and central to Christianity? Mutatis mutandis, this story applies to Judaism and Islam equally.\nPlease keep in mind that I have given a crude outline only. This, however, does not mean that I have distorted their story. It merely means that I have not done justice to the subtlety and richness of their theologies. Regrettable, but unavoidable.\nThis should tell also why formulating their hostility towards \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; or our responses to them in terms of \u0026rsquo;tolerance\u0026rsquo; is hopelessly inadequate. This term is useful if you are talking about \u0026lsquo;heresies\u0026rsquo; (i.e. differing accents and claims based on a core of commonly accepted theological beliefs); not when the issue is between the true religion and the false religions. (Take this bald claim for what it is worth: there is no space to argue this out in this context.)\nComments E.Roshan — 2015-06-12 10:59:19\nYou are correct, Hindus worship devils. Jesus Christ is the son of God, God is in three state, that is Father, Son and the Holy spirit, It is like water, Water also takes three states that is Solid- Ice, Liquid- Water and Air. Islam\u0026rsquo;s Quran is the copy and paste of Old testament of the Bible. there is no doubt that Hindus worship Devil. Buddha is not God, he was a good person, and he worshiped Devils that is Hinduism. Judaism, they pray only to the Father like Muslims Hence, Christianity is the True Religion with no Doubt. We can discuss further, please contact me.\nAmrita — 2015-11-22 17:45:37\nE Roshan you are the devil.\nJames — 2016-02-19 21:46:05\nYou are begging the question.

Hinduism is Satanic to it\u0026rsquo;s core. Their gods resemble with the Satanic Hermaphrodite and those who believe that Hinduism is the e religion of peace, they are falling to Satan.\nMrinal barla — 2017-04-18 18:19:51\nYes you are off course right,in movie when someone worship Hindu god,and when shown that Hindu god save,they are very proudly,who worship is also very proudy,by this we can seen satanic attitude,satanic character,satanic word,they said,there lord come to destroy sinner,since we already know satan work is destroy,but GOD plan is to save sinner,this completely indicate they are satanic,so be careful from other religion,.\nLate — 2016-09-20 07:02:39\nAgreed. Although the Vatican has tampered with even the original gospel as well. You\u0026rsquo;re supposed to walk in the spirit and live a lifestyle not of the flesh, but the whole thing has been distorted so much over the passed 2,000 years that we can\u0026rsquo;t really say what truth is until the Messiah arrives.\nThe fact alone that so many follow these religions prove them false.\nPart of the doctrine may be true, but not with evil running the world.\nMatthew 7:13-14 13 Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat:\n14 Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.\nklaus — 2016-12-16 05:58:16\nHey guys why do you think that Hinduism is the worship of devil.I mean if Christianity is the only way to forgiveness than why boast about it and why criticize Hinduism.As a Hindu one is bound by certain principles and those work and give one the satisfaction that he is in this world for a reason and he should fulfill his responsibilities.They respect other religion as they are taught to do so and and they don\u0026rsquo;t about babbling their religion that it\u0026rsquo;s the only one to follow. So, to say Hinduism is the worship of devil is way out of line.Hope you give it a thinking.\nDonald Matthews — 2017-02-10 00:26:25\nThere is nothing to respect when it comes to hinduism..Demon Worshipers..well we should respect people even if they are hindus but cant really say the same about a pagan worshiping religion aye.\nVarun Nigam — 2017-02-17 07:41:17\nThere is nothing fruitful in discussing superior Hindu faith( philosophically, intellectually, Morally, scientifically superior) with Abhrahmic Morons. They still believe the world to be 10000 years old. But now with concrete scientific evidence it has been proven world to be billions of years old as described in Hindu, Jain and Buddhist texts. Let them believe in Jew Zombie who would deliver them from eternal hell if they eat his flesh and drink his blood. This act will absolve them from sins committed by Rib women who ate fruit of knowledge after being persuaded by a speaking snake. The utterly foolish myth with even worse philosophy will lead its followers to eternal cycle of birth in lower form of life and suffering. May wrath of Bhairav burn these fanatics loonies in eternal fire of ignorance and suffering.\nThyan Challam — 2017-04-03 03:14:33\nI am sure that the author of this article means well but it is evident that the author has very little understanding of both Judaism and Christianity. He makes many assumptions, some of which may deceive the naive. I will list out some of the author\u0026rsquo;s obvious misconceptions.\nFirst, the author claims that Jesus of Nazareth was a human being. Orthodox Christianity attests to this as fact, that he truly was man. However, Orthodox Christianity also attests to his Godhood. In other words, since he was born of a woman he was human but because he was born of the will of God and not of the flesh he was God incarnate - \u0026ldquo;Immanuel\u0026rdquo;(which means \u0026ldquo;God with us\u0026rdquo;). He was 100% man and 100% God.\nSecond, the early Christians, as do Christians of the current age, do not only use just the Book of Daniel as a validation of Jesus Christ being the Promised Messiah. Jesus fulfills more than 44 different prophecies in the Old Testament. The list of the prophecies that Jesus has fulfilled (prophecies from the Old Testament) and their New Testament fulfillment are well documented here https://www.thoughtco.com/prophecies-of-jesus-fulfilled-700159. I urge the seeker of truth to follow the link. A sample of some of them are given below -\nMessiah would be born of a woman.\tGenesis 3:15 Messiah would be born in Bethlehem.\tMicah 5:2 Messiah would be born of a virgin.\tIsaiah 7:14 Messiah would come from the line of Abraham.\tGenesis 12:3 Genesis 22:18 Messiah would be a descendant of Isaac.\tGenesis 17:19 Genesis 21:12 Messiah would be a descendant of Jacob.\tNumbers 24:17\tMatthew 1:2 Messiah would come from the tribe of Judah.\tGenesis 49:10 Messiah would be heir to King David\u0026rsquo;s throne.\t2 Samuel 7:12-13 Isaiah 9:7 Messiah\u0026rsquo;s throne will be anointed and eternal.\tPsalm 45:6-7 Daniel 2:44 Messiah would be called Immanuel.\tIsaiah 7:14 Third, the word Gospel does not mean mean \u0026ldquo;the life and teachings of Christ\u0026rdquo; rather it means \u0026ldquo;Good News\u0026rdquo;. The concept of the good news can only be understood in the light the \u0026ldquo;bad news\u0026rdquo;. The bad news began in the garden of Eden. When Adam and Eve sinned against God, by disobeying Him, they were expelled from His presence. This was because God is Holy and without sin and therefore cannot tolerate sin. This is sometimes known as \u0026ldquo;the fall\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;the fall of man\u0026rdquo;. With the fall, sin entered the world, and with it came disease, decay and death. The Biblical concept of sin is that \u0026ldquo;the soul that sins shall die\u0026rdquo; - Ezekiel 18:20. Since every human has descended from the first parents, the nature of sin, and the death that accompanies it, is ultimately inherited by every human being. In order for man to be reconciled with God, a sacrifice must be made. In the past the Jews would sacrifice goats, lambs, bulls, doves and other livestock to be reconciled with God. God then sends Jesus (his only Begotten son) to become the ultimate sacrifice. Since Jesus was without sin his blood would appease the wrath of God forever so that whosoever believes in Jesus would have eternal life and not the second death in hell. This promise of eternal life is conditional. The condition is that he who wishes to save his life must die to the old life and be born again is life through Jesus Christ. This is why Christians baptise, as a symbol of being dead to the old life and being born again to the new life in Christ. This is why Jesus said \u0026ldquo;I am the Way, the Truth and the Life. No one comes to the Father but through me.\u0026rdquo; There is no other way to salvation but through Jesus Christ, the son of the Most High God.\nFourth, the author assumes that Jesus Christ came to teach a new religion - i.e., a new way to worship God, a new way to perform rites and rituals, a whole new set of mantras and pujas. Unfortunately, some so-called Christians have made it religion. Jesus Christ did not come to burden man with the burdens of religion. He came to set man free from himself, from his sins. He points the way to the One True God, the God who is ready to sacrifice himself for his children so that they may have life and have it abundantly. Christianity is not a religion based on a set of laws and rules that one must follow, it is a lifestyle based on following the son of God, Jesus Christ who was obedient even unto death, even a shameful death on a cross. If all Christians, including myself, were to follow all that Jesus taught we would not need to preach the Gospel our lives would do the preaching.\nThe author of the article writes that he only means to offer a crude outline of Christianity and does not mean to distort Christianity, while I appreciate his intent, I am obliged to point out that the most important parts of the Christian message have been filtered out. Questions such as \u0026quot; Why should we go to Hell?\u0026quot;, \u0026ldquo;Why did Jesus have to die on a cross?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Why the big fuss over sin?\u0026rdquo; have all been left out. Jesus never said that if you are a Hindu or a Muslim or a Buddhist you would go to hell but he did say that those who disbelieve in him (some Christians disbelieve too) will be judged guilty. Christ said, “For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that everyone who believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through Him. Whoever believes in Him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe is already condemned, because he has not believed in the name of God’s one and only Son” (John 3:17).\nאבא — 2017-04-09 11:24:57\nBelieve in true abrahamic faith.

At random, here is how Martin Luther talks about the difference between the two: \u0026ldquo;observe, there are two ways of believing. In the first place I may have faith concerning God. This is the case when I hold to be true what is said concerning God. Such faith is on the same level with the assent I give to statements concerning the Turk, the Devil and Hell. A faith of this kind should be called knowledge or information rather than faith. In the second place there is faith in God. Such a faith is mine when I not only hold to be true what is said concerning God, but when I put my trust in Him in such a way as to enter into personal relations with Him, believing firmly that I shall find Him to be and to do as I have been taught\u0026hellip; the word in is well chosen and deserving of due attention.

The problems are far more complex and the task is far more daunting than they appear at first sight.\nWhat may not be forgotten, if one wants to be relevant and rational at all, is that we live in a world which has not merely included colonialisms but also our responses to them. Our generation is molded (mostly) by a colonial past that has basically been accessed only through its critique: whether nationalist, Marxist or Orientalist. Consequently, our questions, problems and misgivings are not those of a generation or two ago.\nWhile true that our relation to our own intellectual traditions is \u0026lsquo;problematic\u0026rsquo;, it is not clear what the nature of this problem is.

We have our share of intelligent men and women who have had their feet both in the Western and the Indian culture; but we have hardly produced social theories of any merit and value, have we? We have had (and continue to have) more than our share of nationalist, Marxist and Orientalist \u0026rsquo;thinkers\u0026rsquo;, who reproduce the time-worn critiques of the Western culture; but it has not made a whit of a difference to our intellectual traditions, has it? Surely, if the problem was \u0026lsquo;merely\u0026rsquo; one of how we are related (or \u0026lsquo;mediated\u0026rsquo;) to our cultural traditions, it would have been solved by any of the above groups. Not only have they failed; we are still in the dark about what bugs us about this state of affairs. A kind of \u0026lsquo;back to the roots\u0026rsquo; movement is just as silly today as the routine of the brown saheb and his \u0026lsquo;butler-english\u0026rsquo;.\nNeither D.D. Kosambi nor Romila Thapar was able to specify what our problems are; it is important to realize that neither Ronald Inden nor Partha Chatterjee do. How then could a Patanjali or the Buddha or a Shankara be relevant to us? It might help one in a vague way to discover that Patanjali had devised a meta-language or that we were well on our way to discover a predicate calculus some four thousand years before the west discovered it. How do such realizations help us today in finding out what we have to do? It may be a fancy thing in the USA (I live in Europe, so I do not really know) to speak of a Said or a Derrida or speak in the language of \u0026lsquo;post-colonial identity politics\u0026rsquo;. But please: this is how some Indians make a living in the USA, and it is even less relevant than what the Buddha said about \u0026lsquo;atman\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;anatman\u0026rsquo;.\nWe reproduce both our bondage (to the West) and our obliviousness to that bondage, whenever we reproduce the so-called social \u0026lsquo;sciences\u0026rsquo;(of, say, a Weber) or their critiques (of, say, an Inden).\nI do not want to put down Malhotra in any way. But what we need is not another \u0026lsquo;attempt\u0026rsquo; to generate an \u0026lsquo;Indian Renaissance\u0026rsquo;. What we need to do, if I may put it in the form of a slogan, is \u0026lsquo;decolonize the social sciences\u0026rsquo;; but that is a task of an entirely different magnitude.\nThe first prerequisite to do this is to give up the complacent and smug belief (that many a Sulekha reader shares with many more) that we know and understand the western culture and that all we need is to understand ours better. We know very little about either the West or its culture. Let us try and describe the west as it appears to us, against the background of our culture, without reproducing the theories and descriptions of the western intellectuals. Very soon, we will discover that we know pretty little about this culture as well: and that our ignorance here is every bit profound and deep as is our ignorance of our own culture.\nIn a way, what amazes me both about the article of Malhotra and those of its readers is this: how easily they assume that they know or understand the Western culture! If there is a single, pernicious impact that colonialism has had upon us (and there are many), it is to make us believe that we \u0026lsquo;know\u0026rsquo; the West. The truth is, we do not.\nOnly then could we relate fruitfully and productively to our own traditions. Until such an intellectual effort is made to understand the western culture, our attempts at addressing ourselves to the theme that Malhotra wants to talk about is a waste of time\nRead the follow up, \u0026ldquo;Why study the Western culture?\u0026rdquo;\nComments Rd — 2014-03-25 10:39:00\nThere is a typo here, i think: \u0026ldquo;problems and misgivings are not those of a generation of two ago\u0026rdquo;!\nDocWhiteCloud — 2014-03-25 19:45:00\nCorrected.\n","tags":[],"title":"Vacuity of Intellectual Svaraj","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/vacuity-of-intellectual-svaraj/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","Westology","explication"],"content":"What is the logic of my argument? Am I proposing a \u0026lsquo;westology\u0026rsquo;? Let me briefly explicate my stances, beginning with the last question.\nIf we are not to simply sell slogans and our claims should carry bite, we need to say what this \u0026lsquo;westology\u0026rsquo; is or could be. My stance: such a \u0026lsquo;westology\u0026rsquo; cannot even be properly conceptualized, let alone carried out. 1.1. What does it mean (however intuitively plausible it might appear at first sight) to build a \u0026lsquo;westology\u0026rsquo; that is, say, an Indian counterpart to \u0026lsquo;indology\u0026rsquo;? Are we to assume that we need to build Indian theories of \u0026lsquo;democracy\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;state\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;market\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;firm\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;society\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo; and such like? If the answer is \u0026rsquo;no\u0026rsquo;, then the notion of \u0026lsquo;westology\u0026rsquo; does not make sense. Therefore, the answer has to be \u0026lsquo;yes\u0026rsquo;.\n1.2. Assume, counterfactually, that Indians do author theories on these themes. (In fact, many Indians have written books on these subjects.) Question: what makes them Indian theories and not merely theories authored by Indians? Is Amartya Sen\u0026rsquo;s economic writings Indian theory of economics or a contribution to welfare economics? Is Sen doing \u0026lsquo;westology\u0026rsquo;, or doing economics?\n1.3. What, for instance, would make a theory of ethics or religion into a \u0026lsquo;westological\u0026rsquo; one? Surely, not because it will be about the west. What then? That we use the word \u0026lsquo;dharma\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;sampradaya\u0026rsquo;? This is not enough, for the obvious reason that there is no way we can even begin to use native concepts from the Indian traditions to speak of \u0026lsquo;ought\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;moral dilemma\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;is-ought\u0026rsquo; distinction and such like. (These are merely the simplest of the terms in the western ethical theories.) Why? Because these notions do not form a part of the Indian ethical traditions. What does it mean to speak of an \u0026lsquo;Indian perspective\u0026rsquo; on theology, eschatology, Eucharist, sin, salvation and such like?\n1.4. The \u0026lsquo;indologists\u0026rsquo; have built many theories of \u0026lsquo;caste\u0026rsquo;; written tracts about the Indian \u0026lsquo;religions\u0026rsquo;; about our \u0026rsquo;traditions\u0026rsquo; and marriage ceremonies. True, there are more Indians in the west than the other way round. But I have yet to see \u0026lsquo;westological\u0026rsquo; theories coming out.\nI am not denigrating or being polemical. I am merely saying that \u0026lsquo;westology\u0026rsquo; sounds fine because it is a \u0026lsquo;slogan\u0026rsquo; and no more than that. This notion has not been thought through. If one does the attempt, one will see that it is quite simply an idle dream.\nFurther, I am not willing to accept that \u0026lsquo;Indology\u0026rsquo; is a \u0026lsquo;study\u0026rsquo; of Indian people or their culture. It merely records the experience of the west. In its arrogance, the western culture claims that it is a description of Indian society and culture; in our foolishness, we accept such claims as true. Consequently, no, I am not advocating a \u0026lsquo;westology\u0026rsquo;.\nWhat is the logic of my argument? I think that Malhotra\u0026rsquo;s concerns are eminently reasonable and praiseworthy. But the way to intellectual \u0026lsquo;svaraj\u0026rsquo; will not (and cannot) take the path Malhotra outlines. Not just that. I claim that we have been through that path and that it is a cul-de-sac. Walking it is counter-productive. My post was meant to draw attention to this point.\nIt is possible that my point is an experiential lesson. In that case, one will have to retread these paths oneself to discover the truth of my point. In much the same way \u0026lsquo;atma-vidya\u0026rsquo; requires that the learner discovers things experientially, it might be the case that Malhotra has to go through this phase as well. (I have so far spent twenty years full-time on this path myself. Malhotra has another thirteen years to go then.)\nFor more, check the chapter \u0026ldquo;Comparative science of cultures\u0026rdquo; in Reconceptualizing India studies.\n","tags":["Rajiv Malhotra"],"title":"Westology and its nonsense","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/westology-and-its-nonsense/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","colonial consciousness","Hinduism","puja","symbolism","worship"],"content":"Two substantial questions have been raised in response to what I wrote: (a) why do we need to study and understand the Western culture in order to access our own traditions? (b) Is it my claim that Buddha and Shankara (for example) are irrelevant to us? One other sort of \u0026lsquo;objection\u0026rsquo; too has surfaced, albeit disguised as a characterization of what I have said: (c) is not my position itself illustrative of \u0026lsquo;Eurocentrism\u0026rsquo;? These issues are intertwined. Hopefully, addressing them together will lend some clarity.\nThe first thing to keep in mind about our own intellectual development (historically speaking) is that most of what we have learnt about ourselves has been the result of what has been said about us by the Western culture. That is to say, we relate to our own traditions and our own cultures the way the West has understood them. A few examples to illustrate what I mean. 1.1. We have learnt that \u0026lsquo;puja\u0026rsquo; means worship; \u0026lsquo;devas\u0026rsquo; are \u0026lsquo;gods\u0026rsquo;; \u0026lsquo;atman\u0026rsquo; is \u0026lsquo;self\u0026rsquo; (not to be confused with the empirical \u0026lsquo;self\u0026rsquo;); Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Saivism, etc. are \u0026lsquo;religions\u0026rsquo;; \u0026lsquo;sadhus\u0026rsquo; are our \u0026lsquo;holy\u0026rsquo; men; \u0026rsquo;tapas\u0026rsquo; is doing \u0026lsquo;penance\u0026rsquo;\u0026hellip; This list is virtually endless.\n1.2. As we grow up and discover that there is \u0026lsquo;ayudha puja\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;gopuja\u0026rsquo; and \u0026rsquo;lingapuja\u0026rsquo; either we are embarassed to discover their English equivalents or insist that we do not really worship any of these objects like the instruments, cows or the phallus. As Malhotra says, of course, we are not \u0026lsquo;phallic\u0026rsquo; worshippers because, we say, \u0026rsquo;lingam\u0026rsquo; is not \u0026lsquo;really\u0026rsquo; the phallus but \u0026hellip; but what? We routinely translate \u0026lsquo;idolatry\u0026rsquo; as \u0026lsquo;murthipuja\u0026rsquo; but insist that people do not really worship these images but merely \u0026hellip; merely what? The idea that one does not worship these \u0026lsquo;images\u0026rsquo; but looks at them \u0026lsquo;symbolically\u0026rsquo; is an an argument that the Catholic Pope Gregorius launched about 1000 years ago. (We think we are being \u0026lsquo;clever\u0026rsquo; when we reinvent the wheel.)\n1.3. What are our people doing when they do \u0026lsquo;puja\u0026rsquo;? Are they worshipping or not? If not, what else are they doing when they do \u0026lsquo;puja\u0026rsquo;?\nThe point I want to make is this: most of us have learnt English through the mediation of our local languages and the equivalences are not established by us because we know what \u0026lsquo;worship\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;God\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo; etc mean, but because we have been taught that they are equivalents. This is not a mere question of translation, that is, one of finding the \u0026lsquo;right\u0026rsquo; words (from our languages) to translate English (or any other European language). Rather it is one of understanding what these English words mean: not by consulting Oxford English Dictionary but by understanding what religion is, according to the Western intellectual and cultural traditions. To do this is to study and (partially) understand the Western culture.\nWhy do we need to do this at all? Why not simply use only our \u0026lsquo;words\u0026rsquo; and be done with it? Apart from any number of other reasons, consider one of the ideas that has surfaced and resurfaced again and again in these discussions: \u0026lsquo;hindutva\u0026rsquo;, BJP and \u0026lsquo;hindu fundamentalism\u0026rsquo;. These issues preoccupy the Indian intellectuals and the Indian polity. We simply \u0026lsquo;assume\u0026rsquo; that Hinduism exists; that it is some kind of a \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo;; and that we too have \u0026lsquo;fundamentalists\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;secularists\u0026rsquo;, etc. Here are my simple counter-questions: does \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; exist? If it does, is it a \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo;? What is \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo; so that we may say we \u0026rsquo;too\u0026rsquo; have it? These are not issues about definitions but those that invite a serious scientific investigation.\nIf people find these questions ridiculous or insulting, my point is proved: we simply assume answers to them; we might even find, perhaps, that raising them is vaguely offensive. And the point is this: these were the answers that (basically) the Western culture gave about us in their attempts to understand a culture different from their own.\nIn short, we do not have accessto our own traditions in any direct fashion. We rely upon an understanding that is determined by the Western understanding of our traditions. (Take a look at the Indian philosophical writing of the previous century to understand how deep this influence is.) At the same time, we do not have an understanding of the Western culture either, except what they have said about themselves. (Reflect a bit on my \u0026lsquo;counter-questions\u0026rsquo;.) How much of what we know about ourselves is due to our culture and how much of it is an ill-understood reproduction of the claims of the Western culture about us?\nThat is why I said, we need to study and understand the Western culture. This is not \u0026lsquo;Eurocentrism\u0026rsquo;, in any sense of the term. We need to do it, I said as well, against the background of our own culture. How does the West appear to us? How do we appear to ourselves? These two questions are deceptively simple in their appearance. Simple, they certainly are not.\nWe desperately need to understand the Western culture, not by parroting what its intellectuals have said about it but by studying it. We need to do this because our relation to ourselves and our past is determined by what they have said about both.\nAre Shankara and the Buddha \u0026lsquo;irrelevant\u0026rsquo; to us today? I have already touched on one of the presumptions: that weknow what they say. This is a demonstrably false presumption; we \u0026lsquo;know\u0026rsquo; what the \u0026lsquo;indologists\u0026rsquo; have told us about them. However, there is another answer I want to touch upon.\nThis question cannot be cognitively answered today. Their questions, whatever they might have been, are not ours; hence their answers cannot be ours either. (Unless we were to make the assumption that their questions and answers are \u0026rsquo;eternal\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;universally valid\u0026rsquo;.) What we need to do is to formulate our questions first and then see whether their queries and solutions help us in our quest. If they help us, they are relevant; if they do not, they are irrelevant. It might be the case that they \u0026lsquo;help\u0026rsquo; someone living the USA today. I do not doubt this: the gita, the Buddha or the Shankara comfort me and bring solace in my dark moments as well. But this is not the issue. The issue is: why do they do so? How to understand, to give but one example, that the world is \u0026lsquo;maya\u0026rsquo; or illusion? Am I to say that the world described by the natural sciences does not exist, or that my daily experience is an illusion? If not, what are they talking about? Surely, the issues are of this nature and not ones to take offence to.\n9. The Indian intellectuals living abroad (whether in the middle east, Europe or the USA, or wherever else) have an opportunity and a responsibility. They have the opportunity of living in another culture and study it first hand. They have the responsibility of seeing to it that they do so and communicate its results. We have the ability to perform both these tasks. The real question is: do we have the will to do it as well? Or are we merely going to recycle and peddle barren ideas of the last few centuries?\nOther relevant posts:\nA. Does Hinduism exist?\nB.

My name is not Batra but am known as ‘Balu’. I am not, nor have I ever been, a member of either the BJP (the nationalist party in India) or organizations collectively known as the ‘Sangh Parivar’. Even though I am born a ‘Hindu’, some of my ‘liberal’ associates are convinced that I am a ‘crypto-Christian’. So much about my credentials, which are required to make two points of some importance.\nThese are about Wendy Doniger’s op-ed piece in the NYT. This American ‘expert’ on Indian culture and ‘Hinduism’ epitomizes very accurately the state of the American academia when it talks about other peoples and cultures: ignorance and pompousness.\nIgnorance: she does not even know that the article 295A of the Indian Penal Code (which she refers to) is not about ‘blasphemy’. (Does she knows the meaning of the word, I wonder.) Yet, this inconvenient fact does not faze her from holding forth. Neither does the fact that being a ‘Jew’ is irrelevant to whether one has a ‘Christian’ missionary zeal or not. (Does she know that Judaism also ‘proselytized’ during the Antiquity?) After all, the so-called ‘Hindu fundamentalists’ have been repeatedly accused of exhibiting precisely that zeal which Wendy claims is inappropriate to describe her. This nonchalant attitude is typical not only of her but also of most academics doing India and Hinduism studies in America. Ignorance might not prevent the American academia from sermonizing to the world but, when coupled with pompousness, it damages what many good Americans hold very dear to their hearts: ‘the American national interests’.\nPompousness: Wendy Doniger suggests that the voice of a “narrow band of narrow-minded Hindus” drowned out the voices of “the broader, more liberal parts of Indian society”. (The latter must have been ‘speaking’ too; how otherwise could their voices be ‘drowned out’?)Two questions that even an ordinary child would ask are of relevance here. How could a ‘narrow’ band ‘drown out’ the voice of a ‘broader band’? A possible answer would attempt to identify those in power. One of the things that everyone, especially such intellectual experts, should know about India is that the entire media in India has been under the hegemony of liberal and left-thinking intellectuals ever since independence. Nehru was a socialist; he encouraged leftist intellectuals. His daughter, Indira Gandhi, consciously pursued this strategy: almost all academic institutions and funding agencies are completely in the hands of progressive and left-leaning people. How then, and this is the second question of the kid, could a small number of people (without institutional power or control of the media) outshout those with power? Surely, this does not jell. But this silliness of Wendy is the required stepping stone for the pomposity, which she exhibits when she says that “the dormant liberal conscience of India” was awakened by the “stunning blow to the freedom of speech”. Let us leave aside the question of logical consistency (an inappropriate term to describe Wendy’s thinking) about the “broader band” that ‘speaks’ and yet is alleged to be dormant. The real issue is far more important.\nThat consists of some questions. If we know history, we know too that ‘liberalism’ (as we understand the term today) is a product of the extraordinary culture that the West is. We need to acknowledge the contributions of such people like John Locke or John Stuart Mill, if and when we speak about this wonderful political doctrine. We know too that Indians are indebted to the British for this gift to their thinking. Yet, there are questions here: did the Indian culture go around banning books before the British came to India? Was the Indian culture a prey to systematic campaigns against intellectual productions before the emergence of a liberal conscience? Are we to suppose that if the westernized “liberal conscience” does not wake up, Indian culture will fall victim to the “narrow-minded Hindus”? If, indeed, India burnt and banned books before ‘liberalism’ made its advent into India, Wendy’s thought carries credibility. Actually, that would be a sheer nonsensical claim because it is the other way round: western culture banned and burnt books before the advent of ‘liberalism’; it banned and burnt books also after the advent of ‘liberalism’. Protestants burnt the books of Catholics, Catholics banned and burnt Protestant writings; the Germans, amongst other things, burnt down the entire library of the University of Louvain. The Americans, for their part, unlike the French colonizer, simply bombed away the libraries in Vietnam and elsewhere. In fact, as our history books tell us, it was an enlightenment thinker like David Hume who called upon people to burn libraries, if they housed books that say nothing about “matters of fact” or speak about logic since they can “contain nothing but sophistry and illusion”. He was, of course, referring to books on theology, among other things. (Thus, his logic would have burnt Wendy’s books, seeing that they lack both!) Hence, it is unvarnished pomposity to think that only the western culture embodies freedom of thought and expression, while other cultures are not only primitive but also barbaric and authoritarian.\nThis implicit stance (that cannot be effaced by any number of explicit pronouncements, if one intends to remain consistent) characterizes not just Wendy but most of the American academia that writes about India and Hinduism. It is this attitude that informs the relationship of America with other peoples and nations as well. It is this posture that damages the ‘American national interests’. The incident of Wendy is one of the many warning shots from other parts of the world to all serious, well-intentioned American academics: wake up and listen to what others are saying before it is too late. Do not keep repeating inanities and indulging in table-thumping and breast-beating. Do some serious rethinking for a change. That would help us all.\nComments windwheel — 2014-03-13 19:44:00\nDear old Wendy! She was such a comfort to me in my adolescence. Indeed, many \u0026lsquo;Convent School\u0026rsquo; Indians of my class and background found people like her, and- of course, A.K Ramanujan- just what the Doctor ordered to counter our feeling of inferiority towards those of our cousins who attended Ramakrishna Mission Schools and Vernacular Medium Colleges and who scored higher than us in Maths and could compose verse in Sanskrit and- most humiliating of all- wrote English more grammatically, if not idiomatically, than we did. Wendy and Pollock showed us that all our sacred texts and commentaries and kavyas and itihasasas and manipravalay or Riti type mannerist poetry was the work of really stupid and primitive people who believed in magic and were frightened of women and the polluting touch of the working class. Witzel went one step further and tried to appear a bit of an intellectual by dragging in some psuedo-Scientism about \u0026lsquo;primitive minds\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;highly correlated systems\u0026rsquo; and (more recently) Gondwanan myths and so forth. Sadly, sometime in the early Nineties, we \u0026lsquo;Convent School\u0026rsquo; types woke up to the fact that our provincial cousins were doing better than us in America. Indeed, they were becoming Techie billionaires while the most we could aspire to was a, Gurcharan Das type, genteel fading into Post Retirement garrulity. We had two choices. Either understand that all literary culture, at all times, is intimately connected with the Mechanism Design and Statistical Decision Theory problematics of the period- and thus preserves a \u0026rsquo;trace\u0026rsquo; of Open Problems in Maths- or else just pretend that our Provincial cousins were secretly V.H.P or Jamaati or whatever. Since Maths is hard to do and even harder to apply, being an English speaker, wrt to India, inevitably meant assuming Indians have always been and will always be stupid and primitive. Whether it is Ghalib or Kabir, both the Indian Professor and the American M.F.A poetaster, will always ascribe to them the stupidest and most primitive message.\nI suppose, Nineteenth Century historicist hermeneutics had the Rousseauian, or Romantic, excuse that it valorized as \u0026rsquo;natural\u0026rsquo; that which it identified as primitive. However, Colonial Anthropology- which Freud drew on for his theory of Religion- minced no memes in equating the primitive with the bestial. The corollary was obvious. Indians were incapable of judging their own Culture or Religion. True, as sedulous apes, they might be able to carry forward a non-Indian Indological Research program; indeed, they might even be permitted to enter the durbar of the new Conqueror, but they certainly can\u0026rsquo;t be permitted darshan of Seeta Devi\u0026rsquo;s face. Why? Seeta Devi actually represents some abstract Liberalism which cashes out as \u0026lsquo;regime change\u0026rsquo; which aboriginal monkeys can\u0026rsquo;t grasp and whose visage they mustn\u0026rsquo;t be permitted to glimpse- lest they cry out against the foulness of it.\n","tags":["Wendy Doniger"],"title":"The Wendy Incident: A View from Europe--SN Balagangadhara","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/the-wendy-incident-a-view-from-europe-sn-balagangadhara/"},{"categories":["outlook"],"content":" Jakob de Roover\u0026rsquo;s Untangling the knot Sufiya Pathan\u0026rsquo;s No Alternative Jakob\u0026rsquo;s Disturbing Story Jakob\u0026rsquo;s How Free are We?

But what is important about these shifts in meaning? What exactly is the problem in introducing the category of religion into India or among Native Americans? The category “yuppie” did not exist in the Middle Ages, while “orange” came through Arabic from Sanskrit, and “girl” used to refer to a young person of either sex. When we analyse the genetics of early modern populations, we are also introducing categories that they did not possess. Or take the word “silly,” which in Old English used to mean blessed. So what? An historical analysis of discourse and categories is significant not to identify shifts in meaning per se. Shifts in meaning become significant only against the background of a theory on the historical development of the western culture and its understanding of other cultures.

This difference has many consequences: in the Roman understanding, for example, it is senseless to ask whether a religio is true or false; in the Christian understanding this question is of primordial importance. Even though this problem is noticed, there is a need to delve deeper into the theoretical significance of shifts in meaning and of the introduction of alien categories into new cultural matrices.\nComments Jos De Vos — 2013-05-04 11:12:00\n“What is wrong with the intercultural exchange of categories? Throughout one gets the impression that there is something “fundamentally wrong” with categories shifting in meaning over time or with the introduction of categories from one culture into another culture. But what is important about these shifts in meaning? What exactly is the problem in introducing the category of religion into India or among Native Americans? “\nLet me counter that question with this one: What is wrong with the word ‘category’ itself in a culture where propositional statements are to be found suspicious (Nagarjuna) or theoretical knowledge is embedded in performative knowledge? Answer: reading a book or two will be of no help since it is mental activitity accumulating theoretical knowledge, hence access to performative knowledge denied. Perhaps the only solution that can be provided for is reading-while-jogging.\n“The category “yuppie” did not exist in the Middle Ages, while “orange” came through Arabic from Sanskrit, and “girl” used to refer to a young person of either sex. When we analyse the genetics of early modern populations, we are also introducing categories that they did not possess. Or take the word “silly,” which in Old English used to mean blessed. So what?”\nSome researchers in the field of etymology have made the link of (shifts of) meanings of words to cultural mindset or a societal Zeitgeist. E.g. the category “faith” in Smith’s examination of the evolution of Christian ideas. Or the term “sceptic” in Greek thinking versus the modern version. Are you suggesting this is all bogus research? If you do, then please provide for arguments, extending beyond mere emotional exclamations. No hardtalk without valid alternatives!\n“An historical analysis of discourse and categories is significant not to identify shifts in meaning per se. Shifts in meaning become significant only against the background of a theory on the historical development of the western culture and its understanding of other cultures. Such a theory is needed to clarify as to why a shift in the meaning of “religion” or “the secular” is of crucial importance.”\nSince you proclaim to be in possession of precisely such a theory, you should be able to not only illustrate this claim with the examples mentioned above, but also to test the particularities of your proposed framework: a potential win-win situation. Three categories, “silly” “Yuppie” “girl”: kindly show us how the historical significance emerges in the context of your superior theoretical framework.\n“Let us illustrate this point.

This last group claims that the Latin word religio had a completely different meaning to the “pagan” Romans — namely, religio referred to ancestral traditional practices — as compared to what “religion” would signify after the Christians transformed it into true belief.”\nThis is a very bad example since Roman culture, and ‘religio’ in specific, cannot be explained in your theoretical framework because it lacks the properties that are supposed to make up either one of the two identified learning configurations. Still, its culture was very expansive, which make it similar in effect to the dynamic of proselytisation. Talking of theoretical insufficiency! The same counts for the category “scepticism” or any other term borrowed from the Roman-Greek culture.\n“This is interesting, not so much because it shows nuances in the meaning of the word “religion,” but because it reveals that the Roman religio was a phenomenon completely different from the Christian religion and the modern understanding of religion.

The onus of proof is now on you to explain this in terms of the double dynamic of secularisation and proselytisation - I understand it has even become a \u0026ldquo;triple\u0026rdquo; one recently with the advent of the \u0026rsquo;topoi-force\u0026rsquo; - , not only in contrast to Christianity, but also to Judaism and Islam. For starters: note that Judaism has no intrinsic proselytisation since it is a connection through birth, and that Islam has hardly known any secularisation to date. Besides, Roman culture was expansive and Greek culture internally very saturated. How to account for these mechanisms?\nwindwheel — 2013-07-19 07:56:00\n\u0026lsquo;in the Roman understanding, for example, it is senseless to ask whether a religio is true or false\u0026rsquo;- I don\u0026rsquo;t think this is true.

N. Srinivas (MNS) claims that \u0026ldquo;a caste was able, in a generation or two, to rise to a higher position in the hierarchy by adopting vegetarianism and teetotalism and by changing its rituals and deities.\u0026rdquo; The first basic problem here is how one can establish the position of a jati in the supposed hierarchy and measure it in such detail that one can see over two generations that the jati has attained a higher position. Which standard does one use to establish the position of jati x? What members of jati x say about its position relative to other jatis? What members of other jatis say about the position of x relative to their own jatis? As our fieldwork in Karnataka has already shown, it is impossible to infer any hierarchy from such empirical data, because all one gets is a series of inconsistent statements with regard to the relative positions of jatis. This basic problem becomes even more intractable when we take into account the history of assigning positions to jatis in the so-called \u0026ldquo;caste hierarchy\u0026rdquo;. When the British had their caste census in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, many jatis classified as shudras or untouchables sent in petitions arguing that they held higher positions; they were kshatriyas, they said. Today, the same jatis insist that they are really shudras or untouchables and should be classified as OBCs or SCs. When jatis can radically revise their \u0026lsquo;position in the hierarchy\u0026rsquo; according to the status or benefits they win by doing so, what could one ever conclude about their position and how it changes over generations? Should one calculate the average socio-economic level of jati x and compare it to the average level of other jatis? Apart from difficulties in calculating this socio-economic level, one faces an even more difficult problem: how does one circumscribe jati x? Are two groups with the same name both sub-divisions of jati x? What if they claim they are different jatis? What geographical or social unit should one begin with to establish the (socio-economic) position of jati x in the hierarchy? Let us say one takes the village as the relevant unit. How does the socio-economic level that jati x enjoys in some village tell us anything about its position in the hierarchy? If the socio-economic welfare of jati x increases markedly over two generations in this village, does this mean it has attained a higher position? What if the same jati in the surrounding villages has declined? In terms of empirical data, then, it becomes impossible to say (a) what the position is of a jati in the supposed hierarchy and (b) when it has attained a higher position. In other words, MNS can never have inferred his conclusions about Sanskritization and castes rising to higher positions from his \u0026lsquo;fieldwork data\u0026rsquo;.\nOf course, some jati may adopt practices from another jati. Let us even admit that some jatis regularly adopted practices from certain groups of Brahmins. What does this show? It certainly does not show that \u0026lsquo;a low caste\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;took over, as far as possible, the customs, rites, and beliefs of the Brahmins\u0026rdquo; and adopted \u0026ldquo;the Brahminic way of life.\u0026rdquo; By observing all the different groups of Brahmins and their different customs and rites or by collecting the beliefs of Brahmin individuals, one cannot through some process of induction come to \u0026ldquo;the Brahminic way of life\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;the customs, rites and beliefs of the Brahmins\u0026rdquo; (unless one means the set of all customs, rites and beliefs ever held or engaged in by all Brahmins who ever lived). So it does not make sense to claim that low castes took over the Brahminic way of life. Maximally, some practices of some Brahmin jatis were adopted by some other jatis. Does this demonstrate that these other jatis attributed a higher position to the Brahmin jatis in question? One may suggest that this is self-evident or at least very plausible, but this is a kind of half-baked social psychology that does not result from theorizing or research. Take a few instances from European history. In nineteenth-century Western Europe, it was very common for the up and coming bourgeoisie (industrialists, entrepreneurs) to imitate the nobility. For instance, they began to imitate eating with cutlery and cutting one\u0026rsquo;s bread with a knife. (There is a story that the nobility in France one day decided collectively to start breaking the bread with one\u0026rsquo;s hands instead of cutting it, so as to humiliate the bourgeoisie and show that it could never become like the nobility.) Did this practice of imitating the nobility show that the bourgeoisie attributed a higher position to the nobility? In one sense, the bourgeoisie did so: culturally, the nobility was considered \u0026rsquo;noble\u0026rsquo;; in another sense, they did not: the bourgeoisie often were more affluent and socio-economically more important. Another instance comes from medieval Europe: when Christian monasteries flourished in the middle ages, lay groups began to imitate the monks, adopt all kinds of practices from them and live ascetically like them. Did this show that the monks were given a higher position in \u0026rsquo;the hierarchy\u0026rsquo;? Not really. The churchly hierarchy of priests and bishops held more power; many knights looked down upon the monks; some laymen admired them and thought that the monks were working for the collective salvation of the Christian ecclesia. From such examples and from social psychology in general, we cannot infer some general law that \u0026ldquo;if one social group adopts practices from another social group or imitates it, this shows that the latter has a higher position than the former.\u0026rdquo;\nSo MNS cannot have inferred his account about Sanskritization and castes rising to higher positions from social psychology or the general laws of social psychology across cultures and societies.\nIf neither empirical data nor social-scientific theorizing could ever bring one to the story about Sanskritization, how then can we explain that MNS found it cogent and many Indians and westerners until this day find it extremely plausible? One part of the story is that he presupposed the existence of the caste hierarchy with Brahmins at the top and untouchables at the bottom and a flexible range of \u0026ldquo;middle regions of the hierarchy.\u0026rdquo; This is not to say that he started out with a well-formulated hypothesis about the caste hierarchy and tried to test it empirically, but that he presupposed the fairly vague classical account on the caste hierarchy as the background framework that structured every description of the \u0026lsquo;facts\u0026rsquo; he encountered in his fieldwork. This is clear from his statement that \u0026ldquo;adoption of the Brahminic way of life by a low caste\u0026rdquo; is \u0026ldquo;theoretically forbidden.\u0026rdquo; Which theory is MNS referring to here? The theory of the caste system as it was and is held by different jatis in India or by the Brahmins or the so-called \u0026ldquo;upper castes\u0026rdquo;? There is no such theory to be found. Such a \u0026ldquo;theory\u0026rdquo; was developed by European scholars reflecting on their experience of Indian society: they linked some fragments of texts like the Manusmriti to certain descriptions of practices and groups in Indian society and constructed the \u0026ldquo;theory\u0026rdquo; of the caste system, which projects a hierarchy with certain \u0026lsquo;rules\u0026rsquo;. It is only when one presupposes this caste hierarchy that it becomes self-evident that castes could climb on the hierarchical ladder by adopting the \u0026ldquo;Brahminic way of life\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Sanskritizing\u0026rdquo; themselves. In fact, Srinivas\u0026rsquo; story about Sanskritization merely inverts the old Orientalist story about the way in which Brahmanism spread and the \u0026lsquo;Aryan people\u0026rsquo; subjugated the aboriginal inhabitants of the subcontinent. This nineteenth-century story claims that the \u0026lsquo;Aryan\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;Brahmanical people\u0026rsquo; used the caste system to absorb all aboriginal and Dravidian peoples into the basic structure of Brahmanism, while allowing these groups to retain their old beliefs. Thus, the \u0026lsquo;Aryan Brahmins\u0026rsquo; established their authority and superiority in Indian society. In this process, the aboriginal and Dravidian groups are supposed to have adopted the basic beliefs of Brahmanism and thus accepted the lower positions in the caste system. It would take us too far to go into the development and background assumptions of this European story about India, but it does raise some questions about MNS\u0026rsquo; often-lauded creativity in developing the notion of Sanskritization. His creativity consisted of inverting an old Orientalist story and selecting and interpreting his empirical data in such a way that they seemed to provide foundations for this story.\nComments windwheel — 2013-09-27 08:25:00\nAmbedkar explicitly mentions Gabriel Tarde\u0026rsquo;s \u0026lsquo;Law of imitation\u0026rsquo; which assumes that \u0026lsquo;inferiors\u0026rsquo; imitate their superiors though his use of Tarde cuts against his own (or rather Ayothi Dasan\u0026rsquo;s) thesis. Srinivas is a bit of a mystery. Was he pulling our leg all along? There\u0026rsquo;s an amusing report by a bunch of North Eastern Anthropology students who recently did a field trip to Srinivas\u0026rsquo;s famous village. The funniest part of it is the one which reflects the consternation of the young (mainly Christian) students from the North East when confronted with the elderly South Indian Brahmin\u0026rsquo;s love for public defecation- \u0026lsquo;communing with nature\u0026rsquo; as we call it. My theory is that we admire the insouciance of our sacred cows in this respect and, by Tarde\u0026rsquo;s law, seek to emulate them. One point I don\u0026rsquo;t understand. Why blame Orientalism for everything? Punditry, Western or Eastern, is only about defecating on the public thoroughfare and all are equal in this respect. Quod licet bovi, non licet Jovi. Mooo-ind it kindly.\nParag Waknis — 2013-12-12 19:07:00\nInteresting post! If I understand your claims right, because at different points in time different jatis would claim differential status depending on economic gains in doing so, MNS could not posited \u0026lsquo;sanskritization\u0026rsquo; based on field work. Also, adopting behavior of certain castes, namely the brahmins, cannot be thought of as evidence for hierarchy. You cite numerous counter examples to support your points. However, one could cite numerous examples to counter your argument and support MNS claims and neither of this would be theorizing.\nTo actually think of counter examples, the castes of saraswats, goud saraswats and chandra seni kayastha prabhu tried to use their royal connections with Peshwas of Maharashtra to change their status to brahmin equivalent. This case could be thought of as an evidence for hierarchy- why would you change otherwise? A Marxian response would be that being brahmin equivalent meant economic gains and hence cannot be thought of as evidence for hierarchy. Even if that were true, which I am not sure of, why did the rents for being a brahmin were higher in the first place? If one tries to answer that question, then the relative socio-economic value placed on different castes could constitute as evidence of hierarchy.\nAlso, you decide to pay, or change lifestyle in the light of contemporary ideas constituting the status you want to upgrade to. You do not have to embody all that can be ever counted as a symbol of the status you are trying to upgrade yourself. What I am trying to say is you have to think of society as a dynamic being- what it means to be a noble or a brahmin has never been constant- you approximate your life style to suit your understanding of what it means to be nobility or upper caste. For example, the Vanderbilts and Astors building palatial houses to imitate the nobility from Western Europe. Why did they not choose to do anything else with their money? In language of math you have to be in the epsilon neighborhood of what you think is ideal. How small or large is the epsilon in order to admit equality would then depend on lot of socio-economic-cultural factors.\nDharmesh — 2015-11-04 09:50:22\nAn extraordinary piece by Balagangadhara.

For an alternative research programme (paradigm) for studying India, Indian culture and Indian culture, study Balagangadhara\u0026rsquo;s Reconceptualizing Indian Studies, published by OUP, India.\nThere are few places in the contemporary world where the problems of cultural pluralism are as acute as they are in India. The Indian case poses fundamental challenges to the political theory of toleration. By tackling the problem of religious conversion, our analysis shows that the dominant way of conceiving state neutrality becomes untenable in the Indian context. The Indian state, modelled after the liberal democracies in the West, is the harbinger of religious conflict in India because of its conception of toleration and state neutrality. More of \u0026lsquo;secularism\u0026rsquo; in India will end up feeding what it fights: the so-called \u0026lsquo;Hindu fundamentalism\u0026rsquo;.\nThe Participants and the Issues\nIn the Indian debate on the Hindu-Muslim conflict, three parties claim to offer a solution. The secularists argue the need for a secular state in India; the Hindu nationalists or advocates of Hindutva plead the case for a Hindu state; and the anti-secular Gandhians claim that the Indian culture has the resources to handle the question of religious pluralism. For the sake of argument and convenience, we will divide these parties into two groups, viz. secularists and anti-secularists.\nOn the one hand, there are the proponents of secularism: they propose that the Hindus and the Muslims (and the other communities) should accept a common framework of secular law. This framework claims neutrality with respect to all religions. The position of secularism in India is generally associated with the ideas of her first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, who once said that \u0026ldquo;no state can be civilised except a secular state.\u0026quot;[1] The Indian secularists defend a position well-known to political theory: the obligation of religious neutrality of a liberal state.\nOn the other hand, there are the opponents of secularism: they refuse to accept the western theories about the religiously neutral state and offer an alternate system of traditional values. The different communities, they feel, should accept this system as the common framework. Its fundamental principle is the equality of religions: since all religions are incomplete manifestations of a supreme truth, all of them are equal. This group consists of the advocates of Hindutva on the one side and the Gandhian anti-secularists on the other. Although significant differences exist between these two parties, they agree on one issue: in India, politics should not be separated from religion because Hinduism yields a more tolerant politics than western secularism. One of the Hindutva spokesmen voices a widespread opinion when he says that \u0026lsquo;Hindu secularism\u0026rsquo; is superior to western secularism:\n\u0026hellip; ll through the history, the Hindu state has been secular. All Hindu rulers were expected to live up to the ideal of \u0026lsquo;Sarva Panth Sama Bhava\u0026rsquo; in their dealings with the people. This concept of \u0026rsquo;equal respect for all panths or ways of worship\u0026rsquo; is a positive concept with a much wider and broader meaning than what is conveyed by the concept of secularism as accepted in the West.[2]\nOr, to let the most distinguished among the Gandhian anti-secularists, Ashis Nandy, explain the moral of his story:\n\u0026hellip;t is time to recognize that, instead of trying to build religious tolerance on the good faith or the conscience of a small group of de-ethnicized, middle-class politicians, bureaucrats, and intellectuals, a far more serious venture would be to explore the philosophy, the symbolism, and the theology of tolerance in the faiths of the citizens and hope that the state systems in South Asia may learn something about religious tolerance from everyday Hinduism, Islam, Buddhism, or Sikhism rather than wish that ordinary Hindus, Muslims, Buddhists, and Sikhs will learn tolerance from the various fashionable secular theories of statecraft.[3]\nThe anti-secularists challenge the belief that different religious communities can live together in a society only within the framework of a religiously neutral state. Thus, the debate revolves around one of the basic tenets of the contemporary theories of toleration, viz. the belief that state neutrality is necessary for a peaceful and viable plural society.\nOne should not reduce the clash between secularism and anti-secularism to a clash between a tolerant, progressive left and an intolerant, conservative right. Instead, it is a clash between two frameworks both claiming to provide a solution to the problem of conflicts between the different communities in Indian society. Both parties agree on the objective of a peacefully diverse society. Both allow people to worship in whichever way they prefer and to whatever god(s) they prefer. Both allow the followers of the various religions to visit their mosques, churches, gurudwaras, temples, or stay home. Both allow people to believe in one God, or in three or five thousand gods or claim that there is no God. If there is agreement on these issues, what then is the clash about?\nWe would like to address this question by taking up the issue of religious conversion. Hindutva wants a ban on conversion in India. It feels that the state should enact a law constraining the proselytising drive of Christianity and Islam. This proposal is anathema to the secularists, who insist that the state should protect the religious liberty of the individual. Why does Hindutva feel such strong aversion towards religious conversion? One suggestion is that the movement consists of religious fanatics. However, this fails to take into account that many Hindus, hardly illiberal fanatics, hold similar views. Mahatma Gandhi, for instance, said at one point that if he had the power to legislate, he would ban all proselytising: \u0026ldquo;If I had the power and could legislate, I would stop all proselytizing…In Hindu households the advent of a missionary has meant the disruption of the family coming in the wake of change of dress, manners, language, food and drink…\u0026quot;[4] This view is still prevalent among contemporary Gandhians. As Manikam Ramaswami puts it:\nIn a pluralistic society if people have to live in harmony, one group that believes its assumed form of God is superior and tries to convert the thinking of others will not certainly help. One group trying to impose its views on others based on its unconfirmable assumptions will certainly cause social tension and should not be permitted in a secular society. The pseudo seculars who call it religious freedom to convert, if they apply their mind will understand banning conversion, forced or otherwise, is not a Hindutva agenda; on the other hand not banning conversion is the agenda of the aggressive religions.[5]\nWhile the secularists agree with the Muslim and Christian minorities that the latter must be free to proselytise, most of the anti-secularists intend to defend the interests of the Hindus. Hindutva backs a Hindu state; the secularists strive for a secular state, which is neutral towards all religions. As noted, the secularists defend a normative principle of state neutrality. They say that one ought to separate politics from religion because without such a separation, the state cannot treat all religions in a neutral or symmetric manner. The secularists offer several rationales and, together, these bring them to the belief \u0026ldquo;that secularism in India, as elsewhere, is indispensable.\u0026quot;[6] Our questions are these: Could the Indian state remain neutral on the issue of religious conversion? If yes, what would neutrality mean in the Indian context?\n1. The Four Premises of a Secular State\nReligious conversion is a problem in India when Islam or Christianity tries to convert people from Hinduism. That is to say, it is not an issue of converting Muslims into Christianity or the other way round, but one of converting Hindus into either of the two. If the secular state has to be religiously neutral, it must have a symmetrical attitude toward all religious conversions and not favour one type of conversion above another. That is, it must treat conversions between the Semitic religions and from Hinduism to the Semitic religions in the same way, namely, as conversions between different religions. In that case, it confronts the following problem. Are the Semitic religions and the Hindu traditions phenomena of the same kind? A religiously neutral state has to assume a positive answer to this question, if it has to treat Hinduism and the Semitic religions symmetrically. However, this assumption has no warrant. If anything, the prima facie evidence points to the falsity of this assumption. A random selection of claims put across by the students of the Hindu traditions ought to suffice in this context.\nIn the second of the multi-volume Historia Religionum, an Indian, talking about Hinduism, says that\nHinduism can hardly be called a religion in the popularly understood sense of the term. Unlike most religions, Hinduism does not regard the concept of god as being central to it…Hinduism does not venerate any particular person as its sole prophet or as its founder. It does not…recognize any particular book as its absolutely authoritative scripture.[7]\nSimilar thoughts occur in a handbook written by experts in the area, aimed at a more general public:\nHinduism displays few of the characteristics that are generally expected of a religion. It has no founder, nor is it prophetic. It is not credal, nor is any particular doctrine, dogma or practice held to be essential to it. It is not a system of theology, nor a single moral code, and the concept of god is not central to it. There is no specific scripture or work regarded as being uniquely authoritative and, finally, it is not sustained by an ecclesiastical organization. Thus it is difficult to categorize Hinduism as \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo; using normally accepted criteria.[8]\nIndeed. The problem is not confined to Hinduism. Collins, a Buddhologist, is not sanguine about Buddhism either. Speaking of the mistake of using emic categories of Christian thought, as though they were etic categories of description and analysis in the academic study of religions, Collins adds in parentheses, \u0026ldquo;perhaps the most pervasive example of this is the concept of \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo; itself.\u0026quot;[9]\nCitations like the above could be multiplied indefinitely, but we trust the point is made. There are prima facie grounds to suspect that the Hindu traditions and the Semitic religions are phenomena of different kinds. Nevertheless, without providing arguments to the contrary, the secular state assumes that the Semitic religions and the Hindu traditions are instances of the same kind. Students of religion almost routinely make such remarks as the above and go on to study the Hindu and Buddhist traditions as \u0026lsquo;religions\u0026rsquo; of a different kind. We need not discuss here whether their attempts are satisfactory or not.[10] The point is that no student of religion is willing or able to argue that Hinduism and the Semitic religions are phenomena of the same kind. Consequently, the onus is on those who want to argue that these two phenomena are instances of the same kind. In other words, the secular state cannot assume the opposite of \u0026lsquo;scientific wisdom\u0026rsquo; without compelling arguments.\nHowever, there is one story or one compelling argument that opposes \u0026lsquo;scientific wisdom\u0026rsquo;. It comes from the theologies of the Semitic religions. Let us recount the simplest version of that story. There was once a religion, the true and universal one, which was the divine gift to humankind. The (Biblical) God installs a sense or spark of divinity in all races (and individuals). During the course of human history, this sense is corrupted. Idolatry, worship of the Devil (viz., the false god and his minions) was to be the lot of humankind until (the Biblical) God spoke to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and led their tribe back onto the true path. Of course, it is possible that this story is true; after all, those who follow these religions do believe in its truth. Is this enough for a secular state to accept the truth of this claim? In answering this question, the secular state cannot be neutral. The choices are but two: (a) the state accepts some variant of the above theological story and treats Hinduism and the Semitic religions as phenomena of the same kind; or (b) it gives in to the prima facie difference, and (in the absence of better arguments) treats the Semitic religions and the Hindu traditions as phenomena of a different kind.\nReligions as Rivals\nAbstractly speaking, the freedom to convert people into some religion or the other might indicate the presence of a \u0026lsquo;desirable\u0026rsquo; value in a society, namely, the value of the freedom of religious expression. What such a value logically presupposes, in any case, is the truth of the assumption that these religions are rival movements. This is a factual assumption, whose factual nature can be brought to light by noticing that no logical difficulties are created if we assume the existence of multiple religions without postulating that they also compete with each other. However, this factual assumption requires justification because history tells us the opposite.\nIt is a matter of historical fact that Christianity and Islam have been rivals, wherever and whenever they met each other. Could we say the same about the contact between the Hindu traditions and these religions? A Protestant writer from the late eighteenth century, drawing upon the work of François Bernier, the seventeenth-century French merchant and explorer, reports the following:\nWhen the Brahmins have been pressed by the arguments of the Christians, that their law could only be observed in their own country, on account of its peculiar ordinances, their answer has been uniform, \u0026rsquo;that God had only made it for them, and therefore they did not admit into it strangers; that they pretended not that Christianity was false; and since God could make many roads to heaven, it was not thence to be presumed that their religion was mere fable and invention\u0026rsquo;.[11]\nOr as a Hindu Brahmin of coastal Tamil Nadu assured Bartholomaeus Ziegenbalg, a Lutheran missionary, during the early eighteenth century:\nI believe all you say of God\u0026rsquo;s Dealings with you White Europeans, to be true; but his Appearances and Revelations among us Black Malabarians, have been quite otherwise: And the Revelations he made of himself in this Land are as firmly believ\u0026rsquo;d here to be true, as you believe those made in your Country: For as Christ in Europe was made Man; so here our God Wischtnu was born among us Malabarians; And as you hope for Salvation through Christ; so we hope for Salvation through Wischtnu; and to save you one way, and us another, is one of the Pastimes and Diversions of Almighty God.[12]\nThe famous Muslim traveller to India, Alberuni, also noted the absence of religious rivalry among the Hindus in the eleventh century: \u0026ldquo;On the whole, there is very little disputing about theological topics among themselves; at the utmost, they fight with words, but they will never stake their soul or body or their property on religious controversy.\u0026quot;[13] Although Alberuni continued to say that the Hindus directed their fanaticism against foreigners, it was clear that the Hindus did not do so because they considered the latter to be propagators of false religion. In fact, an analysis of Hindu Sanskrit sources on the Muslims from the eighth to the fourteenth century reveals that \u0026ldquo;the construction of the other is made neither in religious nor in territorial terms; in other words, although the term dharma is used in the sense of religion, the Muslims are not projected as a community practising a religion which is the antithesis of recognized religious practices.\u0026quot;[14] Thus, traditionally, the Hindus did not even identify the Muslims along religious lines, let alone consider them as religious rivals.\nIn other words, the Hindu traditions refused to accept that theirs was false \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo; and that Christianity or Islam was the true one. Nor were they willing to say that Christianity or Islam was false. They merely maintained that these traditions could co-exist without competing with each other as rivals. This is the Hindu view of the matter. The Semitic religions, on the other hand, advance the claim that they and the Hindu traditions are competing or rival movements. Between these two positions, again, there is no neutral ground: (a) the Semitic religions and the Hindu traditions are competitors with respect to each other, or (b) they are not. The secular state has to choose between these two logically exclusive premises as well.\nReligion and the Question of Truth\nConsider the following two propositions about religious truth: (a) religion revolves around the truth of its doctrine; (b) the predicates \u0026rsquo;truth\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;falsity\u0026rsquo; do not apply to human traditions. These views have been held by two different kinds of groups: the Semitic religions that Christianity and Islam are; and the \u0026lsquo;pagan\u0026rsquo; traditions of the Antiquity and the Hindu Indians.\nOn the one hand, Christianity and Islam claim that because they are the unique revelations of (the Biblical) God to humankind, they are true. They believe that there is one true God, who is the creator and sovereign of the universe. Everything that happens in the universe expresses His will or purpose. In other words, (this Biblical) God has a plan, and the universe is the embodiment of this plan. According to each of these religions, their respective doctrine is the true self-disclosure in which (this Biblical) God reveals His will or plan to humankind. Only through a genuine belief in this doctrine and in a total surrender to this Divine Will can human beings hope for salvation.\nA random citation, from an epistle said to have been composed around 124 C.E., the period of the Apostolic Fathers, illustrates how Christians described their religion from the very beginning. In The Epistle to Diognetus, purporting to be a \u0026ldquo;reply to an inquiring heathen\u0026rsquo;s desire for information about the beliefs and customs of Christians,\u0026rdquo; an anonymous writer explains:\nThe doctrines they (the Christians) profess is not the invention of busy human minds and brains, nor are they, like some, adherents of this or that school of human thought. As I said before, it is not an earthly discovery that has been entrusted to them. The thing they guard so jealously is no product of mortal thinking, and what has been committed to them is the stewardship of no human mysteries. The Almighty Himself, the Creator of the universe, the God whom no eye can discern, has sent down His very own Truth from heaven, His own holy and incomprehensible Word, to plant it among men and ground it in their hearts.[15]\nNaturally, this self-description also carries with it a description of the other. Other religions are heresies, false religions, or idolatry and the worship of the devil. After living thirty years among the Hindus in the \u0026lsquo;headquarters\u0026rsquo; of Hinduism, viz., Benares, this is how Reverend M. A. Sherring formulated the issue in the nineteenth century:\n(Here) idolatry is a charm, a fascination, to the Hindu. It is, so to speak, the air he breathes. It is the food of his soul. He is subdued, enslaved, befooled by it. The nature of the Hindu partakes of the supposed nature of the gods whom he worships. And what is that nature? According to the traditions handed about amongst the natives, and constantly dwelt upon in their conversation, and referred to in their popular songs – which perhaps would be sufficient proof – yet more especially according to the numberless statements and narratives found in their sacred writings, on which these traditions are based, it is, in many instances, vile and abominable to the last degree. Idolatry is a word denoting all that is wicked in imagination and impure in practice. Idolatry is a demon – an incarnation of all evil – but nevertheless bewitching and seductive as a siren. It ensnares the depraved heart, coils around it like a serpent, transfixes it with its deadly fangs, and finally stings it to death.[16]\nAll these traditions are nothing but the attempts of the false god to deceive the gullible and to corrupt the true religion.[17] Thus, the Semitic view has it that religion revolves around the crucial question of the truth and falsity of a set of doctrines.\nOn the other hand, there is the pagan self-description, as evidenced both in the Hindu traditions and in the religio of the Ancient Romans. These self-descriptions see the various traditions as a human search for \u0026rsquo;truth\u0026rsquo;, and they see the different religions as paths in this ongoing quest. As Gandhi writes: \u0026ldquo;Religions are different roads converging to the same point. What does it matter that we take different roads so long as we reach the same goal?\u0026quot;[18] Or in the famous words of Quintus Aurelius Symmachus, the last pagan prefect of Rome: \u0026ldquo;Everyone has his own customs, his own religious practices…What does it matter what practical system we adopt in our search for truth? Not by one avenue only can we arrive at so tremendous a secret.\u0026quot;[19]Though there are many differences between the Ancient Roman pagans and today\u0026rsquo;s Hindus, they share a common attitude which distinguishes them from Christians and Muslims alike. They do not approach the diversity of human traditions in terms of doctrinal truth.\nIn the pagan view, there is no one true God opposing whom stand many false gods. There are different \u0026lsquo;deities\u0026rsquo;; there are different stories about them; different traditions differentiate communities from one another. Although this view might countenance the belief of the followers of the Semitic religions, it cannot but see this as the story of some particular traditions. That is, it inevitably transforms the revelation of the Biblical God into another human avenue. Let us assume that both the pagans and the Christians are in agreement with the premise that \u0026lsquo;all things in human affairs are doubtful, uncertain, and unsettled\u0026rsquo;. By virtue of this, religions also share this attribute, say the pagans. Their religion does not, say the Christians, because it is the truth itself, as revealed by the Divine mind. Better put: the religions of Antiquity were false religions because they were inventions of \u0026ldquo;busy human minds,\u0026rdquo; whereas Christianity was the Truth because none other than (the Biblical) God entrusted stewardship of His truth to the Christians. In other words, Christians opposed their true religion to the false religiones of the Roman period and later to the \u0026lsquo;pagan idolatry\u0026rsquo; of the Hindus.\nTo most Hindus, on the contrary, the question of \u0026rsquo;truth\u0026rsquo; in tradition does not even make sense. The Hindu practices generally revolve around a series of puja rituals and traditional stories about Shiva, Krishna, Rama, Kali, Durga and other devatas or \u0026lsquo;deities\u0026rsquo;. In the same way as it does not make sense to inquire whether the western practice for men to wear trousers is true or false, so is it a category mistake to pose truth questions about human traditions in general, from the Hindu perspective. This incomprehension towards the notion of \u0026lsquo;religious truth\u0026rsquo; has given rise to the claim that Hindus look at the truth of religions in a different way. The Hindu view does involve the ascription of truth-predicates to religions, it is said, but in a \u0026lsquo;pluralist\u0026rsquo; manner: \u0026lsquo;all religions are true\u0026rsquo;. However, it is unclear what it means for truth to be conceived pluralistically.[20] More importantly, this attribution of a pluralistic notion of religious truth to the Hindus threatens to turn them into beings who lack the basic capacity of consistent reasoning. If all religions are true, both Christian and Islamic doctrine have to be true at the same time. This claim then entails that Hindus fail to see that one religious doctrine which claims that God is both Father, Son and Holy Spirit and that Jesus Christ is the son of God stands in contradiction to another which asserts that God is one and cannot have a son who is both divine and human.\nIn contrast, our explanation avoids transforming Hindus into logical cretins. It agrees that, today, English-educated Hindus have learnt to talk in terms of \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo; and \u0026rsquo;truth\u0026rsquo;. Historically, the pagan traditions have generally tried to make sense of the Judeo-Christian claims about \u0026lsquo;religious truth\u0026rsquo; from their traditional perspective. The result is the often-repeated claim that \u0026lsquo;all religions are true\u0026rsquo;. This does not reflect a peculiar notion of religious truth, but an attempt to translate the attitude of one culture into the language of another. Even though Hindus have discussed \u0026rsquo;truth\u0026rsquo; in Indian languages also, this \u0026rsquo;truth\u0026rsquo; appears to be of a completely different kind than the doctrinal truth claimed by the Semitic religions. Until we have a clear insight into its nature, it is best to stress that the Hindu view does not see the different traditions of humanity as either true or false.\nConversion is possible from the false to the true only if one assumes that both the traditions of Antiquity and Christianity opposed each other with respect to truth and falsity. This holds not only regarding the traditions from the Antiquity but also with respect to the Hindu traditions of today. Consequently, the secular state that allows for the possibility of conversion is compelled to choose between the following: (a) both the Hindu traditions and the Semitic religions are epistemic candidates with respect to truth and falsity; (b) or they are not.\nProselytisation versus Non-Interference\nThe Semitic self-description contains a universal truth claim, which gives rise to a dynamic of proselytisation. When (the Biblical) God reveals His plan, it covers the whole of humankind. Those who receive this revelation should try to convert the others into accepting the message in this divine self-disclosure. That is, proselytizing is an intrinsic drive of Islam and Christianity. The pagan view, on the contrary, implies that every \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo; is a tradition – i.e., a specific set of ancestral practices – characterising a human community. The traditions are upheld not because they contain some exclusive truth binding the believer to God, but because they make some community into a community. Any attempt at interfering with the tradition of a community from the outside will be seen as illegitimate, since all traditions are part of the human quest for truth. We can again turn to the pagan prefect Symmachus\u0026rsquo;s justly famous letter to the Christian Emperor Valentinian II:\nGrant, I beg you, that what in our youth we took over from our fathers, we may in our old age hand on to posterity. The love of established practice is a powerful sentiment…Everyone has his own customs, his own religious practices; the divine mind has assigned to different cities different religions to be their guardians…If long passage of time lends validity to religious observances, we ought to keep faith with so many centuries, we ought to follow our forefathers who followed their forefathers and were blessed in so doing. …And so we ask for peace for the gods of our fathers, for the gods of our native land. It is reasonable that whatever each of us worships is really to be considered one and the same.[21]\nGiven this opposition between proselytisation and non-interference, consider the situation in India. Here, citizen x is a Hindu who endorses the pagan claim that all traditions are part of a human quest for truth; while citizens y and z are a Muslim and a Christian respectively, who believe that their religion is the true revelation of (the Biblical) God, while all other \u0026rsquo;traditions\u0026rsquo; are false religions. This situation involves a deep conflict of values. The value of non-interference is central to the tradition of citizen x and it is unethical for him to allow Muslims and Christians to interfere in the traditions of human communities. Thus, he opposes conversion. At the same time, the value of proselytisation is central to the religions of citizen y and z. They have to propagate the true message and show to the adherents of other \u0026rsquo;traditions\u0026rsquo; that they are practicing idolatry, the greatest sin according to these religions. Since non-compliance implies that they disobey (the Biblical) God\u0026rsquo;s will, it would be profoundly immoral not to spread this message and try to save the heathens or the kafirs from eternal damnation. Thus, they strongly feel conversion ought to be allowed.\nHow can the Indian state be neutral with respect to the attitudes of the citizens x, y and z? Either the state agrees with citizen x that \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo; is a human quest, no \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo; could be false, and, therefore, ban conversion; or it will have to agree with citizens y and z that religions could be the revelation of (the Biblical) God, therefore, some \u0026lsquo;religions\u0026rsquo; could be false, and thus allow for conversion. In other words, the secular state has to choose between the following two premises: (a) no religion could be false or (b) some religion(s) could be false. There is no neutral ground between these two logically exclusive premises.\nThese aspects of the Semitic religions and the pagan traditions—namely, proselytisation and non-interference—are bound to collide in a society where the Semitic religions encounter pagan traditions as a living force. This is exactly what is happening in India today. Though a growing number of Hindus speaks in such terms, the widespread discontent about conversion is not generally caused by the fear that the whole of India will become Christian or Muslim. Some groups may take this scenario seriously, but it does not explain the equally strong aversion towards conversion among those who do not. Many reasonable minds, who do not see an imminent threat of India becoming an Islamic country, still consider religious conversion to be a violation of the social fabric, for it goes straight against the traditional Hindu stance of non-interference.\nThe anti-secularist movement has adopted the pagan view of the Hindu traditions, and this implies that one community should not interfere in the tradition of another. Naturally, the proselytizing drive and the exclusive truth-claims of Islam and Christianity become extremely problematic in a society where non-interference has the force of self-evidence. The pagan view about the traditions of human communities explains why the Hindutva movement and the Gandhians argue for a ban on conversion. The secularists reply that such a measure would simply make a principle of the Hindus into a \u0026lsquo;religious rule\u0026rsquo; to be followed by all others, while a truly neutral framework should allow the Muslim and Christian minorities to propagate and spread their religion. The secularists are not as neutral as they think they are. Their plea for conversion indicates that they have made their choice.\nLet us now summarise the four choices the Indian secular state has to make. (a) The \u0026lsquo;Hindu traditions\u0026rsquo; and the \u0026lsquo;Semitic religions\u0026rsquo; are phenomena of the same kind, or they are not. (b) As such, they are religious rivals, or they are not. (c) As rivals, they compete with each other regarding truth or falsity, or they do not. (d) They can do that because some religion is false, or they cannot because no religion is false. In each of the four cases, these claims are those of the Semitic religions and the Hindu traditions respectively. Each of these assumptions carves the universe up into two exhaustive partitions, because, in each case, one statement is the logical negation of the other. So, what should a liberal state do in such a situation? What choices are open to it, if it wants to remain neutral and secular?\n2. The Liberal Choices\nIn the context of ethics and normative political theory, one could conceivably [22] endorse Kant\u0026rsquo;s famous dictum \u0026ldquo;ought implies can.\u0026rdquo; That is, if a normative system prescribes some moral rule or another, this implies that human beings or institutions are able to follow that particular rule. If we accept this principle while framing our account of state neutrality, the proposition that the state ought to be neutral implies that the state can be neutral. Thus, on this construal, liberal neutrality is obligatory only if the state can be neutral toward the different religious and cultural traditions in a society. However, the choices that the Indian state confronts are logically exclusive. Furthermore, each term in the different choices represents a different point of view: the Semitic or the pagan, which means to say that the state cannot choose between these alternatives without sacrificing the very principle of state neutrality. However, the Kantian dictum, that the \u0026lsquo;ought\u0026rsquo; logically implies the \u0026lsquo;can\u0026rsquo;, generates the following valid theorem: the \u0026lsquo;cannot\u0026rsquo; logically implies the \u0026lsquo;ought not\u0026rsquo;. This means that the Indian state ought not to be neutral with respect to religious conversion in India because it cannot be neutral.\nThe above statement is odd, to put it mildly. We can bring the \u0026lsquo;oddness\u0026rsquo; to light by formulating it as a logical statement: with respect to religious conversions, if a liberal state ought to remain neutral, and if the Indian state ought to be a liberal and neutral state, then the Indian state can be neutral. However, the Indian state cannot be neutral on this issue. Therefore, either (a) a liberal state ought not to remain neutral or (b) the Indian state ought not to be liberal and neutral or (c) both. We can eliminate the choices (a) and (c) rather quickly: the obligation of state neutrality with respect to religious conversion is a cornerstone of liberal political theory. Consequently, there is only one choice left: with respect to religious conversions, theories of state neutrality oblige the Indian state not to be liberal and neutral.\nThe validity of the above argument requires that at least one of the following is true. (a) The relation between \u0026lsquo;ought\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;can\u0026rsquo; is one of logical implication; (b) some particular interpretation of the notions \u0026rsquo;liberal\u0026rsquo; and \u0026rsquo;neutral\u0026rsquo; leads us to the above conclusion. Some logicians differentiate between \u0026rsquo;logical\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;deontological\u0026rsquo; implications, and suggest that the Kantian dictum is about deontological implication.[23] Consequently, one reason for the \u0026lsquo;oddness\u0026rsquo; might have to do with the confusion between logical and deontological implications. Nevertheless, it is an empirical truth that theories of state neutrality have hitherto obliged the Indian state not to be neutral. The post-independent Indian state implemented a series of reforms to \u0026rsquo;the Hindu religion and its law\u0026rsquo;, while it did not interfere with Islam and Christianity.[24] This suggests that some interpretation of \u0026rsquo;neutrality\u0026rsquo; and \u0026rsquo;liberalism\u0026rsquo; is at stake here. We think this to be the case. Theories of state neutrality that interpret this notion to mean neutrality of justification force us to compromise the notion of a neutral and liberal state. Such interpretations either generate odd conclusions or try to defend indefensible positions.\nNeutrality of Justification\nAndrew Mason formulates an often made distinction between two kinds of state neutrality as follows:\nNeutrality of justification requires that the state should not include the idea that one conception of the good is superior to another as part of its justification for pursuing a policy. Neutrality of effect, in contrast, requires that the state should not do anything which promotes one conception of the good more than another, or if it does so, that it must seek to cancel or compensate for these differential effects.[25]\nIs it possible for the Indian state to have a neutral justification of its policy towards conversion, if we assume that it permits religious conversion as a part of the freedom of religious expression? Could it justify this choice in a neutral manner? As we have seen, in order to decide about conversion, the Indian state has to make four choices. If it chooses between them, it chooses for some specific conception of the good, whether pagan or Semitic. Then there is no possibility of neutrality of justification. However, if there is a possibility for the state to suspend its judgement about the truth-value of the statements, then it can play the agnostic with respect to the choices and remain neutral. In other words, could the state plead truth-indeterminacy with respect to these choices?\nIn a very trivial sense, it is possible to play the agnostic because one could plead ignorance with respect to the truth-value of any knowledge-claim. However, if the state pleads ignorance on some issue, it cannot legislate about the same issue. It cannot play the agnostic and feign ignorance about the question as to whether or not religion revolves around truth, for this would imply it cannot even begin to legislate about the phenomenon of religious conversion. Ignorance about a phenomenon can never be a grounds for legislation, since one would not even know what to legislate about. Any legislation regarding religion presupposes some knowledge about this phenomenon. Where it concerns the issue of religious conversion, the knowledge on the basis of which one legislates will inevitably contain either a denial or a confirmation of the claim that religion is a matter of truth.\nThe Indian state has made provisions in its constitution about the freedom of religion that includes the issue of conversion: Article 25 of the Indian Constitution states that \u0026ldquo;all persons are equally entitled to freedom of conscience and the right freely to profess, practise and propagate religion.\u0026rdquo; This has generally been interpreted to mean the following: \u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip;n the context of secularism and religious pluralism conversions are legitimate, well within the Constitutional provisions, and entirely a personal affair of the citizens\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;[26] From this, it follows that the Indian state has taken a stance on these issues. It endorses the belief that religion revolves around doctrinal truth.\nMore proof is available. The secular state in India and elsewhere puts certain legal restrictions on religious conversion. Most importantly, it prohibits all forms of coercion in conversion. It says that religious conversion can take place by means of persuasion alone. But if one takes conversion from one religion to another to be a matter of persuasion, one must presuppose that religion involves the question of doctrinal truth. One can be persuaded to convert only in so far as one accepts the truth of one religion as opposed to the falsity of another. Therefore, the secular state\u0026rsquo;s restriction on religious conversion again reveals it has taken a position on the question whether or not religion is a matter of truth. It may not accept the truth claims of any one particular religion, but it does assume that religion revolves around truth claims. This conclusion shows that the failure to be neutral towards the issue of conversion is not specific to the Indian secularists. It is a general malfunction of the neutrality of the model of liberal secularism. Even when its theorists take a critical attitude towards proselytisation, they reproduce the theological assumption that religion revolves around truth and therefore support a principle of religious freedom that entails the freedom to convert.\nThe Liberal State and Religious Truth\nAdmittedly, not all forms of liberalism—e.g. John Stuart Mill\u0026rsquo;s advocacy of liberty—emphasise the necessity of state neutrality. Therefore, one cannot conflate liberalism and neutrality. But all forms of liberalism do agree that a state should not base its policies in any one religion, because this would violate principles such as religious liberty and the equal rights of all citizens. In the case of conversion, it appears the liberal state cannot but implement a policy which either presupposes Semitic theology or the pagan stance towards religion and tradition. Hence, it will fail to grant equal rights to all citizens, since the notion of religious liberty itself is disputed. To one group, it implies the freedom to convert; to the other, freedom from conversion. Could not the Indian state merely subscribe to the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion as proclaimed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and follow the examples of the western democracies? Surely, one could argue, what works for the western democracies should also work for the Indian polity.\nLooking at the theory and practice of state neutrality in the European democracies, we can say the following. In principle, a state can be atheistic, theistic or agnostic, and yet remain liberal and neutral. As long as people enjoy the freedom of religious expression (used in the broadest sense here), and all religious groups are treated symmetrically, it does not matter much what the sovereign or the constitution declares the state to be. Of course, one might prefer an agnostic state to an openly atheistic or theistic state, but that cannot automatically lead us to question the neutrality of the state. Therefore, one could say that a symmetric treatment of all religions and the freedom of religious expression of the citizens are necessary conditions for the existence and functioning of a liberal state.[27]\nMore important for our purposes is the prevailing agreement. While a theist admittedly believes in the truth of his religion, the atheist believes that no religious claim is true. The agnostic suspends judgement about the truth-value of specific religious claims because of a confessed epistemic inability to ascertain their truth. Despite their differences, they share the premise that religion involves the question of truth*.* This is a factual premise of the liberal state. That is to say, the very possibility of a state being neutral with respect to religions hinges on the issue of whether or not religions involve the question of truth. In other words, although the liberal state ought not to make decisions about the truth of religions, it must decide whether religion itself is a matter of truth. We claim that the western liberal, neutral states have historically so decided.\nWhen Christianity underwent divisions (to speak only of western Christianity), the Catholics and the Protestants came up with competing truth claims. They defined the terms of the debate as a discussion about true and false religions. Islam and Judaism do the same as well. Whether they accuse each other of being false religions or merely that the others are deficient in worshipping (the Biblical) God, the point is that each of them advances the claim that their beliefs are true. Further, as histories tell us, this way of framing the issue retained its stability when they met with traditions elsewhere: Judaism and Christianity called the Roman religiones false; Islam and Christianity did the same with respect to the Hindu traditions many years later. A liberal state can remain neutral with respect to the competing truth claims of each and every of these religions. That is, the notion of state neutrality can be made sense of by saying that where there are competing \u0026rsquo;truth claims\u0026rsquo;, one does not assume a pro-stance with respect to any one of them. However, this does not preclude the liberal state from accepting that religion is a matter of truth. The western democracies have accepted this position, as history testifies.\nThe claim that religion is a matter of truth is not an epistemological thesis about the beliefs present in different religions. Instead, it is a theological meta-claim advanced by each of the Semitic religions about itself. When each is convinced that it is the truth and the rest are false, and each of them explicitly states that the difference between truth and falsity constitutes the difference between salvation and damnation, then each one of them is asserting not only that its beliefs are true but should also be so believed. And, therefore, that religion is a matter of either truth or falsity. The liberal state in the West has accepted a Semitic theological meta-claim as its factual assumption. It is able to play the agnostic with respect to the truth-value of religious claims because it shares the Semitic beliefs about religions.\nCould not a liberal state be \u0026lsquo;agnostic\u0026rsquo; with respect to the issue of truth itself? At first blush, it seems as though such a possibility exists. However, what does it mean to say that a liberal state ought to be an agnostic with respect to the issue of truth? It could mean that the state is unable to say which of the competing religions is true. Such an attitude presupposes that the state believes that \u0026rsquo;truth\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;falsity\u0026rsquo; are sensible predicates with respect to religion. As we have said, this is Semitic theology and there is nothing neutral about it. Alternately, it could mean that the state does not take a stance with respect to the issue whether religion itself is a question of truth. In that case, how does the state respond to the issue of conversion, and the \u0026lsquo;freedom\u0026rsquo; to proselytise? The only option, if the state wants to play the agnostic, is to remove the entire issue from the sphere of legislation and let the communities decide about it. But then the state can neither interfere with religious violence nor strive to reduce religious conflict. Such a state will have to remain \u0026rsquo;neutral\u0026rsquo; with respect to religious violence and religious freedom. Because the western liberal democracies endorse religious toleration and legislate about the issue, quite obviously, they are not playing the agnostic. As we said, they cannot be playing the agnostic because they have presumed that religious truth is cognitive in nature, and that, for example, coercion is not the way for a religion to persuade people of its truth.\nConsequently, the Indian state cannot merely follow the example of western democracies and hope to remain \u0026rsquo;neutral\u0026rsquo;. It cannot play the agnostic and yet legislate about religious freedom. It confronts choices, which the western democracies never had to face.\nThe Secular State and Religious Violence\nThe framers of the Indian constitution took over the theory of liberal state as it emerged in the West and tried to transplant it into the Indian soil. In the process, they also endorsed the theological claim that religion is an issue of truth. While such a stance makes sense in a culture where the problem of religious tolerance arises because of the competing truth claims of the Semitic religions, it does not do the same in another cultural milieu where the pagan traditions are a living force. Consequently, the Indian state is subject to contradictory demands. It must look at the Hindu traditions the way the Semitic religions do, as we have argued, while simultaneously playing the \u0026lsquo;agnostic\u0026rsquo; with respect to the issue whether religion itself is a matter of truth. The first impels it to legislate on the issue of conversion; the second compels it to remain \u0026rsquo;neutral\u0026rsquo; and let the communities decide. The first stance results in violence generated and sustained by the state; the second stance forces the involved communities to solve this problem on their own. The first attitude results in forcing the interaction between the Semitic religions and the pagan traditions to take the form of religious rivalry; the second forces the state to withdraw.\nLet us begin with the colonial state, whose foundations are also those of the modern Indian state. An unremitting hostility towards the Hindu traditions sustained the colonial state. Its legislations were meant to curb the superstitions and the cruelty \u0026lsquo;inherent\u0026rsquo; in Indian heathendom. Spinning the state policy around the Protestant-Christian criticisms of the Indian religions, the colonial state created stories about the \u0026lsquo;priests\u0026rsquo; of the Indian religions, the nature of Hindu temples, the reactionary role that Indian \u0026lsquo;religions\u0026rsquo; played in the evolution of Indian society and such like. The colonial representation of India, which was fundamentally a Protestant description of India, became the guiding mantra of the \u0026lsquo;secular\u0026rsquo; politicians of India. Nehru\u0026rsquo;s withering contempt for the Hindu traditions does not come from his \u0026ldquo;discovery of India\u0026rdquo; but from the textbook stories of the colonial power. As he said himself, he came to India via the West to some extent, and therefore he approached her \u0026ldquo;almost as an alien critic, full of dislike for the present as well as for many of the relics of the past that saw.\u0026quot;[28] The intention and effects of his description could be summarised as systematic attempts to uphold the claim that the Hindu traditions are degenerate, corrupt and in need of transformation. In other words, it upheld the Semitic claim about the inferiority of false religion and therefore wanted \u0026ldquo;to scrap much of past heritage.\u0026quot;[29] The secularism of Nehru and his followers was, quite simply, a negative attitude towards the Hindu traditions. There is nothing \u0026rsquo;neutral\u0026rsquo;, in any sense of the word, about the Nehruvian \u0026lsquo;secular\u0026rsquo; state.\nWhen pursued systematically, such policies are bound to have their impact on society. Eventually, once the seduction of this \u0026lsquo;secularism\u0026rsquo; wore off, the representatives of the Hindu traditions began to articulate defence of their own traditions. However, this defence did not take the form of reflections on Hindu traditions and their ability to address the problems of modern society. Instead, it took the inevitable form of defence against attacks, i.e., a militant defence of the Hindu traditions against the \u0026lsquo;secular\u0026rsquo; state of the Nehruvian variety.\nWhen looked at from a pagan perspective, there is no religious rivalry between the Hindu traditions and the Semitic religions. However, the opposite is the case when viewed from the perspective of the Semitic religions. When the Indian state assumes the truth of a Semitic theological claim, and further accepts this claim as its own epistemological position, then it actively creates and promotes the religious rivalry between the majority (i.e. those who belong to the Hindu traditions) and the minority (i.e. those who are Muslims and Christians). That is to say, the state creates religious rivalry where there is none (if viewed from the majority perspective). As a matter of state policy, it creates and sustains opposition between religions and traditions. Consequently, it transforms the conflict between different groups into a religious conflict.\nIn his introduction to an important collection of articles on secularism in India, Rajeev Bhargava writes that many critics of the secular state have reached the following conclusion:\nThere is perhaps as much, if not greater religious bigotry today than before. Religious minorities continue to feel disadvantaged and often face discrimination. The scale and intensity of religious conflict does not seem to have declined: if anything it has proliferated, touching people who have never known it before. The verdict against secularism appears unequivocal: it failed to realize the objectives for which it was devised.[30]\nWe disagree with this verdict. The secular state provides a ready-made dress into which social tensions between groups in a society can legitimately fit. The secular state in modern India assumes the truth of a religious perception (even if the perception is that of the minority) without submitting such a perception to any kind of scrutiny. The exacerbation of religious violence does not tell us that secularism failed in India. Its intensity tells us that secularism has been entirely successful in India. The secular state, which the secularists continue to wish for, does not prevent religious conflicts: it actively promotes them.\nBy forcing the framework of the Semitic religions on the Hindu traditions, the \u0026rsquo;liberal\u0026rsquo; state in India is also coercing the communities to solve their internal conflict in a religious manner. That is to say, it is forcing the pagan traditions in India to mould themselves along the lines of the Semitic religions. The growth of the so-called Hindu fundamentalism is a direct result of this coercive straitjacket. Traditions, which never systematically persecuted the other on grounds of religious truth, are forced into a systematic persecution of religions precisely on this basis. When secularists fight \u0026lsquo;Hindu fundamentalism\u0026rsquo; by appealing to liberal theory, they feed and strengthen what they intend to fight. It is precisely a liberal \u0026lsquo;secular\u0026rsquo; conception that generates the phenomenon of \u0026lsquo;Hindu fundamentalism\u0026rsquo; in the pagan Indian culture.\nToleration as a Harbinger of Conflict\nNaturally, this theoretical claim requires empirical support also. We will develop an empirical argument in the near future; within the confines of this article we can only sketch its outlines. The British colonial state in India saw religious toleration as one of its basic duties. In 1858, the Queen of England proclaimed the following:\nFirmly relying ourselves on the truth of Christianity, and acknowledging with gratitude the solace of religion, we disclaim alike the right and the desire to impose our convictions on any of our subjects. We declare it to be our royal will and pleasure, that none be in anywise favoured, none molested or disquieted, by reason of their religious faith or observances; but that all shall alike enjoy the equal and impartial protection of the law.[31]\nInspired by the values of toleration and religious liberty, the colonial state argued that Hindus ought to be left free in the spiritual realm of religion, in the same way as the believers in Europe. No human being, said the principle of Christian freedom, could arrogate the authority of God over human souls and consciences.\nThe resulting policy, however, systematically compelled the Hindus to prove that a particular practice was founded in \u0026rsquo;the true religious doctrines of Hinduism\u0026rsquo;. This was the case, because the liberal colonial state would tolerate a practice only if it had been demonstrated to belong to the realm of religion. Thus, in the nineteenth-century controversy over the practice of sati or \u0026lsquo;widow-burning\u0026rsquo;, the Governor-General in Council decided in 1812 that \u0026ldquo;The practice…being…recognized and encouraged by the doctrines of the Hindoo religion, it appears evident that he course which the British government should follow, according to the principle of religious toleration…is to allow the practice in those cases in which it is countenanced by their religion…\u0026quot;[32] In the same controversy, a British observer commented that \u0026ldquo;the true interpretation of the religious law…will no doubt diminish, if not extinguish the desire for self-immolation. The safest way of coming to a right understanding on a point so interesting to humanity, is a rigid investigation of the rules of conduct laid down in the books which are considered sacred by the Hindoos.\u0026quot;[33]Consequently, the orthodox Hindu community began to aggressively defend the practice of self-immolation by demonstrating its foundation in the \u0026lsquo;religious doctrines\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;sacred texts\u0026rsquo; of the \u0026lsquo;Hindu religion\u0026rsquo;.[34]\nFollowing this route, the policy of religious toleration gradually transformed the self-confidence and vibrancy of the Hindu traditions into a fanatical defence of their alleged \u0026lsquo;religious doctrines\u0026rsquo;. Before the early nineteenth century, the Hindu spokesmen had protected their traditions from the missionary onslaught by pointing to the antiquity of their ancestral practices. Or they insisted that \u0026ldquo;every one may be saved by his own Religion, if he does what is Good, and shuns Evil,\u0026rdquo; as a Malabar Brahmin told Ziegenbalg in the early eighteenth century.[35] This changed once the liberal colonial state implemented its policy of religious toleration: now these traditions had to prove that they were proper religions, with their own sacred doctrines, in order to be legitimate. In the same way as its colonial precursor, the secular state of post-independence India has forced the Hindu traditions to identify and stand up for themselves as religious doctrines—variants of Islam and Christianity. The result is the Hindutva movement: a militant attempt to establish the doctrines of \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; as the superior and dominant form of religion in the Indian society.\nEven though it is incomplete, this argument points to a common mistake in the current analysis of \u0026rsquo;the world-wide phenomenon of religious fundamentalism\u0026rsquo;. As argued in the above, the contemporary liberal framework assumes that the Hindu and other Asian traditions are variants of the same phenomenon as Islam and Christianity, viz. religion. In the same way, the current analysis presupposes that all cultural movements in the contemporary world can be classified into two basic categories: the liberal tolerant movements and their counterparts of religious fundamentalism. When one assumes that all the movements in question—Islamic fanaticism in the Arab world, Christian fundamentalism in the United States, the Hindutva movement in India, violent Buddhist groups in Sri Lanka—are variants of one and the same phenomenon, one\u0026rsquo;s analysis and research projects will indeed confirm that we confront a worldwide threat of \u0026lsquo;religious fundamentalism\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;religious violence\u0026rsquo;.[36] However, this does not give us a fruitful understanding of these various movements. It merely shows how the fallacy of petitio principii allows one to uphold a crude conceptual framework, which reduces all cultural movements into variants of either liberal pluralism or religious fundamentalism.\nWe propose a first step towards an alternative understanding of the so-called \u0026lsquo;Hindu fundamentalism\u0026rsquo; in India. When the Indian liberal state accepts the Semitic notion of human traditions as so many competing religious doctrines (which enables it to grant the freedom to convert), and does nothing more, the pagan traditions are forced to defend their value of non-interference by reacting to those who interfere with them. That is to say, when the state actively promotes only the Semitic conception of the good and the pagan communities want to strengthen their conceptions of the good, a conflict between the two is inevitable. This conflict is not only between the pagan communities and the state but also among the communities in society. To the extent that some one particular type of community—namely, those belonging to the Semitic religions—is perceived to enjoy the protection of the state, the conflict could only take the form of opposing the state violence with civic violence. That is to say, the so-called religious violence between communities and the cry to ban religious conversion arise from the \u0026rsquo;neutral\u0026rsquo; \u0026lsquo;secular\u0026rsquo; policies of the Indian state during the last fifty years or more. The seeds of religious violence are sown by the liberal state; however, it is the communities that harvest them.\n3. Can the Indian State be Neutral?\nDoes all of this mean that state neutrality is impossible in the Indian society? This depends on the kind of neutrality one strives for. It has become clear that a neutrality of justification is logically impossible for the Indian state. This option is not available because (a) the choices of the state are logically exclusive and (b) the state cannot play the agnostic. However, other conceptions of state neutrality exist: neutrality of effect and neutrality of aim, for example. Drawing on Joseph Raz\u0026rsquo;s formulations of state neutrality, the foremost liberal political theorist of the twentieth century, John Rawls, suggests that neutrality might mean any of the following:\n(1) that the state is to ensure for all citizens equal opportunity to advance any conception of the good they freely affirm; (2) that the state is not to do anything intended to favour or promote any particular comprehensive doctrine rather than another, or to give greater assistance to those who pursue it; (3) that the state is not to do anything that makes it more likely that individuals will accept any particular conception rather than another unless steps are taken to cancel, or to compensate for, the effects of policies that do this.[37]\nWhen it legislates in favour of religious conversion, the Indian state cannot live up to the first two principles of neutrality of aim. This policy promotes \u0026rsquo;the comprehensive doctrine\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;conception of the good\u0026rsquo; of the Semitic religions at the expense of the Hindu traditions by making the four choices that correspond to the Semitic view. This leaves the third option of neutrality of effect. But this, Rawls claims, is \u0026ldquo;an impracticable aim,\u0026rdquo; because\nit is surely impossible for the basic structure of a just constitutional regime not to have important effects and influences on which comprehensive doctrines endure and gain adherents over time, and it is futile to try to counteract these effects and influences, or even to ascertain for political purposes how deep and pervasive they are. We must accept the facts of common-sense political sociology.[38]\nThus, the effects of state policy in a liberal regime may well bring about the decline of some religions and their conceptions of the good. We may indeed lament the limited space of social worlds, Rawls continues, but \u0026ldquo;No society can include within itself all forms of life.\u0026quot;[39] Rawls has in mind cases of minority religions that go against his conception of political justice: e.g. conceptions of the good that require the repression or degradation of certain persons on racial or ethnic grounds or religions that need the control of the state apparatus in order to survive. The predicament becomes somewhat more dramatic in the Indian case. Here, if we accept \u0026ldquo;the facts of common-sense political sociology\u0026rdquo; (whatever these may be) and abandon neutrality of effect as \u0026ldquo;impracticable,\u0026rdquo; then it simply becomes impossible for the Indian state to be neutral. Neutrality of effect is the only option left for the liberal state in India in the face of the predicament of religious conversion. If it continues its current policy without trying to neutralise the effects, the cultural traditions that do not conceive of religious diversity as a rivalry over truth will continue to decline.\nHow could the Indian state neutralise the effects of its policy towards religion and conversion? Such a strategy becomes conceivable when we consider a common description of the co-existence among different religious and cultural traditions in the Indian society. Many authors have claimed that a reasonably stable and plural society existed in India, which far surpassed the cultural diversity of the West at any point during its history. This phenomenon of pluralism, it is said, took a shape different from anything known to modern western culture. There were violent clashes, but these never developed into the systematic persecution of some particular tradition or the other. Alongside these clashes, there was a tendency in each of the religious traditions to absorb or adopt elements from the other traditions. Certain saints, festivals and artistic traditions were shared by Hindus, Muslims and Christians. In many parts of India, scholars point out, this kind of positive interaction lives on today.[40]\nIt remains to be seen how far this picture of traditional Indian pluralism will correspond to a social-scientific theorizing of the same phenomena. It could be pure nostalgia or a naïve conception of societies where Hindus really set the basic rules and compelled others to comply. That is what research will have to show us. Anyway, our contemporary ignorance of the nature of—and the mechanisms behind—this pluralist social structure is tragic, given the fact that it is in fast decline. Social-scientific research should examine the successes and failures of stable diversity in the Indian culture. This research can reveal the mechanisms behind the traditional forms of pluralism and show how they could be stimulated. One thing the Indian state could do in order to neutralise the effects of its policy towards religion is to promote such research projects. It could help create a fertile soil for innovative research into the Indian cultural traditions, including Indian Islam and Indian Christianity, so as to disclose the mechanisms and dynamics that could be stimulated in order to have the Indian pluralism flourish.\nIn other words, only by actively generating the neutrality of effects could the Indian state hope to become neutral. To give up religious freedom and ban religious conversions is both undesirable and retrograde. It would deny freedom to those groups in India who follow the Semitic religions. Instead of doing this, the Indian state could look elsewhere to become neutral. In response to the economic exigencies of the global market, it has actively stimulated the growth of engineering and allied disciplines. It could do the same with respect to stimulating explorations into the histories and theories of the Indian cultural traditions. The state could make career prospects in such areas exciting, and entice intelligent minds to explore the possibilities of cultural rejuvenation.\nAt this point, a common misunderstanding may emerge. Let it be clear that we are not in any way suggesting that political structures and processes in India should become \u0026lsquo;faith-based\u0026rsquo;, \u0026rsquo;theocratic\u0026rsquo;, or \u0026lsquo;religious\u0026rsquo;. This understanding of our argument commits a fallacy: it assumes that because we criticise the notion of a liberal secular state in India, we intend to defend its mirror image of a religious or faith-based state. This is neither a logical implication nor a hidden agenda of our argument. Rather we wish to challenge the entire framework of liberal political theory on conceptual grounds. This framework first makes all cultural traditions into variants of a common phenomenon of religion. Then it tends to reduce all political models to an opposition between the impartial and secular versus the partial and religious ones. We contest the framework at two levels. Firstly, in spite of its pretention of neutrality, the liberal model of toleration and state neutrality is itself not a secular, impartial model. In reality, it is a Semitic theological entity which has been dressed up in \u0026lsquo;secular\u0026rsquo; philosophical garb.[41] Secondly, the prima facie evidence indicates that the Hindu traditions cannot be variants of the same phenomenon as Islam and Christianity. Hence, the suggestion that an attempt to examine the traditional pluralism of the Indian culture as the source of a potential alternative to the liberal model of toleration is equivalent to the advocacy of faith-based politics misses the point. We do not intend to study the Hindu traditions as a religious doctrine or faith, because this approach captures neither their basic nature nor their distinct structure.[42]\nUltimately, it is not the aim of our argument to prescribe to the Indian state what it should or should not do. We do not even propose that the Indian state is under a moral obligation of neutrality towards the various cultural and religious communities in its society. What we have argued is that the dominant notion of state neutrality of liberal political theory threatens to collapse once it is confronted by a case like the Indian, where pagan traditions and Semitic religions co-exist. The issue of religious conversion shows that neutrality of justification and aim are logically impossible in such a case. Naturally, neutrality could still be possible with regards to different issues. But the fact that the liberal secular state fails to be neutral in an issue as crucial as that of religious conversion indicates that we should re-examine its success while dealing with other problems of the Indian society also—e.g. its controversy about a uniform civil code.\nIn so far as the normative theory of the liberal state intends to provide a universal model to solve the problem of diversity in society, it is bound to fail, for it suffers from a profound ignorance of the structure of plural societies other than those of the Christian West. Moreover, our analysis has revealed that the dominant conception of the liberal state—\u0026rsquo;neutral\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;secular\u0026rsquo;—does not allow space to pagan traditions, which do not conceive of religious diversity as a rivalry of truth claims. Perhaps, as Rawls says, no society can include within itself all forms of life. But when the epistemic premises of the liberal state prevent it from accommodating cultural traditions that form the majority in many Asian countries, it is high time to re-examine the cultural roots and limitations of this particular form of life.\nReferences\nApffel-Marglin, Frederique. 1999.

[17] This Christian understanding of the Hindu traditions lives on today. During an oral evidence given before the members of the Select Committee of the House of Lords on Religious offences in November 2002, Ramesh Kallidai, speaking on behalf of the Hindu Community, pointed out an article by the Christian Medical Fellowship\u0026rsquo;s Pastor Juge Ram: \u0026lsquo;There is another example which I recently came upon which may not be incitement to religious hatred, but in our opinion it is vilification and ridiculing the Hindu belief system. This is an article published in July 2000 by the Christian Medical Fellowship and the article was written by Juge Ram who is a convert from Hinduism to Christianity and I quote from his article which was published July 2000 and is at present on their web site. The article says as follows: \u0026lsquo;Hindus are lost and spiritually blind. They are without hope in this world and in the next. Only Christ can release them. Hinduism is a false religion\u0026rsquo;. So in our humble opinion we think this is definitely vilification and ridiculing one billion Hindus worldwide who are established in a particular religious system\u0026rsquo; (italics added). Responding to this statement, the Earl of Mar and Kellie, a member of the Select Committee, said \u0026lsquo;Following on the question about the Christian Medical Fellowship, it struck me from what you read out was that they were just making unpleasant statements, to put it mildly, but they were not actually telling any lies about the Hindu religion in the sense that they were not actually putting out any false remarks which were possibly going to distort people and mis-educate them.\u0026rsquo; The Minutes of the Select Committee of The House of Lords on Religious Offences in England and Wales – First Report, (http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/ld200203/ldselect/ldrelof/95/ 2112706.htm; italics added; consulted August 8, 2004).

In reality, it is a Semitic theological entity which has been dressed up in ‘secular’ philosophical garb\u0026rsquo;\nInteresting. So, the Secular State seeks, if not an interlocutor, then an alterity which looks like itself- i.e. a parallel bureaucracy but whose domain is the sacred- and \u0026lsquo;Liberty\u0026rsquo; only arises, as for Lord Acton, where there is pluralism in this regard. Jefferson\u0026rsquo;s famous remark-\u0026rdquo; religious freedom is the most effectual anodyne against religious dissension: the maxim of civil government being reversed in that of religion, where its true form is \u0026ldquo;divided we stand, united, we fall.\u0026rdquo;- though addressed to the Jews had an application to the splintering Protestant sects of the dominant community and can be read as broadly supporting your thesis.\nI find myself wondering how this squares with your policy recommendation- viz. \u0026lsquo;In response to the economic exigencies of the global market, it has actively stimulated the growth of engineering and allied disciplines. It could do the same with respect to stimulating explorations into the histories and theories of the Indian cultural traditions. The state could make career prospects in such areas exciting, and entice intelligent minds to explore the possibilities of cultural rejuvenation.\u0026rsquo;\nLeaving aside my sense of shock and indignation at your suggestion that some Sarkari initiative could possibly identify let alone \u0026rsquo;entice\u0026rsquo; intelligent minds, that too, to explore the possibilities of \u0026lsquo;cultural rejuvenation\u0026rsquo;, as opposed to emigration or suicide, the problem here is that Govt. policy instruments aren\u0026rsquo;t plastic and can\u0026rsquo;t directly impact something essentially inchoate, decentralized and \u0026lsquo;pagan\u0026rsquo;. The British subsidised madrasas and patshalas and this contributed to, if not the reality , then at least the appearance of, \u0026lsquo;organized religions\u0026rsquo; as an interlocutor. But this broke down because the thing wasn\u0026rsquo;t desirable in the first place and became a motivating factor behind the Freedom Struggle. It meant things like keshadari Sikhs being considered the clients, if not spiritual subjects, of Udasi mahants; Satpanthis being considered the subjects of the Aga Khan, and absurd situations e.g. Vaikom agitation where only Hindus are prohibited from using a road but become free to do so the moment they convert. True, the British recognized that customary law held greater force than Smriti, but between 1860 and 1930, case law was going in the other direction creating a sense of crisis for even the comprador sub-castes. Gandhi and Azad, in their different ways, further muddied the waters. Azad, at least, had some notion of becoming the Imam-ul-Hind and did know Arabic, but poor old Gandhi , even if he shared a similar ambition, had no such qualifications. Still, at that time , Sanskritization of vernaculars could appear to be a sop to the Brahmins and Persianized Urdu a pandering to the Ashraf. Mandalization has removed that possibility for Hinduism while Muslim elites have now wholeheartedly embraced \u0026lsquo;Convent School\u0026rsquo; English. So how is your Policy recommendation to be implemented? Grant more scholarships, expand Univ. Depts, and you end up with a bunch of Witzel worshipping, Pollock spouting careerists. Just as our IITs and Medical Colleges ended up subsidizing America and Europe through \u0026lsquo;brain drain\u0026rsquo;, so too does treating Hinduism as an academic subject. Similarly money for \u0026lsquo;Ayurveda or Yoga or whatever means just more land-grabbing by Baba Ramdev types. Pruning back the State, on the other hand, and getting rid of compulsory indoctrination in a Conspiracy theory of history in school and, later, for aspiring Civil Servants might be a step forward.\n","tags":[],"title":"The Secular State and Religious Conflict: Liberal Neutrality and the Indian Case of Pluralism","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/the-secular-state-and-religious-conflict-liberal-neutrality-and-the-indian-case-of-pluralism/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","enlightenment","Indian traditions","intentionality","knowledge","published"],"content":"Editor\u0026rsquo;s note: This article appeared in the Journal of American Academy of Religion\nAbstract\nThe paper attempts a contrast between the process and the structure of the Christian and the Indian spirituality. Drawing attention to their dissimilarities, it attempts to reformulate the differences among the Indian traditions in a novel way. It argues that cultures and traditions are not just different; but that they differ from each other in different ways as well. The future of religious studies, it is suggested, is dependent on developing the ability to develop new ways of describing the differences between cultures and traditions. This is the agenda for the future. As a correlate to this task, the paper suggests that we replace the question \u0026ldquo;who speaks \u0026lsquo;for\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;about\u0026rsquo; a religion?\u0026rdquo; with a more pregnant and a more accurate reformulation: \u0026ldquo;how to speak for a religion in the Academy?\u0026rdquo;\nIn the course of the last decade or so, an increasing disquiet seems to reign in the discipline of religious studies. The conference on Contested Religions and Religions Contested is both recognition of and an attempt to address the issues, if not to redress the situation. In the overview to the project that has led to the present conference, the organizers formulate one of their concerns as follows:\nQuestions are … being raised that concern the role of scholarship and scholars themselves in the attempt to understand religions today. Increasingly it is clear that notions of religion developed in the colonial context of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries are being challenged both by those interpreted through those ideas and by scholars from around the world who are calling for new descriptive and analytical categories …. What and who have been neglected and distorted by scholars\u0026rsquo; ideas of religion?\nHailing from such interpreted traditions, viz., the Indian traditions, I do believe there is an urgent need for developing new descriptive and analytical categories. In fact, it will be the primary burden of this paper to suggest that the Indian traditions have been hitherto presented in a distorted form and that more adequate theoretical tools than what we possess today need to be fashioned. However, the organizers of the conference are not likely to give their assent to this proposal without asking searching questions about who should undertake such a task. Indeed, as they formulate the issue explicitly, who has the authority to speak for or about religions? A workshop panel on the \u0026lsquo;The Politics of Representation\u0026rsquo; sharpens this question further: \u0026ldquo;Are there legitimate and illegitimate ways of speaking \u0026lsquo;for\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;about\u0026rsquo; a religious tradition or religions? Who determines these, and how?\u0026rdquo; In other words, it appears as though one cannot simply argue for developing new ways of describing different religions and traditions without, at the same time, tackling the issue of who does any of these things. Consequently, in this paper, I will try to do both and here is how I plan to do it. In the first section, I will very briefly locate the multiple sources of this double question and confine myself to making some general remarks. In the second, third and fourth sections, I provide thumbnail sketches of an alternative description of the Indian traditions. This enables me to make clear what has been distorted by the scholars\u0026rsquo; notion of religion. In the concluding section, I reflect upon the agenda for the future of religious studies.\nI\nLet me begin with the \u0026lsquo;who speaks for…\u0026rsquo; question in rather general terms first. Quite obviously, this issue has preoccupied many people in the field of religious studies. The discussions about the \u0026lsquo;insider/outsider\u0026rsquo; problem are familiar to most of us. Equally familiar is the urgency, which the post-colonial writers have brought to the theme by underwriting the relation between knowledge and power in such discussions. While one can resonate to the concerns behind the \u0026lsquo;who speaks for…\u0026rsquo; question, it is with disfavor that I look upon such a general formulation.\nThree threads have coalesced here. First, there is the issue whether one has to be religious in order to speak about religion. Second, there is the correlate to this issue with respect to specific religions. Third, there is the problem about the relation between representation and power.\nDoes one have to be religious in order to study religion? Many people have answered this question in the affirmative. This has invited rejoinders to the effect that in order to study neurosis, one does not have to be a neurotic any more than one has to be a stone in order to describe its fall. While true, these facile analogies miss the central difference: religion includes what it says about itself. The Bible is a book, to be sure. However, if one studies it for what that book is to the believers, one cannot overlook the claim it makes about itself, viz., it is the word of God. One cannot bracket this claim away and still study the Bible in order to understand Christianity as a religion. If one does this, one does not have religion as the object of study anymore. To accept the claim, however, is to accept theology as the \u0026lsquo;science\u0026rsquo; of religion. While this dilemma cannot be discussed any further here (see Balagangadhara 1994 for an exhaustive argument), the point remains: if one wants to study religion, one has to accept what religion says about itself because it incorporates what it says about itself.\nDoes one have to be, say, a Christian in order to study Christianity? To the extent we study Christianity as a religion, the above point holds. Christianity, however, is more than merely a religion: it is also an ecclesiastical organization, a movement of people, a set of theological claims, and so on. To study or criticize any of these aspects, one does not need a party card. In this sense, belonging to a religion is not like having the right to attend the shareholder\u0026rsquo;s meeting of an organization or like being a member of the Central Committee of a Communist Party, which entitles you to speak for the political party.\nIt is true to point out that the so-called world religions have been historically associated with centers of political, economic and social power. Do these collusions tell us something fundamental about religions? They do not; unless, that is, one has a theory that can spell out what relations, if any, exist between the properties that make some phenomenon into a religion and these centers of power. Of course, we might learn much by studying religion also as a sociological, political and economic phenomenon. However, surely, that does not tell us why we would want to call, say, the Catholic Church a religious organization and not a civil or a political association. Studying the complicity between the Pope and an authoritarian regime could tell us much about the Pope or even the Catholic Church as a power center. Nevertheless, it does not tell us what Catholicism is, any more than it tells us why Catholic Christianity is a religion. In other words, no matter how interesting such empirical studies might be, in the absence of a theory about religion and, say, politics, there is not much mileage in the claims about the relation between knowledge and power. Currently, we do not even have the vague promise of such a theory.\nDo these general remarks suffice to write off the concerns behind the question \u0026lsquo;who speaks for…?\u0026rsquo; They do not. The underlying worry is also about the nature of portrayals of non-western religions and cultures. Scholars of religions have failed to provide us with adequate accounts of traditions and religions from other cultures. In fact, one of the reasons for the \u0026lsquo;who speaks for…\u0026rsquo; issue has to do with the flawed representations we have today.\nAt the least, that is what I think. Speaking from within my area of expertise, it is my conviction that the Indian traditions have not been adequately described and that there are fundamental flaws in the current descriptions. The agenda for the future, as I see it, is to begin the process of developing different ways of describing the differences between cultures and traditions. However, I want to make this general point by focusing on the Indian traditions and organizing the next three sections around two reference points: a problem often identified as the \u0026lsquo;Aristotelian\u0026rsquo; question; and an imagery of routes and their description.\nII\nOn an Aristotelian Question\nLet me begin with the following question: \u0026lsquo;how should I live?\u0026rsquo; Depending upon who is raising this question, whether a teenager or a middle-aged man, it is susceptible to at least two interpretations and, as a consequence, allows of at least two possible answers. To the teenager, it would be an answer to say, \u0026rsquo;live as an ethical being\u0026rsquo;. At this stage, it is irrelevant what force the word \u0026rsquo;ethics\u0026rsquo; carries – whether \u0026rsquo;normative\u0026rsquo; or \u0026rsquo;non-normative\u0026rsquo;. The same answer would probably infuriate the middle-aged person: his question lies \u0026lsquo;beyond\u0026rsquo; the ethical. Probably, he is saying something like this: \u0026ldquo;To the extent possible, I have tried to lead an ethical life. I have undergone many experiences in life. I am now struggling to \u0026lsquo;make sense\u0026rsquo; of these experiences. I am increasingly at a loss to cope with all my projects, ambitions, dreams, desires, success and frustrations. How should I live from now so that I may reconcile these forces, passions, attitudes etc. with each other?\u0026rdquo;\nAs a matter of fact, the real Aristotelian question is the one the middle-aged man asks. For Aristotle, the answer to this question constitutes the \u0026rsquo;ethical domain\u0026rsquo;. A search of eudaimonia (loosely translated as \u0026lsquo;happiness\u0026rsquo;) is undertaken only after undergoing some experiences in life. That is why, to Aristotle, a moral agent is an \u0026rsquo;experienced\u0026rsquo; person:\n… (A) young man is not a proper hearer of lectures on political science; for he is inexperienced in the actions that occur in life, but its discussions start from these and are about these; and, further, since he tends to follow his passions, his study will be vain and unprofitable, because the end aimed at is not knowledge but action. And it makes no difference whether he is young in years or youthful in character; the defect does not depend upon time, but on his living and pursuing each successive object as passion directs. For such persons, as to the incontinent, knowledge brings no profit; but to those who desire and act in accordance with a rational principle knowledge about such matters will be of great benefit.1\nThere are three of points worth noting in the above citation. The opposition is not between \u0026lsquo;reason\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;passion\u0026rsquo;: one can pursue any passion (fame, wealth, power, etc.) in a \u0026lsquo;rational\u0026rsquo; way. After all, modern-day industries use market research, advertising campaigns, and theories of management to pursue their goal of making profit in a \u0026lsquo;rational\u0026rsquo; way. So can an individual. Rather, it is a contrast between directing all one\u0026rsquo;s abilities in order to acquire an object and \u0026rsquo;thoughtfully acting\u0026rsquo; or \u0026rsquo;thinkingly-doing-something\u0026rsquo;, where action is brought under the scope of thoughtful considerations.2 The second point is that even those \u0026lsquo;who are old in years, but young in spirit\u0026rsquo; (a compliment these days, which has the status of a norm about how one ought to grow old!) are not considered \u0026lsquo;fit\u0026rsquo; to receive instructions in ethics. Their \u0026lsquo;defect\u0026rsquo; is that they too pursue objects as \u0026lsquo;passion\u0026rsquo; dictates. That is to say, they too cannot pose (or understand) the question of Aristotle, viz., how one should live. The third point is that ethical discussions begin with \u0026lsquo;actions in life\u0026rsquo;; they are reflections about these actions; the goal lies in the acquisition of an ability to act (thoughtfully). Modern philosophers have attributed the notion of \u0026lsquo;contemplative life\u0026rsquo; to such a conception that has action as the end product! \u0026lsquo;Living a life thoughtfully\u0026rsquo; glosses such a notion more accurately than \u0026lsquo;vita contemplativa\u0026rsquo;.\nOur middle-aged man is, thus, raising the question of Aristotle. \u0026ldquo;I have pursued many things in life. I have acquired wealth and status, and aimed with varying degrees of success to become powerful and famous. I have been successful in some of my endeavors, while failing in yet others. I thought these things would make me happy, but I discover that, apart from moments when I felt \u0026lsquo;good\u0026rsquo;, these projects have only made me unhappy. What should I do? How should I live?\u0026rdquo; Today, these questions are not a part of ethical enquiry, any more than a quest for eudaimonia is: at best, these are the \u0026rsquo;esoteric\u0026rsquo; questions and quests of \u0026rsquo;exotic\u0026rsquo; religions;3 at worst, one raises them with one\u0026rsquo;s psychoanalyst during a \u0026lsquo;mid-life crisis\u0026rsquo;. This situation should already indicate the distance between what is called an \u0026rsquo;ethical enquiry\u0026rsquo; today, and what Aristotle thought was the subject of all such enquiries. But that is not the focus of this piece now. However, there is no need to confuse matters by continually drawing the distinction between \u0026lsquo;modern\u0026rsquo; ethics and \u0026lsquo;Aristotelian\u0026rsquo; ethics. So, let us follow the contemporary consensus and call the quest of our middle-aged man \u0026lsquo;spiritual\u0026rsquo; (from now on without scare quotes). Seeking spirituality, and not having found it in those objects that he once so passionately pursued, he is now raising a spiritual question: in fact, he is undergoing a spiritual crisis.\nCould one outline the structure of such a crisis? Using a terminology quasi-accepted by most of us, I would like to do that regarding two traditions: the western Christian religion and the Indian traditions. The terminology should indicate both the similarity and the difference between the ways the traditions from the West and India structure such a crisis. Let me begin with the Christian religion.\nA problem confronts us straight-away. What is the relation between Christian \u0026lsquo;religiosity\u0026rsquo; and the Christian \u0026lsquo;spirituality\u0026rsquo;? The question involves many things. On the one hand, it asks for a clarification of the terms \u0026lsquo;spirituality\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;religiosity\u0026rsquo; within the context of the Christian religions. On the other hand, it also involves a normative discussion about religion: are today\u0026rsquo;s religions adequate to meet the \u0026lsquo;spiritual\u0026rsquo; needs of the modern man? Has the (Catholic) Church today lost the \u0026lsquo;spirituality\u0026rsquo; it once had and become a mere organized religion instead? And so on. I am not interested in the normative discussion. But I will (partially) tackle the question of the relation between \u0026lsquo;spirituality\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;religiosity\u0026rsquo; within Christianity.\nA Christian Religious Loop\nLet me begin with a medieval monk. There are several reasons for this choice as a starting point. Firstly, there are quite a few works dealing with medieval religiosity (including autobiographies and hagiographies) that can be fruitfully used in this context. Secondly, one can contrast my outline with the processes that such works portray in order to identify deficiencies in my sketch. Thirdly, one can extend such a sketch to the modern-day world as well: many people (like Söderblom, for instance) have left enough material behind them for us to pursue this line of enquiry without getting caught in the normative discussion about what a religion ought to be. Fourthly, thereafter, we can see whether the modern man has \u0026lsquo;spiritual needs\u0026rsquo; too, the way he is alleged to have \u0026lsquo;religious needs\u0026rsquo; as well. For all these reasons, let me begin with the medieval monk.\nAs a deeply religious person, this monk believes that man is a sinner but God loves him nonetheless. He believes too that one could experience the infinite love of God if only one opens up one\u0026rsquo;s heart to God\u0026rsquo;s grace. In a way, you could say, he believes them as \u0026rsquo;true propositions\u0026rsquo;. He does not yet appreciate their depth, or their true meaning, because he has not quite experienced what they seem to say. This is how he embarks on his quest: because he knows them to be true (this is his faith), he wants to experience this love \u0026lsquo;first hand\u0026rsquo;. So, he begins a process of fasting, prayer, study of the scriptures, and whatever else his monastery prescribes. After some suitable length of time, he discovers that no matter how hard he tries, he does not experience God\u0026rsquo;s love for him. Anxiety begins to gnaw: why does he not have this experience when the scriptures, the saints, some fellow-brethren, all assure him that it is real? Is he not sincere enough? Does he not try hard enough? Is he approaching it the wrong way? Are his sins too great for God to forgive them? The soothing words of the Abbott, that the monk too shall experience this love if only he \u0026lsquo;opens himself up authentically\u0026rsquo;, instead of comforting him, transform his anxiety into downright panic: because no matter what he does, he does not have that experience.\nThe monk now enters a loop: the more he tries, the less successful he is. The less successful he is, the harder he tries. Each circuit through this loop increases the stress, and that merely makes the subsequent traversing of the loop even more stressful. Very soon, this loop opens up another loop within itself. The monk begins to doubt whether he will ever find God\u0026rsquo;s love. However, to entertain this doubt is to doubt the truth of the scriptures. Believing in the scriptures is leading him experientially to doubt the truth of the scriptures. His faith assures him that he too shall experience God\u0026rsquo;s love; his experience makes him doubt whether he ever will. (This is the second loop.) Now the monk is undergoing what could properly be called a spiritual crisis: he has begun to doubt the words of the Holy Spirit. It is important to note that the monk does not doubt whether the Holy Spirit exists or whether his faith in this entity is misplaced. If he doubted this, he would be undergoing a crisis of faith. As a man of faith, it does not even occur to the monk to doubt the Holy Spirit. On the contrary. His spiritual crisis occurs precisely because of his faith. That is to say, a spiritual crisis occurs within the confines of a faith and within the parameters set by the latter.\nThe spiritual crisis suggests to the monk that the reason why he does not find God\u0026rsquo;s love is to be located in his \u0026lsquo;state of mind\u0026rsquo;. His state of mind assures him that his sins are too great: he has even begun to doubt God\u0026rsquo;s love for him. His faith tells him that this is his greatest sin and confirms what he knows: the Devil is sowing these seeds of doubt (about God\u0026rsquo;s Word) in his mind. Thus, he tries harder; prays that God rescues him from the clutches of the Devil. He is filled with self-loathing and self-disgust for not being able to resist the Devil and \u0026rsquo;truly believe\u0026rsquo;. The intensity of travelling through the loops increases, the stress and tension grows, the pitying looks in the eyes of his brethren become more noticeable, until, one day, the inevitable happens: he suffers an absolute, total and complete nervous breakdown, the price for getting caught up in an unending loop.\nThe Christian Spirituality\nLet us notice the \u0026lsquo;psychological\u0026rsquo; transformations he has undergone in the process of suffering the nervous breakdown. Firstly, his sense of agency is shattered. He is unable to do the many things he could do with consummate ease before. Perhaps he is even unable to take care of his personal hygiene; he starts crying for no apparent reason. He flies into uncontrollable rages; perhaps, cannot stop eating or drinking. In short, he realizes that he has no control over himself, while he previously thought he had. Secondly, because of this realization, his vanity is shattered. All his \u0026lsquo;urges\u0026rsquo; are sins, and he cannot control them. The Devil can do what he wants with this monk and he is powerless to stop Him, something the scriptures and his religion always proclaimed. Thirdly, his sense of value is shattered: he now realizes that all men are sinners like him, and he is the worst sinner of all. In its wake, his sense of worth is shattered as well: he is more loathsome than the crawling worm and the poisonous insect; at least, they are not tainted by sin the way he is.\nIn this situation, in the depth of despair and self-disgust, there is still hope for him because he is a man of faith. The monk knows from the scriptures that God has proclaimed His love for the humankind and sent down His only son to save them. This realization is, perhaps, the most shattering of all: how can God love such sinners as this monk, and promise to save them? Such a love cannot simply be conceptualized, and the monk is dumbstruck by it. The monk is not worth it, this he knows in his heart, and yet, in His infinite mercy, God promises to save him. At last, he understands (from the bottom of his heart, so to speak) why God\u0026rsquo;s grace is incomprehensible and infinite.\nIt is this realization that opens the floodgates. His heart is filled with what he was looking for: God\u0026rsquo;s love. God was always present; the monk went through the purgatory in order to emerge purer of spirit and stronger of faith. He starts recovering from his breakdown, and finding God\u0026rsquo;s love is crucial to this process. He now \u0026lsquo;discovers\u0026rsquo; God\u0026rsquo;s grace, and finds out why it is called the healing grace of God. Indeed, this experience starts to heal him, and in the reconstitution of his personality, these elements are never far away. Our monk has had a spiritual experience, and he will perhaps end up becoming another example of those touched by God. Just for the sake of convenience, and only for its sake, one could also put it this way: if the monk was a religious person before, after his experience he has become a spiritual person as well. In this process, our monk realizes that his earlier \u0026lsquo;failure\u0026rsquo; to discover God\u0026rsquo;s grace was not, strictly speaking, a failure at all. It is only thus, and no other way, could he open himself up to be filled with God\u0026rsquo;s love.\nPerhaps the above picture is a bit too Augustinian, but, as an illustration, it should do. What I want to get at in this picture is the fact that his religion steers the monk in a particular way, sets up a loop, generates a breakdown, and helps him emerge out of it with the means to reconstitute his personality that is more in consonance with itself. Needless to say, the community (that the monk is a part of) plays a significant role both in steering him towards a breakdown as well as help him recover from it. In general terms, the path of the monk is that of \u0026lsquo;conversio\u0026rsquo; but he will truly understand its meaning as he starts recovering and assumes his duties. It is a process of turning himself inside out, an asymptotic process, the completion of which is not possible through human hands and human efforts.\nFrom the above hypothesis it does not follow, firstly, that all monks underwent (or undergo) this entire process. No teaching process can make all the students learn the same thing in exactly the same way. A differential learning is an inescapable fact for all teaching processes. This is ever truer for a teaching process that works upon and (trans)forms the experience of its students. Secondly, it does not follow that this \u0026lsquo;spirituality\u0026rsquo; is only to be found among the monastic orders. There is no reason why some of the laity cannot undergo a similar process outside the confines of a monastic order. However, it is highly probable that one finds significantly more \u0026lsquo;spiritual experiences\u0026rsquo; within the ambit of the monasteries than outside it.\nA Loop in the Indian Traditions\nHow could we conceptualize such an event (or process) in the Indian culture? I would like to begin with the questions of the middle-aged man, and locate him within the Indian culture.4 Because of his location in the Indian culture, its resources open up to him in his attempts to pursue answers to these questions.\nThe first and the most important thing about the resources of the Indian traditions is the assurance they give him: what the person seeks, call it eudaimonia (or \u0026lsquo;happiness\u0026rsquo;) till a more appropriate term is introduced, can be found. Not only has the person heard about the indefinitely many people who have found eudaimonia, but also knows that there exist indefinitely many traditions that claim to teach the path leading to it as well. Perhaps, he even sees people who have sought and found what he himself is looking for. In other words, he knows before he undertakes his quest that his questions have answers and that they can be found. All he has to do is try.\nThus he begins his quest. Very quickly it is obvious to him that what he seeks is not to be found in the outside world, but inside him. A period of \u0026lsquo;introspection\u0026rsquo; is initiated and, after a suitable length of time, the person comes to the conclusion that introspection does not help. Not only is such a process equivalent to entering a bottomless pit but his \u0026lsquo;internal life\u0026rsquo; is also as varied, rich and complex as the world outside him. The answer, in other words, is not found in the inside either.\nNow the loop gets set up: the answer is neither inside nor outside him. But it can only be in one of these two \u0026lsquo;places\u0026rsquo;. Perhaps, his \u0026lsquo;introspection\u0026rsquo; was not done the right way; maybe he did not look hard enough; perhaps he was not sufficiently perceptive. Be it as that may, he starts traversing the loop: from the inside to the outside; from the outside to the inside. Each journey through the loop increases the tension: why does he not find it, when others have? What is he missing? What does he not see? His tradition assures him that he too can find the answer. What should have been a fruitful search seems to culminate in a fruitless movement through the loop.\nBy now, the tension has become unbearable. He does not know what he is looking for, but he knows that \u0026lsquo;it\u0026rsquo; is there to be found. Clearly, he is missing the obvious, but the obvious refuses to \u0026lsquo;reveal\u0026rsquo; itself to him. Despair sets in, helplessness overpowers him, and he even wants to stop searching because he has exhausted himself. None of this works; his journey on the loop becomes more intensified, fed further by his day dreams of the answer occurring to him in a \u0026lsquo;flash\u0026rsquo; or of a kind \u0026lsquo;guru\u0026rsquo; guiding him in this process. Knowing that the answer is \u0026lsquo;obvious\u0026rsquo;, but not finding that which is apparently so \u0026lsquo;obvious\u0026rsquo; deepens the loop. There is one predictable end to this loop as well: a total and complete nervous breakdown.\nExperiential knowledge and the Indian Traditions\nMuch like the medieval monk, this middle-aged person too experiences a shattering of his sense of agency, but here all further similarities cease. The reason lies in how this shattering is further experienced and what it consists of. To the middle-aged man, this experience comes as a \u0026lsquo;revelation\u0026rsquo;: it is as though a cloak is lifted from his eyes and he is looking at the world for the first time. He realizes that he was never an agent, even though he always thought he was one. His breakdown provides him with this knowledge, and he recognizes it as such because of his tradition. He is now enlightened, and if he pursues this path, he pursues the path of enlightenment. He sought eudaimonia, and he has found it in knowledge.5 Even though many people had repeatedly spoken of the same \u0026lsquo;knowledge\u0026rsquo; from his tradition, it did not appear to help him before his quest began. That is because this knowledge is of another type: it is an experiential knowledge that involves his situation.\nIn other words, this person realizes that all his endeavors, projects, dreams, desires and frustrations were never really \u0026lsquo;his\u0026rsquo;. His unhappiness arose not because these projects were pursued, but because he thought they were \u0026lsquo;his\u0026rsquo;. He has still to work out many things: whose projects were they, if they were not \u0026lsquo;his\u0026rsquo; projects? Why and from where did he have the experience of being an agent? etc. The important point here too is that the Indian tradition steered the middle-aged person in a particular way, helped him set up a loop, and generated a breakdown. The middle-aged man must now emerge out of it, and use his insight to reconstitute his personality in a way that is in consonance with his experience.\nReligiosity and Spirituality\nVery often, \u0026lsquo;religious experience\u0026rsquo; is described in terms of states that are typical of all breakdowns: the \u0026lsquo;feeling\u0026rsquo; of insignificance, worthlessness, and such like. What is wrong with these descriptions is that they describe a religious experience as a set of \u0026rsquo;emotions\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;feelings\u0026rsquo;: resulting from something else (e.g. gazing up to a starry night in a meadow) or as a state of mind (\u0026rsquo;epiphany\u0026rsquo;, for instance). My story of the medieval monk provides a different picture: a religious experience includes the path travelled and the path to traverse. It is a particular way of experiencing (oneself and the world); the particularity of the way cannot be specified without speaking about how one has come to a particular \u0026lsquo;point\u0026rsquo; and where one is going thereafter. What we choose as a significant unit of experience in order to elucidate the religious experience is merely a \u0026lsquo;point\u0026rsquo; on this path. It does not, however, provide a description of the religious experience itself and, as such, is arbitrary if taken to stand for religious experience as such. One could take any other \u0026lsquo;point\u0026rsquo; on this path as well. A spiritual experience is part of such a religious experience.\nIn other words, there is a distinction between religiosity and spirituality. The latter is the subset of the former: spirituality is a particular kind of religious experience. While one could be religious without being spiritual, it is not possible to be spiritual without being religious. This distinction requires to be more carefully worked out than I can in the confines of this paper. Because nothing in my argument revolves around this distinction, I will leave this problem aside.\nHowever, there is another distinction that is more crucial to this paper: the difference between the Indian traditions on the one hand, and a religion like Christianity on the other. I have exhaustively argued (see my 1994) that if Christianity, Judaism and Islam are religions, then the Indian culture does not have any native religions. That is to say, entities like Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, etc. are not examples of the category \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo; the way the Abrahamic religions are. I am not presupposing these arguments in this paper, but elucidating the differences in yet another way. The goal of Indian traditions is to enable the practitioner to achieve \u0026rsquo;enlightenment\u0026rsquo;.6 Let us see how this is different from the end result of the Christian Monk.\nThe experience of enlightenment in the Indian tradition is fundamentally dissimilar to the religious or spiritual experience. The middle-aged person\u0026rsquo;s insight into the nature of agency breaks radically with the experience of daily life. It tells him that his experience of daily life is something of an illusion and, by doing so, reorganizes the way his experience was structured hitherto. But this restructuring does not tell him how he should go further, or what he has to do next. Enlightenment involves a restructuring of the travelled path, but says nothing about the path to traverse. In so far as the middle-aged man still has a future, all he can do from now on is act thoughtfully, and, in this process of thinkingly-doing-something, try to sustain and develop his insight further. What does this \u0026rsquo;thinkingly-doing-something\u0026rsquo; mean? It means constantly attending to his insight in all his future endeavors. In the language of Nichomachean Ethics, the middle-aged man has acquired an ability to act thoughtfully and he has acquired it by gaining an insight (knowledge). In other words, our middle-aged man has found eudaimonia.7\nDoes it mean that similar quests always require a breakdown of the people who undertake such a journey? After all, nervous breakdowns have nothing heroic or romantic about them; they are always sordid and messy affairs. Besides, the outcome is unpredictable. Yet, with respect to Christianity, my answer is a qualified \u0026lsquo;yes\u0026rsquo;. It is my impression that the Catholic and the Protestant religions are far more inclined to induce a breakdown than the Indian culture. My impression is based on some reasons. Firstly, it is my belief that my description of \u0026lsquo;religious experience\u0026rsquo; closely tracks what is called the religious experience in the Christian tradition. Secondly, I believe that the monastic orders appear to have developed methods to induce a spiritual experience. While it is undeniable that a spiritual quest in the Christian religions could be undertaken successfully without a messy experience, it is my guess that one will find significantly more spiritual persons with such an experience than those without it. Thirdly, perhaps more importantly, there is very little satisfactory reflection about spiritual experience within Christianity. Its nature has not been conceptualized enough.8 In a way, such a situation stands to reason: how do you conceptualize either God\u0026rsquo;s infinite Grace, or His unbounded love? What can you say about the experience of your heart being filled with His love for you and mankind? One may wax eloquent, or live like a saint; neither helps in reflecting about this experience. The \u0026lsquo;mystics\u0026rsquo; in the Christian tradition speak a language that only fellow-mystics can understand, and their reflections are not helpful to the non-mystic. Perhaps, that is the reason why spiritual experiences have something mysterious about them; such people appear to have been \u0026rsquo;touched by God\u0026rsquo;, as it were.\nDo the Indian traditions induce nervous breakdowns in individuals on a quest to enlightenment? The answer is in the negative: they do not. While such breakdowns can and do happen, the energy of the Indian traditions have been focused towards teaching and guiding individuals towards enlightenment without such an experience. Using many different strategies, the Indian traditions mould the experience in such a way that the insight of the middle-aged man can be taught without inducing a nervous breakdown. As we have seen, the middle-aged person\u0026rsquo;s insight was that he was never an agent. Paraphrasing Aristotle, let me \u0026ldquo;start with this experience, and discuss about this experience\u0026rdquo;.\nEnlightenment and Plurality in the Indian traditions\nOne possibility of understanding his experience is to say that he was never an agent (nor could he be one) because there are no agents. This is the answer, for example, of the Buddhist traditions. I say \u0026rsquo;traditions\u0026rsquo;, because there are several ways of understanding the absence of agency. One could say there is no agency at all and that the experience of agency is totally illusory. (This is the \u0026lsquo;doctrine\u0026rsquo; of anatta.) Or one could say that acts give birth to an illusory \u0026rsquo;experience\u0026rsquo; of agency. To understand the illusory nature of this experience requires an insight into the relation between the organism and the actions.9 These different accents roughly indicate in the direction of the different traditions in Buddhism.\nThe second possibility lies in taking the insight in another direction: Who is the \u0026lsquo;he\u0026rsquo; who realizes that \u0026lsquo;he\u0026rsquo; was never an agent and all agencies are illusions? \u0026lsquo;Whose\u0026rsquo; illusion was it, and why did \u0026lsquo;he\u0026rsquo; succumb to this illusion? When these questions arise, a new \u0026lsquo;interiority\u0026rsquo; opens up that is different from and other than the internal mental life. That is to say, the middle-aged man discovers that there is a difference between his persona and \u0026lsquo;himself\u0026rsquo;. Here too different possibilities open up. Either the person discovers that the \u0026lsquo;he\u0026rsquo; cannot be a particular, because particularity is a property of the organism and the persona. In that case, he is heading towards the Advaita traditions. Or he could experience the particularity of the \u0026lsquo;he\u0026rsquo; in a different way than the particularity of the persona: in that case, he could head either towards the Jain traditions or towards the Dvaita traditions.\nThe third possibility is this: the illusion lay in the fact that the middle-aged person thought that he was the agent, while he never was. Actually, someone else is the Agent and this agent is acting through the middle-aged person all the time. The middle-aged person now sees his role as a conduit, and no more than that. Now, we approach the various Bhakti traditions.\nReligions and Traditions\nEven though I began the paper by putting both the Christian monk and the middle aged person in an analogous situation, their evolution, as we have seen, diverge in fundamental ways. Even the destinations of their journey appear different. I would like to suggest that this is one of the parameters for outlining the differences between entities like Hinduism; Buddhism, Jainism, etc. on the one hand and religions like Christianity on the other. There is a difference in kind between these two sets of entities. What one needs to do in the field of religious studies, to the extent that one speaks about an agenda for the future, is to not only say more clearly what the differences are but also theorize the implications of these differences. Let me continue to spell out some other differences of import between Indian traditions and religions like Christianity.\nIII\nEarlier on, when I located the middle-aged man in the Indian tradition, I did so only to provide him with the means to set up a breakdown. What would be the nature of his insight if he belonged to a particular tradition? That is, how would he experientially understand his insight if he was, say, a Buddhist? The reason for this question should be obvious. If Buddhism, Jainism, Hinduism, the Bhakti traditions, etc. were all to be religions, there would be a great difficulty involved in the migration of \u0026lsquo;doctrines\u0026rsquo; across religions.10 To what extent would the Buddhist enlightenment be \u0026lsquo;different\u0026rsquo; from the advaitic enlightenment? Given what I have said so far, such a differentiation does not make much sense: because they are experiential insights, it is not possible to differentiate them \u0026lsquo;doctrinally\u0026rsquo;. However, it might be possible to postulate such a divide when one starts providing further explanations for these experiential insights. Therefore, let me take a \u0026lsquo;Buddhist formulation\u0026rsquo; of an explanation: attachment to the worldly things and events is at the root of the illusion that we are agents. Let me look at the several ways in which this \u0026rsquo;explanation\u0026rsquo; could be recuperated by the different Indian traditions. I will do that by suggesting that the differences between these entities can be re-described in a different way: it makes no reference to the doctrine, but speaks of the activity instead.\nRecuperating the Differences\nOne way encourages an unremitting reflection and analysis of the experience of being an agent. Who acts? What is acting? In what does the attachment consist of, except the feeling of \u0026lsquo;I\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;mine\u0026rsquo;? What are these two terms? Is the \u0026lsquo;I\u0026rsquo; the same as this body, or this organism, or this persona? Does the sense of \u0026lsquo;I\u0026rsquo; undergo change and development as the organism or the persona undergoes change and development? If not, what is the relation between the \u0026lsquo;I\u0026rsquo; and the other two? This is the path of knowledge (Gyana) that changes the nature of experience by correcting it.\nAnother way of reaching the same insight is to go deeper into experience. Any attachment requires constancy: of the object or the event one is attached to, and of the \u0026lsquo;agent\u0026rsquo; who is attached. The deeper one delves into locating this constancy in experience, the more one discovers discontinuities and inconstancies. One discovers that neither the \u0026lsquo;structures\u0026rsquo; of experience nor their \u0026lsquo;constancy\u0026rsquo; are given in experience. Rather, they are provided by the descriptions of the said experience. This would be the meditative path to such an explanation. By relocating the subordinate units of the daily experience, the meditative path (Dhyana) restructures it.\nThe third way of achieving the same insight is to notice that \u0026lsquo;attachment\u0026rsquo; is also a particular human emotion. To be unattached requires an altering of this emotion. One can do that using other kinds of human emotions as \u0026lsquo;meta-emotions\u0026rsquo; directed towards emotional attachment. Attachment to objects, events, and persons are seen as situations a person is caught up in. Ironical and humorous descriptions of such situations enable the person to achieve a sense of distance from those situations; compassion and sorrow, directed towards the situation of suffering caused by attachment will help loosen the hold of the emotion of attachment. Music, rhythm, cadence, dance and poetry (in combination) work on generating such sets of \u0026lsquo;meta-emotions\u0026rsquo;. This is the devotional path (Bhakti) to such an insight. This path restructures experience by altering the force of emotions invested in such experiences.\nA fourth way of achieving the same insight is to try and severe the relation between action and its outcome. Attachment can also be seen as the experience of relating action to its outcome and claim that one is the fruit of the other. One decouples actions from human intentions, and such a decoupling can be achieved by building reflexivity regarding action and \u0026lsquo;its\u0026rsquo; intention. One acts \u0026lsquo;observantly\u0026rsquo;, observing both the nature of action and \u0026lsquo;its\u0026rsquo; alleged intention, only to discover that \u0026lsquo;intentionality\u0026rsquo; is no \u0026lsquo;property\u0026rsquo; of the \u0026lsquo;agent\u0026rsquo; at all. This is the action path (Karma) to the insight. This path transforms the daily experience by severing the relation between human action and human \u0026lsquo;intentionality\u0026rsquo;.\nConsider how a fifth way would approach this insight. Whatever one experiences, there is but one means through which one experiences: through the organism that one\u0026rsquo;s body is. Consequently, one can also begin to understand what experience is by experimenting with the experience itself. One way of doing that is to begin manipulating experience, begin assembling and reassembling it. One\u0026rsquo;s body is not only the means through which experience is possible but it is also the instrument to experiment on experience itself. That is, the focus shifts to the body, its sense organs, and such like in order to understand what the \u0026lsquo;insight\u0026rsquo; is. This is the Yoga path to further the insight.\nThus one could go on. But my purpose is served. One could differentiate the Indian traditions on the basis of their \u0026lsquo;doctrines\u0026rsquo;; equally, one could differentiate them according to the activities they encourage; one could do both and graft doctrines or activities onto each other. All these possibilities indicate that the activity of \u0026lsquo;distinguishing\u0026rsquo; the Indian traditions from each other is classificatory in nature: why one chooses one way of doing it and not another way depends upon one\u0026rsquo;s purposes for wanting to classify them. It also suggests that one\u0026rsquo;s ability to classify depends upon the categories one brings to bear in the study of these traditions. To suggest that \u0026lsquo;Buddhism\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; are two different religions and that their doctrinal differences are crucial to this divide is not a claim about the structure of the world. Instead, it is a claim about one\u0026rsquo;s classificatory scheme.11\nThe above point is important enough for us to linger a bit longer. When scholars come up with stories about the \u0026lsquo;religions\u0026rsquo; that exist in India and the differences between them, mostly the belief is that they are making claims about the nature of Indian culture and her traditions. That is what the intellectual world has believed so far as well. This situation is understandable: one knows that one has merely classified the world in one particular way, only when one comes across alternate methods of classifying the same. Until such time, one believes that one\u0026rsquo;s classification mirrors the structure of the world. That is the case with the students of Indian traditions as well.\nIf so, it is obvious that the debates about \u0026lsquo;who speaks for…?\u0026rsquo; question become more than a bit irrelevant. If what one calls \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;Buddhism\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;Jainism\u0026rsquo;, etc. have more to do with one\u0026rsquo;s classificatory scheme than with the structure of the Indian culture and the nature of her traditions, what exactly does one ask for, when one raises the question, \u0026lsquo;who speaks for Hinduism?\u0026rsquo; or Buddhism, or whatever? What would constitute answers to these questions? This situation should further indicate to us that something is seriously wrong with these kinds of queries.\nMultiplicity of Teaching Methods\nBe it as that may, let us continue. I have provided thumbnail portrayals of (some of) the paths based on a very summary description of a single insight. The only purpose of this exercise is to demonstrate the heuristic productivity of this approach in capturing the diversity within the Indian tradition. That can be highlighted by further showing that this approach captures disputes among these traditions as well. From the description I have given of these paths, it is obvious that each is present in the other: reflection on experience cannot be undertaken without emotion; poetry and music without thought are impossible; one cannot go deeper into experience without thinking about experience; reflexivity without thought and emotion is impossible, etc. In other words, the practitioners from each of these paths are likely to have disputes with the others that their way is superior because it incorporates other paths as well. Such is the case in India. Such disputes are also productive: they generate newer ways through cross-fertilizations. Techniques and strategies migrate and the diversity in the tradition increases. Such an end-result is both necessary and desirable: no particular teaching process can teach every individual in the same way and to the same extent. The presence of a multiplicity of teaching methods can only increase their total efficacy.\nWhat kind of teaching methods am I talking about? Let me answer this question by looking at how the teaching methods have \u0026lsquo;segmented\u0026rsquo; the phases in learning. Because a teaching method can teach only if it dovetails with the process of learning, it is of importance to know how they steer the process of learning. Broadly speaking, there are three phases to this learning process: (a) the process of listening or reading; (b) the process of analysis and achieving insight; (c) the process of contemplation. (Even here, a thumbnail sketch will have to do.)\nThe first phase appears quite straightforward. To the questions the middle-aged man raises, different traditions provide different answers. One listens to or reads these answers, reflects about them so that one grasps the meaning of what is heard or read.\nThe second phase involves reflection and analysis of what is understood. It is also the process of making use of the analytical and cognitive skills one has learnt in order to draw inferences, formulate hypothetical answers, and test them out. This phase could also be called \u0026lsquo;internalization\u0026rsquo; of answers.\nThe subsequent phase is one of contemplation. One contemplates the insight achieved and observes its impact on experience. To do so, one has to learn new skills other than the cognitive skills one used in the previous phase. These new skills are achieved only by contemplating the internalized answer. There is nothing \u0026lsquo;circular\u0026rsquo; about this: one can \u0026lsquo;skilfully\u0026rsquo; do something only by acquiring the said skill; the only way of acquiring that skill is by doing it.\nHere too, one could say that the first two phases are really unnecessary. In fact, one might even find them counter-productive because in the third phase one has to think differently than in the previous two phases. As a result, one can develop a teaching process that further sub divides the third phase into successive stages and concentrate on teaching that. Zen Buddhists do precisely that; together with their meditative techniques, their koans are the means of teaching the ability to think without thinking about.\nThe refinements in these phases and the development of further techniques to successfully negotiate such phases; the inevitable migration and cross-fertilization of strategies; these add to the diversity in an already enriched landscape. By now it must also be clear that there is no need for any kind of a loop or breakdown. What is required is merely the presence of these teaching traditions in the culture.\nIt requires noting that I have continuously spoken of migration and cross-fertilization. That means to say that the strategies, techniques, and insights can migrate across different traditions and different paths. The Buddhist and the Dvaita are examples of different traditions; they do have their \u0026lsquo;own\u0026rsquo; identities. There is a divide between them too, but it is not a doctrinal divide. We need to conceptualize the difference between traditions in a different way than we do that with respect to philosophies or religions. The Buddhist insight about desire being at the root of sorrow is as much Upanishadic as it is Buddhist. It is an experiential insight not confined to specific traditions. Does that mean that such insights are true descriptions of the world, and nomenclatures like \u0026lsquo;Buddhist\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;Advaitic\u0026rsquo; etc. simply identify the origin of these truths? Einstein\u0026rsquo;s theory of relativity merely tells us that he formulated it in the first place. Is an analogous claim being advanced here? Not quite. I want to put across the claim that these insights are primarily guides to action and they are that in a particular way. These insights are rooted in experience and help you in its transformation. Even though such insights do have a descriptive role, they are not (in any straightforward sense) descriptions of the world. Let us see whether it is possible to make sense of this qualified claim.\nIV\nConsider two kinds of descriptions: a description of a route to a destination and a software manual. Both tell you what to do. One tells you of the routes you need to travel, whereas the other tells you what you can do with the software and how to do it. Both are combinations of instruction and description. The software manual tells you what steps to execute, and you can find out whether you have executed the right steps by recognising the description it provides of what you see on the screen. A similar point holds with respect to the description of a route: it tells you turn left and right, and then go straight. To find out whether you took the correct turns, you are provided with landmarks: \u0026lsquo;follow the road for 100 meters and then turn left at the petrol station\u0026rsquo; and such like. It is important to remember that such instruction manuals are useful to us, if we are not familiar with either the software or the route. The insights of the Indian traditions are partially like the software manual or a description of the route: they are guides in orienting ourselves in an unfamiliar territory. In the first place, they tell you what you see. We need remember that the \u0026lsquo;unfamiliar territory\u0026rsquo; refers to our individual experiences. In other words, they help us orient ourselves in the unfamiliar world of our own experiences.\nWhat is \u0026lsquo;unfamiliar\u0026rsquo; about our own experiences? Well, everything. The very \u0026lsquo;obviousness\u0026rsquo; of our experiences is a guarantee for its unfamiliarity. We have a certainty about our emotional states that goes far beyond any other kind of certainty we can imagine. When a person is angry, the person knows he is angry. No one can tell this person that he is confused about his emotions. Without any teaching, he knows what \u0026lsquo;anger\u0026rsquo; is, what \u0026lsquo;sorrow\u0026rsquo; is, etc. I do not mean that he has a \u0026rsquo;theory\u0026rsquo; about these emotions. What I do mean is that he \u0026lsquo;knows\u0026rsquo; when he is angry and when he is happy. That is to say, when they occur in him, he has the conscious ability to distinguish these emotions from one another. But how does he know he is angry? How does he know that he is not confusing \u0026lsquo;happiness\u0026rsquo; with \u0026lsquo;anger\u0026rsquo;? The very absurdity of these questions tells us that we are speaking of an entirely different kind of certainty. Not only that. That he is able to know he is \u0026lsquo;angry\u0026rsquo; and not \u0026lsquo;happy\u0026rsquo; will have something to do with the structure of these emotions. And yet, the person is unable to represent to himself what the alleged structure is. Our emotional worlds may be obvious to each one of us; but familiar, they certainly are not. That is why we need guidance in navigating ourselves in this world.\nA Metaphor of Route Description\nHow do these insights help us orient ourselves? Imagine there is a destination we want to reach. Imagine too that the territory is a circle and we want to reach its center. Let us say that it is a vast territory and indefinitely many descriptions of routes to the center are available. We do not know what is at the center; but we do know that there is a center to this territory. So, let us assume further that we pick up some description of the route at random and proceed. Like all such descriptions it tells us where to go, how to go, identifies what we see so that we may know where we are. Who can make sense of this description of the route? Those who are on that route, because it (partially) describes the landmarks on that particular route. Therefore, we can say that the role that the \u0026lsquo;route description\u0026rsquo; plays as a (partial) description of the world is strictly subordinated to its ability to guide you in that route. Its description is \u0026rsquo;true\u0026rsquo; only for that route and it is \u0026rsquo;true\u0026rsquo; only in so far as you are on that route and not on another.\nTwo crucial assumptions were made in the above paragraph: we had a place to reach, and we have an idea about the nature of the territory. Under these assumptions, the route descriptions become competitors: consequently, picking a route description at random (our third assumption) becomes an irrational choice. The rational choice would be to pick out the easiest and the most efficient route. We choose a description before we take a route, and we do that using the criteria of ease and efficiency. If we do this, it appears as though we need to forego the claim that route descriptions are \u0026rsquo;true\u0026rsquo; only for those on that route. However, one could argue that these criteria are still relativized to the individuals. (What is \u0026rsquo;easy\u0026rsquo; for one need not be the same for another and \u0026rsquo;efficiency\u0026rsquo; is relative to \u0026rsquo;ease\u0026rsquo;.)\nLet us now observe the following: some route descriptions claim that all other descriptions lead to the camp of the cannibals, and there exists only one route to the \u0026lsquo;palace\u0026rsquo;, which, they say, is your destination. That is, not only do they tell you what is at the center but also what happens to you if you do not choose the right route. Thus, we are provided with \u0026lsquo;objective\u0026rsquo; criteria for choosing between the competing route descriptions. These descriptions specify the nature of the territory, the goal of the journey, provide a complete description of the route, and tell you what happens if you are on the wrong route. Not just that. They specify that there is a time limit: if you do not reach the destination within a particular time (\u0026lsquo;before you die\u0026rsquo;), what awaits you is too horrible even to contemplate. The criterion of \u0026rsquo;efficiency\u0026rsquo; cannot now be relativized to the individual \u0026rsquo;ease\u0026rsquo; any more, but becomes very objective instead: the need to reach the destination before the time is up. Religions are such route descriptions. They tell you what to do, it is true, but through description and prescription. They too are \u0026lsquo;guides\u0026rsquo; to action but not the way the Indian traditions are.\nLet us, therefore, drop the assumptions that the territory is a circle, and that we want to reach its center. All we know is that we are on a journey. However, let us retain the assumption that we have route descriptions. Let us observe too that each route description assures us that it will bring us to \u0026rsquo;the\u0026rsquo; destination, and that there are no time limits. Now, we have very little to go by: how does one judge which route description to pick? In the first place, it depends on the individual: what \u0026rsquo;ease\u0026rsquo; means to him, how fast he wants to travel, how much he wants to enjoy the scenery, how many times he wants to set up camps, how hurried he is, etc. However, it does not mean that there is no reasonable ground for making a choice: in so far as one is already on a path, one chooses a route description that is best able to describe what one has already seen and what one is seeing currently. A route description that describes a mirage (and what to do about it) is of no use to me when I am in lush lands and facing a jungle.12 It is true that my experiences are (partially) moulded by the tradition I am born into; hence also my inclination to look at my own tradition first. Only when such a search fails do I cast around for other descriptions, which are closer to my experiences. In other words, the route description should make sense to the individual and it can do that only if it is a true description of his individual experiences. It is this claim that relativizes the \u0026lsquo;route description\u0026rsquo; to the individual and to the route he is on.\nOn the Nature of Indian Traditions\nHow is this description a guide to his actions? How does it differ from, say, a route description that a religion is? Just because a route description makes sense of the past and current experiences of an individual, it does not follow that it will continue to do so in the future as well. With respect to any given individual, as route descriptions, the Indian traditions are retrospective in nature: they succeed (or fail) in making sense of your past and current experiences only. They help you orient yourself only by telling you where you have come from and where you are currently. But in doing so, they also function prospectively: they encourage you to proceed thoughtfully on your journey. They continually ask what you see. Because you know you have been wrong in the past about the sights you saw, you are far more attentive to what you see now and what the route description says. Neither the \u0026lsquo;first look\u0026rsquo; (at the sight) nor the \u0026lsquo;first reading\u0026rsquo; (of the route description) is authoritative: you need to doubt both and test both with respect to each other. In other words, these route descriptions inculcate the ability to go-about the world experimentally. Your experiments involve your experiences of the world in a non-trivial way. The more a route description helps you in this, the more you trust the route description you have. Indian traditions are traditions in this sense. They are guides to action not because they tell you what to do in some circumstance but because they tell you how to go about doing whatever it is you do. You have to do it thoughtfully and experimentally. It is this ability that the Indian traditions teach.\nAs human beings we are pretty similar; as individuals we are unlike each other. What helps one person may or may not help another, and the experience of the one is definitely not the experience of the other. An individual born into a tradition is analogous to this. While his experience is (partially) moulded by the tradition he is born into, as an individual, his experiences are different from those of the other members. While following some particular route, he suddenly discovers that what he \u0026lsquo;sees\u0026rsquo; is not a palace but an oasis. Because nothing in his tradition helps him at that juncture (this is a \u0026lsquo;weakness\u0026rsquo; that all traditions share), he looks around for a description that tells him what he sees. He does find one such: but it speaks of a route that included rocky mountains and acres of sand before an oasis is encountered, whereas this individual has travelled only lush lands. A new tradition can now be born, one which also includes a route through the lush lands to the oasis. Traditions are like routes, and their insights are the retrospective route descriptions. There are indefinitely many routes, and the route descriptions can migrate and cross-fertilize as the routes cut across each other, or as individuals encounter \u0026lsquo;similarities\u0026rsquo;. The routes are divided; that is why they are different routes. Consequently, their route descriptions are also different. But all of them have only one function: to reach \u0026rsquo;the\u0026rsquo; destination. There is no way of telling, either beforehand or thereafter, which route is the best. All one can say is that one took this route, and that some (combination of) route descriptions worked for one.\nSummarizing: the insights of these traditions are not \u0026lsquo;doctrines\u0026rsquo; or even straightforward (partial) descriptions of the world. They are \u0026lsquo;route descriptions\u0026rsquo; relativized both to the route and to the individual on that route. Their role as (partial) \u0026lsquo;descriptions\u0026rsquo; of the world is strictly subordinated to the role they play as instructions for actions (in the sense I have just explained). Because of this, it is not possible to speak either about the truth or about the falsity of such traditions but only about whether or not some route description taught the individual to go-about the world experimentally.\nThe Current Situation\nImagine someone doing the following: take the descriptive elements from such \u0026lsquo;route descriptions\u0026rsquo;, abstract them from the routes, and try to present them \u0026lsquo;coherently\u0026rsquo; as a tract.\nWhen one travels 100 meters, one encounters a petrol bunk. A left turn at that corner brings a palace into view. Yet, someone else claims that when one travels 100 meters, one encounters a clump of trees. A left turn at the lake brings a desert into view. Another traveller suggests that a travel of 100 meters brings neither a petrol station nor a clump of trees into view, but a swamp and a bullock cart. Therefore, one cannot turn left there at all. To which, a fourth traveller counters by saying that even travelling 10 meters brings one into an ocean, so how could one travel 100 meters? Besides what is a \u0026lsquo;petrol station\u0026rsquo;, and who needs it anyway? There are only wooden rafts here …\nSuch a tract is virtual gibberish and is anything except \u0026lsquo;coherent\u0026rsquo;. No one has any idea whether it is a route description, where this \u0026lsquo;route\u0026rsquo; is, whether they are all about the same route or different routes, or what the \u0026lsquo;reference points\u0026rsquo; refer to. Just because these descriptions appear to be about \u0026lsquo;routes\u0026rsquo;, by virtue of this alone, they do not become sensible route descriptions or rival descriptions of the same route. It is true that both Buddha and Shankara speak about human beings. From this it does not follow that some \u0026lsquo;doctrine\u0026rsquo; is \u0026lsquo;Buddhist\u0026rsquo; and the other belongs to its \u0026lsquo;rival\u0026rsquo;, viz., the \u0026lsquo;Advaitic\u0026rsquo; philosophy of Shankara. Buddha is said to have formulated the doctrine of \u0026lsquo;anatman\u0026rsquo;, whereas it is indubitable that Shankara speaks of \u0026lsquo;atman\u0026rsquo;. However, this does not help us figure out what \u0026lsquo;atman\u0026rsquo; is;13 and even less what \u0026lsquo;anatman\u0026rsquo; is (except that it is supposed to be a negation of \u0026lsquo;atman\u0026rsquo;). And yet, the current Indian philosophy is the site of such \u0026lsquo;coherent\u0026rsquo; tracts, whether their authors are Indian or western. Why has this situation come about?\nIt has to do with what happened to the (reflections about) Indian traditions when they encountered the route descriptions that religions are. Instead of being stimulated by encountering such \u0026lsquo;alien\u0026rsquo; forms, Indian intellectuals appear simply to have succumbed.14 Was it merely the fact that these encounters with militant religions occurred within the framework of aggressive military conquests (first the Islamic Persia, later the Christian West)? Were there internal reasons (internal, that is, to the traditions and culture of India) for this state of affairs as well? How could the Indian intellectuals so thoughtlessly take over descriptions that could not have made any sense to them? Could it be because these traditions themselves ceased to make sense to the Indian intellectuals? How and when did reflections about these traditions divorce themselves from the inner life of these traditions? Does it make sense to say that living traditions go \u0026lsquo;subterranean\u0026rsquo;, become implicit as it were, and still remain living traditions? These are only a few of the questions we need to answer today.\nV\nThis paper has attempted to tackle one of the questions the organizers of this conference raise: what and who have been neglected and distorted by scholars\u0026rsquo; ideas of religion? My answer is that there is a fundamental neglect of the differences that differentiate entities like Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, etc. from religions like Christianity. Descriptions of the former have been assimilated into the frameworks evolved to describe the latter. Consequently, there is indeed a distortion but that has little to do with who has spoken for the Indian traditions. The distortion and the neglect have to do with a denial of the different kinds of diversities that exist between religions in different cultures and not with who has denied this. In fact, I propose that we replace the question, \u0026lsquo;who speaks for religion in the Academy?\u0026rsquo; with a more meaningful one: how to speak for religion in the Academy?\nThe agenda for the future of religious studies, if this domain is to have a meaningful future at all, will consist of attempts to develop novel ways of understanding religious and cultural diversity. Hitherto, people have hardly reflected on what kinds of diversity exist or on appropriate ways of describing them. In other words, not only do we need to provide different descriptions but also search for adequate ways of doing the same.\nThis search will not follow familiar roads and well-worn tracks. We need to find new paths because, while treading the old, we have become much like the medieval Naturalists. They catalogued and classified, but did not discover; described but failed to understand. We have catalogued religious (and cultural) diversity, described differences in detail, but have failed to understand what we describe. Common to both efforts is the assumption that diversity can be understood by providing a detailed description of the differences between phenomena. In our context, diversity does not merely mean that there are different religions and cultures, but that they are different in different ways. A failure to realize this will doom us to garnering details till \u0026lsquo;kingdom come\u0026rsquo;.\nToday, we need to think of the \u0026lsquo;otherness\u0026rsquo; in entirely different terms. One could even take an extreme position and argue that we communicate not because of a shared humanity but because we are different and thus speak differently. Without diversity, and the ensuing difference and disagreement, what is there to say except, as Wittgenstein put it, \u0026ldquo;wovon man nicht sprechen kann, darüber muss man schweigen\u0026rdquo; (whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent).\nNotes\nNicomachean Ethics, Book I. P. 1730; my italics. What do the phrases in the scare quotes mean? It will be made clear in the text later on. In front of me lies a book, The Art of Happiness, a dialogue with Dalai Lama. That is because, unlike Christianity, there are no \u0026lsquo;priests\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;monks\u0026rsquo; as convenient starting points. Not only that. I would like to identify one of the sources for the multiplicity of Indian traditions. Knowledge is not Eudaimonia but the middle-aged person has an \u0026lsquo;insight\u0026rsquo; into what it is. See further. A literal translation from Sanskrit is \u0026rsquo;the dawning of knowledge\u0026rsquo;. Now we can understand why \u0026lsquo;happiness\u0026rsquo; is a loose translation of \u0026lsquo;Eudaimonia\u0026rsquo;, and in what sense it has to do with knowledge. Here is where Aristotle meets another pagan culture. Often, spiritual experience is confused with the religious experience as such. This formulation is a variant of the famous thesis about the \u0026lsquo;dependent co-origination of the acts and the agent\u0026rsquo;. For example, the Anatta doctrine of the Buddhists is fundamentally different from the atman doctrine of \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo;. Many suggest that this accounts for their difference as religions the way the doctrine about the Messiah distinguishes Christianity from either Islam or Judaism. In other words, a study of the Indian traditions will also lead to the same point that the study of religion led me to in my 1994. Assuming, of course, that one recognises a \u0026lsquo;desert\u0026rsquo; or a \u0026lsquo;mirage\u0026rsquo; solely on the basis of descriptions alone. Since it is supposed to be \u0026lsquo;self-luminescent\u0026rsquo;, why bother figuring it out? This is the observation of the result, not a description of the process.

But what is the role of intellectuals in avoiding similar tragedies in the future?\nWhy can’t religion be political?\nObviously, the duty of the intellectual is to try and help us understand the nature of the events and the violence involved. In India and abroad, the concepts of ‘communalism’ and ‘communal violence’ are often used to analyse these riots. These tell us that the main cause behind the Hindu-Muslim conflicts in India is the use of religion for political ends. It is often added that religion itself is not responsible for the riots, but rather its misuse by power-hungry clerics and politicians. The harm of communalism lies in its mixing of political aims and religious identities, which is taken to cause violence. Let us have a closer look at this concept of communal violence.\nA first problem is that no theoretical framework is available which allows one to distinguish religion from other human phenomena. This point should not be confused with a demand for clear definitions. One may define the word ‘water’ in any way one chooses; such linguistic reform will not affect our understanding of the world much. The structure of the fluid water remains H2O and chemists are able to distinguish and separate it from other substances because of its composition. On the contrary, no one is able to show what differentiates the religious (as a phenomenon or domain of life) from the political. If that is the case, there is no way to understand the statements about the mixing of politics and religion. Since no tools are available to distinguish secular from religious interests or political from religious aims, the ‘communalism’ analysis becomes trivial: different communities come into conflict in the struggle for political power, because they believe they have divergent interests.\nDoes political religion spark communal violence?\nA second problem is that the supposed causal link between the use of religion to attain political goals and the occurrence of inter-community violence is absolutely unclear. Imagine a Buddhist leader invoking the ‘religious’ sentiments of her community in this way: she tells them Buddhist selflessness should defeat the egocentric materialism of other communities, so that society will not degenerate into cut-throat capitalism. It could be argued this is to make use of religion to obtain political power over society. One could equally propose the leader in question is spreading an ideology which makes her community believe that its secular interests are opposed to those of other religious communities. But it is both unclear why this should lead to violence between communities and what is immoral about the acts of this leader. If the example is too unreal, one can give similar descriptions of Gandhi’s satyagraha or Ashoka’s rule. These situations fit perfectly in the conception of communalism of the Indian intellectuals. Yet one can only wonder as to why they should generate inter-community riots. Such examples could be multiplied without end. They show it is not in the least clear what is immoral about the use of religion for political ends and how this ‘communalism’ is linked to violent events like the Gujarat riots.\nGiven these problems in making sense of the concept of communal violence, how to account for the widespread belief that the mixing of politics and religion is wrong and generates violence? After all, many of the analysts who invoke ‘communalism’ as an explanation are not cretins. We should explain how they have come to this belief and why they continue to hold it, in spite of its lack of clarity.\nThe Christian cliché and corrupt religion\nI would like to submit the following hypothesis for discussion: the claim that the use of religion for political ends is evil and provokes violence is an old cliché from Christianity. Within its theological framework, it makes perfect sense to accuse human beings of corrupting religion by abusing it for the satisfaction of their worldly desires. This corrupted religion then gives rise to conflicts, riots and violence. Such a story was embedded in the European common sense by the sixteenth century. It became especially popular in post-Reformation Britain to make sense of the Wars of Religion. The belief was that there was a pure primitive Christianity untainted by human hands, which is revealed by the biblical God as the one true religion. Reflecting this God’s will for humanity, the true religion can bring only peace, harmony and happiness. However, human beings - sinful as they are and misguided by the devil - corrupt this pure religion and try to use it for their own worldly and political ends. Needless to say, evil priests and crooked politicians are the prime suspects.\nSince the British believed that the traditions they encountered in India were instances of false religion, it was obvious to them they would find the same kind of demonic violence here. Hence, they saw all kinds of conflicts in India as the violence that inevitably results from the corruption of religion for worldly ends. In their eyes, traditional leaders became priests of the devil. Stereotypes emerged about cunning Brahmins and deceitful mullahs. Whenever violent riots occurred, the reason was obvious: such priests and politicians had deceived innocent believers into slaughtering each other in the name of religion.\nIn the process of colonial education, Indian intellectuals adopted this theological story from their colonial masters as an account about the ‘communal violence’ inherent in Indian society. Tragically, this Christian experience of India was mistaken for a valid description of its society. The tragedy continues today. The colonial consciousness of Indian intellectuals prevents them from seeing that they reproduce a silly theological story about the corrupting influence of humanity on religion as though it were scientific truth. If we really want to understand the Gujarat riots and similar horrific events, we first need to get rid of such common-sense clichés from the West.\nComments windwheel — 2013-07-20 11:46:00\nDoes any emic Indian genuinely believe that- \u0026rsquo; the use of religion for political ends is evil and provokes violence is an old cliché from Christianity?'\nI\u0026rsquo;m a Tamil Hindu- our literature shows religion being instrumentalized for violent political ends long before Christianity was known to us.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve translated some sermons by Gujerati and Hindi speaking Jain shravaks- they show that Ashoka himself indulged in this and quote traditional sources re. political instrumentalization of internecine sectarian violence.\nIn Urdu and Persian, the case is more dramatic yet with Shia-Sunni violence being linked to the rise and fall of the Sayyad bros. and inter Sunni Madhvi \u0026amp; Muhammadiya violence being linked to the vagaries of dynastic politics. What you describe and attribute to Christendom seems more explicit in Vernacular Indian tradition- the hypocritical mullah or pundit, the cruel tyrant seeking to kill off his brother by accusing him of being heterodox- this story is as old as the hills and deeply embedded in our culture. It is less of a feature in the West because they had primogeniture and monogamy so no Aurangazeb could usurp the throne from a Dara Shikoh on a religious pretext.\nIt may be that some English speaking intellectuals have, in recent years, started to espouse a Eurocentric theory but my guess is that they are only doing so as part of a Preference falsification based Credentialist Availability Cascade which cashes out as \u0026lsquo;all is fault of British divide \u0026amp; rule \u0026rsquo; or else (Modi quoting Savarkar\u0026rsquo;s study of the Mutiny) \u0026lsquo;Hindus \u0026amp; Muslims were united till Indian National Congress came along and divided them.\u0026rsquo;\nIf it is really true that \u0026lsquo;In the process of colonial education, Indian intellectuals adopted this theological story from their colonial masters as an account about the ‘communal violence’ inherent in Indian society\u0026rsquo; then the question arises as to why these indian \u0026lsquo;intellectuals\u0026rsquo; didn\u0026rsquo;t simply convert to Christianity? What perversity or congenital defect in the Indian psyche caused them to adopt one theological story of no great utility or obvious truth value while continuing to reject other theological stories promising far greater theological rewards?\n","tags":[],"title":"How do we understand the concept of Communal Violence?","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/how-do-we-understand-the-concept-of-communal-violence/"},{"categories":["adhoc","Balagangadhara","basics","evolution","religion"],"content":"You ask whether \u0026lsquo;in principle\u0026rsquo; a neurobiological theory on religion could \u0026ldquo;account\u0026rdquo; for the experience of the believers. The answer depends on what kind of an account you are asking for and what you have in mind when you say \u0026lsquo;in principle\u0026rsquo;. If you mean by \u0026lsquo;account\u0026rsquo;, whether it could predict or even explain, I do not think so. We know that, at the least, we are made up of atoms. Your question, in terms of the kind of challenge it poses (even though the degree of complexity changes), is identical to the question: could a theory in physics, in principle, ever account for our experiences? What does \u0026lsquo;in principle\u0026rsquo; mean here actually? There was a period when one thought, among other things, that it was possible \u0026lsquo;in principle\u0026rsquo; to describe mathematics in a purely logical language. That is, many thought that mathematics has a \u0026ldquo;logical structure\u0026rdquo; and that, therefore, one could reconstruct mathematics aided by a suitably powerful logic. (It is called the \u0026lsquo;Hilbert program\u0026rsquo;, named after the originator of this research program.) Then a mathematician called Kurt Gödel proved that, in principle, we cannot even prove the truth of elementary arithmetic on logical grounds: even though we can generate true statements in elementary arithmetic (and know that they are true; they are called \u0026ldquo;Gödel numbers\u0026rdquo;), we cannot prove their truth. Nor can we prove their falsity. They belong to the class of \u0026ldquo;undecidable\u0026rdquo; statements. In other words, what appears obvious to many of us today, namely, arithmetic is \u0026rsquo;logical\u0026rsquo; in nature cannot ever be \u0026ldquo;proved\u0026rdquo;. This is an impossibility theorem that Gödel proved in the 1930\u0026rsquo;s. So, what we think is possible in principle turns out to be impossible \u0026lsquo;in principle\u0026rsquo;.\nThe lessons? Many, but here is one: as our knowledge grows, so does our understanding what \u0026lsquo;in principle\u0026rsquo; means. Today, we would not know the things that a neurobiological theory has to do; we know even less about what a neurobiological theory of religion has to do. We do not know what it means to account for \u0026rsquo;experience\u0026rsquo;; we know even less what \u0026lsquo;religious experience\u0026rsquo; is and what requires accounting. However, we know enough to say the following: for any time in the foreseeable future, there will be no neurobiological theory that can account for (explain, or whatever else) \u0026ldquo;beliefs\u0026rdquo; of any kind. For the next hundred years at least, there will no neurobiological theory of \u0026lsquo;beliefs in superstrings\u0026rsquo; any more than there will be a neurobiological theory that explains the belief that \u0026ldquo;Bible is the true word of God\u0026rdquo;.\nIf you are interested in this debate, I suggest you try to read up on the \u0026lsquo;reductionism\u0026rsquo; debate in the philosophy of science and philosophy of psychology/philosophy of mind.

Stressing the need for an alternative understanding of the Western culture, Balagangadhara argues that Hinduism, caste system, and secularism are not colonial constructs but entities within the Western cultural experience. He believes that the so-called facts about India and her traditions are a result of colonial consciousness. To answer the questions about Indian traditions, we need to understand the Western culture.\nThis book will be of considerable interest to all those interested in understanding Indian society, culture, and traditions.

Forgive me for some Dawkins- bashing:\nIn a memorable passage, Dawkins discusses the problem of Trinitarianism in Christianity and extends it to other forms of \u0026ldquo;polytheism,\u0026rdquo; such as the cult of the Virgin Mary and the saints in Roman-Catholicism. \u0026ldquo;What impresses me about Catholic mythology,\u0026rdquo; he shares with the reader, \u0026ldquo;is partly its tasteless kitsch but mostly the airy nonchalance with which these people make up the details as they go along. It is just shamelessly invented\u0026rdquo; (Dawkins 2006: 35). As a reader, try to bracket away all presuppositions about religion and reread the sentences. If you succeed in doing so, the impact of Dawkins\u0026rsquo; claim dissolves. So what, if certain details of Roman-Catholicism are human inventions? What is the problem in aspects of religion being \u0026ldquo;shamelessly invented\u0026rdquo;? From a non-Christian, neutral point of view, it is unclear why Dawkins bothers to mention this. However, anyone with a basic understanding of the history of Christianity will note where his claim comes from: Dawkins himself reproduces a piece of theology in this sentence (apparently without knowing it). From its earliest beginnings, Christianity claimed that it was the original and pure revelation of God, first given to Adam. This original revelation had been corrupted by sinful idolaters, seduced by the Devil into the worship of the false god and his minions. This corruption, according to Christian theology, took the form of human additions to the pure divine revelation: rites and myths, fabricated by priests and prelates. During the Protestant Reformation, Luther, Calvin and their followers began to accuse the Roman-Catholic Church of the same sin of idolatry. They cried that the pope and his priests had invented a plethora of dogmas and rituals and imposed these on the believer as though they were part of God\u0026rsquo;s revelation and necessary to salvation. In this sense, the worst accusation one could make against Roman- Catholicism was that it consisted of \u0026ldquo;shameless human inventions.\u0026rdquo; The Enlightenment philosophes extended such charges of idolatry to all of Christianity and to all \u0026ldquo;religions\u0026rdquo; of humanity. All of these, including the notion of God itself, were human fabrications, the atheists among them claimed. Ironically, Enlightenment atheism thus presupposed and built on the claims of Christian theology. Without the background belief that there is something intrinsically wrong in religion being a human invention—very much a Christian belief—the impact of such charges simply disappears into thin air.\nAt this first level, Dawkins reproduces Christian theology, even though he masks it as an atheistic insight that is supposed to liberate humanity from religion.\nDiscussing the theological difficulties that polytheism allegedly creates, Dawkins continues: \u0026ldquo;How did the Greeks, the Romans and the Vikings cope with such polytheological conundrums? Was Venus just another name for Aphrodite, or were they two distinct goddesses of love? Was Thor with his hammer a manifestation of Wotan, or a separate god? Who cares? Life is too short to bother with the distinction between one figment of the imagination and many. Having gestured towards polytheism to cover myself against a charge of neglect, I shall say no more about it. For brevity I shall refer to all deities, whether poly- or monotheistic, as simply `God\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; (Dawkins 2006: 35-6). The first issue to point out is that Greek and Roman followers of the \u0026ldquo;pagan\u0026rdquo; traditions were not in the least bothered by such \u0026ldquo;theological conundrums.\u0026rdquo; This was the case, because to them the stories about Aphrodite, Venus, Zeus and Jupiter were just that: traditional stories, instead of theological doctrines (Balagangadhara 1994; Feeney 1998). To the Greeks and Romans, the stories were not subjects to truth claims; that is, the predicates \u0026ldquo;true\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;false\u0026rdquo; were simply not applicable to the many stories about the deities. Hence, many such apparently \u0026ldquo;contradictory\u0026rdquo; stories could co-exist without conflict. It was only when the church fathers tried to show that the Greeks and Romans had \u0026ldquo;false religion\u0026rdquo; that suddenly these stories became bearers of truth value and that the so- called \u0026ldquo;contradictions\u0026rdquo; appeared. Like the Christian ancestors who shaped their thought, the Enlightenment philosophers failed to grasp that the Roman and Greek stories were not meant to be doctrines or descriptions of the world. Hence, they ridiculed these stories as \u0026ldquo;mythologies,\u0026rdquo; fictionalized and embellished accounts of human history (Hazard 1935). The difficulties that Dawkins notices are those created by Christians and Enlightenment philosophers, who tried to make sense of the traditional stories of Greece and Rome as mythological doctrines.\nA second problematic issue lies in the use of the notion of polytheism. The contrast set to poly-theism, of course, is mono- theism (and, in a secondary sense, a-theism). The \u0026ldquo;theism\u0026rdquo; in these terms refers to \u0026ldquo;theos\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;god.\u0026rdquo; First, take monotheism, that is, Christianity, Judaism and Islam. Here the \u0026ldquo;theos\u0026rdquo; in the theism refers to the biblical God: the creator of heaven and earth. As a being and entity, this biblical God has certain properties. First, He is a being that exists outside the universe, outside space and time. Second, He is the sovereign creator and governor of the universe. Third, He is a \u0026ldquo;person\u0026rdquo; in the philosophical sense; he has a personal identity expressed in his plans and intentions. Fourth, His plans or intentions correspond perfectly to whatever happens in the universe. That is, He is omnipotent in the sense that there is no discrepancy between His intentions and His actions (as is the case among human beings): His will is law. As theologians have long told, (from our limited human perspective and understanding,) these are the essential properties of God (Swinburne 1977). Note now that if this is God or \u0026ldquo;theos,\u0026rdquo; there can be only one such being. If there were more than one, God could not be the sovereign creator and governor of the universe, whose will is law. Instead, there would be a clash of several such beings, each trying to be the sovereign. In this sense, if \u0026ldquo;God\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;theos\u0026rdquo; refers to the biblical God, there cannot be several Gods. Consequently, if the \u0026ldquo;theos\u0026rdquo; in poly-theism has the same reference as the \u0026ldquo;theos\u0026rdquo; in mono-theism, then \u0026ldquo;polytheism\u0026rdquo; is a nonsensical notion. It cannot exist.\nYet, and this is the third issue, it appears from the above passage that Dawkins means to say that all \u0026ldquo;deities\u0026rdquo; are the same and can all be designated with the name \u0026ldquo;God,\u0026rdquo; no matter whether it concerns \u0026ldquo;monotheism\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;polytheism.\u0026rdquo; Not only does he use the latter notion as though it makes eminent sense, he also argues (albeit for the sake of brevity) that the \u0026ldquo;theos\u0026rdquo; in both kinds of theism is \u0026ldquo;God.\u0026rdquo; At the same time, a brief analysis shows that it is conceptually impossible that \u0026ldquo;monotheism\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;polytheism\u0026rdquo; refer to the same \u0026ldquo;God.\u0026rdquo; How to make sense of this? It may appeal to brevity or any other reasons, Dawkins\u0026rsquo; above paragraph remains conceptual nonsense. However, respecting the principle of charity, as interpreters we have to try and make sense of this paragraph as the product of a reasonably intelligent mind. The challenge, then, is the following: we need to show how the conceptual background that sustains Dawkins\u0026rsquo; reasoning about religion makes paragraphs like the above seem reasonably coherent, in spite of the absence of coherency.\n","tags":[],"title":"Dawkin’s  Delusion or The God Delusion?","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/dawkins-delusion-or-the-god-delusion/"},{"categories":["adhoc","evolution","Jakob","secularization"],"content":" People like Scott Atran and Sloan Wilson abuse evolutionary biology to produce ad hoc explanations of an explanandum whose truth they presuppose: the universality of religion. Their explanations are no better than those discussed by Balu in chapter 5 of \u0026lsquo;The Heathen in his blindness: Asia, the West and the dynamic of religion.\u0026rsquo;. Paraphrasing Balu, we may say that they consist of \u0026rsquo;two quarters of theology, a quarter of evolutionary biology and a quarter of illiterate ethnology\u0026rsquo;.\nThis universality of religion is a pre-theoretical assumption, as is the case in the earlier explanations by Hume, Freud and others. Whatever definition one chooses to give of \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo; (\u0026lsquo;implausible beliefs\u0026rsquo;, etc.), it remains the case that these guys commit the fallacy of petitio principii: they presuppose the truth of a proposition whose truth they should prove, namely, that religion is universal. After all, it cannot depend on one\u0026rsquo;s definition of the word \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo; whether or not religion is universal. Just imagine we let the existence of gravitation on all planets depend on our definition of \u0026lsquo;gravitation\u0026rsquo; (\u0026lsquo;a force that exists on all planets\u0026rsquo;).\nIn fact, they commit another petitio principii also: they presuppose that religion is a human product, the product of human evolution (whether as a by-product or \u0026lsquo;spandrel\u0026rsquo; or as an adaptation). Since religion claims that it is God\u0026rsquo;s gift to humanity and not of human origin, one should have proof before one supposes that it is a human product. It is impossible to prove that religion is of human and not of divine origin. Therefore, Atran and Sloan Wilson are engaged in a double petitio principii.\nOn top, these guys are ignorant of the object they claim to study. Firstly, they do not know what makes some phenomenon into religion. Hence, they really don\u0026rsquo;t know what it is they are explaining. Secondly, their knowledge of religions like Christianity and traditions like the Hindu traditions is superficial at best and non-existent at worst.\nSo, I would suggest not to take these guys too seriously. If newspapers spend pages on discussing these evolutionary explanations of religion, this is the case only because most journalists are not researchers. Scott Atran, Sloan Wilson and Dennett make fools of themselves by producing such silly explanations of religion.\n","tags":[],"title":"Secularized Christian theology and evolutionary explanations of religion","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/secularized-christian-theology-and-evolutionary-explanations-of-religion/"},{"categories":["adhoc","evolution","Jakob","secularization"],"content":" It is very disappointing to see how these evolutionary theorists of religion lack knowledge of religions other than garden variety Judeo-Christianity (where they seem to have at least some factual knowledge, as in Scott Atran\u0026rsquo;s case, they reproduce standard textbook stories about Hinduism that have been left behind a few decades back).\nIf they did a serious study, it would perhaps strike them that no one has ever given either theoretical or empirical proof for the claim that religion is a human universal. From the 13th century onwards, European travelers, missionaries, merchants and scholars simply assumed that there would be religion in all societies. With this assumption in the background, they looked for the \u0026lsquo;beliefs\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;gods\u0026rsquo; of these societies. In the process, these western minds invented religions everywhere. Later scholars began to create all kinds of definitions of \u0026ldquo;religion\u0026rdquo; in order to accommodate their (cultural) intuition that religion is universal. As though a definition of a word can help us decide on the universality of a phenomenon. After all, we don\u0026rsquo;t use a definition of the word \u0026ldquo;gravitation\u0026rdquo; in order to find out whether gravitation exists on all planets, do we?\nThe same goes for the so-called theories or explanations of religion. These simply presuppose as a pre-theoretical given that religion exists in all cultures and societies. Then they concoct ad hoc accounts groomed to explain for this pre-theoretical assumption. In the process, they abuse evolutionary biology, cognitive neurosciences, psychology, etc. to produce unscientific just-so stories. What they seem to miss, is that this is a massive exercise in the fallacy of petitio principii. That is, one assumes the truth of a proposition whose truth should be demonstrated: that religion is a cultural universal.\nIf this course intends to be scientific and serious in any way, it will have to answer a few questions: What is the proof for the universality of religion? How could one test this claim about the universality of religion? That is, which criteria allow one to test the presence of religion in a culture or society? This cannot be solved by giving definitions as to \u0026ldquo;the universal belief in spiritual or superhuman beings.\u0026rdquo; Notions like belief, spiritual, superhuman are too vague to provide us with any real test. One cannot also draw on evolutionary biology and claim that it shows that religion is universal, since evolutionary biology does not give us the structural properties that allow us to recognize the object of religion (and this would simply be a repetition of the petitio principii).\nIf one begins to realize the difficulty of proving that religion is a human universal, then the question becomes: How come all these brilliant minds have simply presupposed that religion is universal? Historically, it is very clear that we have inherited this assumption from Christianity. Christian theology tells us that God has given religion to humanity. It is inscribed in our souls, so to say. Thus, the stubborn presupposition that religion is universal (whether among scholars of religion, biologists, psychologists, common sense, \u0026hellip;) is simply a secularized Christian theological claim.\nPerhaps all these evolutionary thinkers are then abusing Darwin\u0026rsquo;s beautiful and brilliant theory in order to reproduce an old theological story about humanity. Surprising no, given the supposed atheism of people like Dan Dennett?\nAnyway, those interested can have a look at S.N. Balagangadhara, \u0026ldquo;The Heathen in His Blindness\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;: Asia, the West and the Dynamic of Religion (Leiden, 1994; Manohar, 2005).\nComments windwheel — 2013-07-20 12:03:00\nAn evolutionary theory of Religion, if it is Eurocentric, can\u0026rsquo;t possibly claim that Religion exists everywhere. What it can and does claim is that under the same selection pressure evolutionarily stable outcomes will show convergence of a type which may justify Universalist ecumenism AT A CERTAIN STAGE OF CIVILIZATIONAL COMPLEXITY. However the \u0026lsquo;future of this Illusion\u0026rsquo; depends on something unknown- viz. the future fitness landscape.\nYou may recall that Darwin\u0026rsquo;s theories enabled the Buddhists to beat the Xtians at the Panadura debate.

That is because, according to these readings, Buddha claims that \u0026ldquo;the meaning and purpose of life is to cease existing\u0026rdquo; (nirvana) or because he says that \u0026ldquo;suffering\u0026rdquo; constitutes the \u0026ldquo;meaning of life\u0026rdquo;. These are our Buddhologists to whom we are supposed to go in order to understand Buddhism!\nYour problem illustrates most beautifully how we, Indian heathens, understand the religious language of Christianity. We understand them from within the perspectives of our own experiences of the world. To us, let us say, attaining \u0026lsquo;Moksha\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;Nirvana\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;Atmagyaana\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;Brahmagyaana\u0026rsquo; (or whatever else) is a human goal. Some achieve it, many do not, but we are indeed taught to take some such thing as a goal in life. Achieving this goal is also \u0026rsquo;the meaning\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;purpose\u0026rsquo; of our individual lives. (For instance, consider the words you use as synonyms in this fragmentary sentence: \u0026ldquo;the purpose of human existence according to my understanding and interpretation of Indic traditions is to aspire and reach the supreme one\u0026rdquo;. To aspire, to reach and to achieve some goal is (identical) to the purpose of our individual lives. That is, you use \u0026rsquo;to aspire\u0026rsquo;, \u0026rsquo;to reach\u0026rsquo; \u0026rsquo;to achieve\u0026rsquo; as explications of the meaning of \u0026lsquo;purpose\u0026rsquo;.)\nSuppose I raise the following point: surely striving for Artha (riches), Kama (love) and Dharma are also \u0026lsquo;purposes\u0026rsquo; (i.e. goals) in human life. In all probability, you will say something like this: \u0026ldquo;yes, but the supreme purpose is to achieve \u0026hellip;.\u0026rsquo;\nReligion, as an EI account, talks about the meaning and purpose of existence (for what purpose has mankind come into being?), of the world (why is there something rather than nothing?) and such like. Our questions and the questions raised within the framework of religion are not even remotely similar.\nII If we want to speak about the meaning of human existence, at least one condition has to be met: such an existence (from birth to death at least) must embody a plan or a reason. Such a plan or reason cannot be that of the individual in question for the simple reason that his/her birth (at the least, not to speak of the first years of his/her existence) does not instantiate any of his/her plans. Only in such cases could we say that the human existence has meaning. In the Indian traditions, I have not found any group of people or texts speaking in such terms. Even those who speak of a creator, speak of creation as a \u0026rsquo;lila\u0026rsquo; not as expressions of the plans or reasons of the creator. In the Semitic religions by contrast, the entire Universe exhibits the plan and order that God intends and wills.\nComments Skanda — 2014-08-05 12:42:00\nFourfold are goals, but experience is the purpose of existence. And experience is 3-fold (bhoga, swarga, apavarga). Bhoga is again 3-fold (sukha, dukha, moha) because phenomenal existence is based on 3 primal qualities. But the substratum of ALL experience is singular: Ananda or happiness.

Let me react to their letters on this forum, and I shall leave it there for the time being.\nNeither Michael Witzel nor Steve Farmer answers my request for clarifications but simply take off on polemical tones. I do not see what purpose is thereby served. Globally speaking, both their letters seem to indicate that they are convinced that either I am aligned with the Hindutva movement or that I am a Hindutva man myself or both. Of course, because we have not met each other so far, there is only one way for them to divine my political preferences: through my writings. Witzel claims that he has read them, whereas Farmer keeps silent about the issue. It is a matter of public record that I claim that \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; (as a \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo;) does not exist in India. Consequently, from my writings on the subject, no one can accuse me of supporting a stance that wants to found India on \u0026lsquo;hinduness\u0026rsquo; or on \u0026lsquo;hindudom\u0026rsquo; or on \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; (whether conceived as a \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo; or called as \u0026lsquo;sanatana dharma\u0026rsquo;). So, from where could anyone draw conclusion that these two have drawn? Consider the following possibility: let us assume that in some of my writings, I reach the same conclusion as some or another ideologue from Hindutva. (Of course, neither Farmer nor Witzel shows that this is the case. But that is not the issue.) In other words, let us assume that, with respect to some or another issue, I arrive at the same conclusion as people from the Hinudtva movement do. The question is: what does that indicate, or prove or is an evidence for? After all, Witzel, Farmer and others reach the same conclusion as the Hindutva people do, when you ask them about the sum of two integers (say adding two to itself); or (assuming the presence of relevant There is only one answer possible in this case: there exists a unique theory (\u0026rsquo;the Hindutva theory\u0026rsquo;) from which one can derive certain conclusions. It is not possible to derive the same conclusion from any other theory that we know (or can invent). Consequently, one can argue backwards: if someone, anyone, supports a specific conclusion (\u0026rsquo;the Hindutva conclusion\u0026rsquo;) then that is because such a conclusion is derivable only from the \u0026lsquo;Hindutva theory\u0026rsquo;. Only a fool could entertain making such a claim today, if ever. Assuming that Witzel and Farmer are not fools, they appear reasonably intelligent to me, how then could they \u0026lsquo;see\u0026rsquo; Hindutva in my writings? A more charitable assumption would be: Witzel either has not read my writings (he lies when he says he has) or has not understood them at all (which makes him dim witted). Choose your poison.\nThe conclusion is simple with respect to their global tone: they just do not know what they are talking about. To me, ignorance of some subject is a reason to keep quiet about that subject; to them it is an occasion to be pretentious and abrasive. I suppose it takes all kinds of people to keep the world going\u0026hellip;\nLet me address myself to their specific mails. To begin with Witzel first. He suggests that reactions like his are to be expected when one enters \u0026lsquo;political waters\u0026rsquo; (and becomes ad hominem when he insinuates about my naiveté in thinking of myself as \u0026lsquo;a philosopher\u0026rsquo;), especially because Hindutva has damaged his soul. Of course, he apologises (for the use of the word \u0026lsquo;soul\u0026rsquo;?) quickly and provides (what appears) as a synonym: one of his many \u0026lsquo;atmans\u0026rsquo;. Grotesque: not only because (even as a joke) he speaks about plurality of \u0026lsquo;atmans\u0026rsquo; but also because he seems to make fun of those of us who object to such \u0026rsquo;translations\u0026rsquo;. (Of course, having a grotesque sense of humor is nothing to get excited about, and I do not want to make an issue about it either.) Well, those who know my biography know that this comment about my own involvement in \u0026lsquo;politics\u0026rsquo; is also grotesque. In other words, an advice by someone who does not know (or want to know) what he is talking about. Quite independent of all the above, a question bugs me: what have I to do with either his damaged soul or his multiple atmans? I am not his psychiatrist or his friend or even an acquaintance. How does it concern me, as an individual, what happens to the \u0026lsquo;soul\u0026rsquo; (or the multiple \u0026lsquo;atmans\u0026rsquo;) of one Michael Witzel? What is its relevance to understanding his comments about me? I can think of only one possible (charitable) answer: the Hinudtva attack has unhinged Witzel. So, he is not in control of himself and sees Hindutva plots everywhere. (Perhaps, this explains why he cannot even pen coherent posts.) May be. May be not.\nAbout the invitation. John Blair did invite him: but not for a \u0026lsquo;conference\u0026rsquo; but to a panel that Blair organized in the Asia Network conference in Texas early this year. I wrote him a mail inviting him to participate in the conference in Delhi. He declined my invitation by saying that he is \u0026rsquo;not interested\u0026rsquo;. In any case, he declined Blair\u0026rsquo;s invitation because, he says, he had \u0026ldquo;seen my and my cohorts\u0026rsquo; production before.\u0026rdquo; I have never met this man (Witzel) in any conference I have been to; none of my students have either. So, where could he have \u0026ldquo;seen\u0026rdquo; us or our \u0026lsquo;productions\u0026rsquo;? Clearly, the only charitable interpretation in this case is: this man is suffering from delusion. He \u0026lsquo;imagines\u0026rsquo; all kinds of encounters that have never taken place.\nOf course, when he speaks of my and my cohorts\u0026rsquo; production, he speaks about the so-called \u0026lsquo;Hindutva\u0026rsquo; fests. That is, he has simply assumed as true whatever his fancy dictates. How can one ever take such a man for a scholar?\nTo Farmer\u0026rsquo;s mail. He claims that he has taken a look at the abstracts accepted at the conference and finds them (most? all?) thoroughly bad. I have two remarks to make. The first is that the parallel paper session is the least important facet of the conference, when it comes to judging its scientific or intellectual merits. The intellectual centre of gravity lies in the \u0026lsquo;platform sessions\u0026rsquo; and the \u0026lsquo;round table discussions\u0026rsquo;. The second remark is this: most of these paper abstracts come from Indians working in India. One of the things about India is the absence of \u0026lsquo;religious studies\u0026rsquo; there. People are not used to working in this domain and, consequently, in the early days of promoting any such studies, you will invariably come across amateurishly conceived papers. Were the programming committee to use the criteria it otherwise normally uses, we would have had to disqualify all (or most) Indian contributions. One of the aims of the RRI cluster is to promote a serious study of religions in the Indian academic environment: hence the need to be generous, encouraging and tolerant. This selection is the best of the lot: the others were even worse. Farmer can only be \u0026lsquo;stunned\u0026rsquo; by the participation of academics in this conference, if he believes that it is not the task of academics to encourage (hitherto) non-existent studies in India. If we want to do that, we have to begin with where the Indian academics are: they are nowhere in the field of religious studies. It is at least a work of a decade (if not more) to encourage the Indian intellectuals to take up this domain seriously. Why make fun of those who cannot, as yet, do research at the same level of sophistication as the western intellectuals? Farmer might not want to help the Indian intellectuals learn new skills; why heap scorn on those who would like to? And then he shifts to Koenraad Elst. The discussion, if you remember, was about my (and my students\u0026rsquo;) research; the issue was whether or not our research should be \u0026lsquo;politically correct\u0026rsquo; or seek truth. Now, I am suddenly supposed to defend the research of Koenraad Elst as \u0026lsquo;scientific\u0026rsquo;. Let me make something very clear. I do know that Koenraad Elst is accused of being \u0026lsquo;pro-Hindutva\u0026rsquo;. However, to me, this is not a reason to boycott having discussions with him. If he submits an abstract of a paper, and the programming committee judges that the abstract passes the criteria in use, then he has the right to present his positions at the conference. I do not look at the skin color, the passport, the sexual leanings or political convictions of individuals in order to find them fit to participate in intellectual discussions. (Why, I even invited Witzel!) If they pass the criteria we use, then they get to have a forum to speak. Even if they are hard liners from the Hindutva or die-hard secularists. As long as one is willing to argue and defend a position on reasonable grounds, such an individual enters the intellectual citadel. This is and has always been my intellectual conviction. I shall not change it just because some nasty minds gossip about me or my students. We have given the platform to one such secularist: Achin Vinayak. What is wrong with either that or allowing Koenraad Elst to come and tell his story?\nFurther, he suggests that I confuse scientific research with politically inspired propaganda. That might or might not be the case. However, what has that to do with calling our research \u0026ldquo;politically motivated tripe\u0026rdquo;?\nIn short, it is sad to read what these two write. Probably, they ascribe to themselves the heroic role of preserving some \u0026rsquo;noble values\u0026rsquo; in India, which many Indians of today (all the \u0026lsquo;Hindus\u0026rsquo;? Or only \u0026rsquo;the Hinudtva\u0026rsquo;?) trample under their feet. They seem to aim at rescuing India from the Indians. Well, I cannot wish them luck in this endeavour: as an Indian, I am offended by the fact that it is both sanctimonious and pretentious. These two even lack the elementary human decency to carry on a reasonable discussion and are not averse to being rude and abrasive. My guilt, apparently, is one of association, even though it is unclear who I am not supposed to be associating with or what evidence there is for my association. Comments Danila Cinellu — 2015-07-16 14:16:28\nToo sorry to know that Western scholars boycott and offend Indian ones in such an arrogant way. Can I ask why Witzel labels you as \u0026lsquo;Hindutva\u0026rsquo;? Given that Koenraad Elst is mentioned here, I can just guess that your research led you to reject the \u0026ldquo;Aryan Invasion Hypothesis\u0026rdquo; (or whatever sub-species of it linguists have been proposing). As far as I know, Savarkar himself, as author of \u0026ldquo;Essentials of Hindutva\u0026rdquo;, was quite fond of it. So I seriously do not understand what help Witzel \u0026amp; co are supposed to give to free-minded no-nazist\n","tags":["Atman","Hindutva","Michael Witzel","Steve Farmer"],"title":"Intellectual prowess of Michael Witzel","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/intellectual-prowess-of-michael-witzel/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","basics","criticism"],"content":"Steve Farmer is not an expert on secularism only in the sense that he has followed it from the \u0026lsquo;outside\u0026rsquo; (meaning, probably, he has not written anything about the issue himself). Apparently, the reason why he has not contributed to the debate has to do with the fact that (a) no legitimate researcher can take the debate seriously; and (b) Farmer is one such. Witness how he describes it: \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve watched this so-called debate for nearly a decade now from the outside, and nothing whatsoever has changed. Nor have I ever met a single legitimate researcher who took it seriously.\u0026rdquo; I wish some of the Indian intellectuals who have participated in the debate would read this judgment and digest what Farmer thinks of them. They will be thrilled to know that they are \u0026lsquo;illegitimate\u0026rsquo; scholars!\nThe typical \u0026lsquo;academic\u0026rsquo; way of saying that one does not have criticisms of a work is by acting pompously: \u0026ldquo;I have read it but I am not impressed\u0026rdquo;. Many academics hate acknowledging that there is much they have not read or, if they have, that they have nothing to say on that. After all, your \u0026lsquo;intelligence\u0026rsquo; is proved by the fact that you can demolish everything except your own pet theory; so, they say \u0026lsquo;I am not impressed\u0026rsquo;. This remark works when one has a high-standing in the academic world; further, by making such a remark, one also suggests that one is so \u0026lsquo;busy\u0026rsquo; doing \u0026lsquo;serious scientific research\u0026rsquo; that one cannot be bothered to spend time criticizing third-rate ideas. In none of the domains I work is Steve Farmer (or his work) either known or recognized. He is a non-entity in the domains of sociology, political theory, psychology, philosophy and Ethics, law, history\u0026hellip; So, whether or not he is \u0026lsquo;impressed\u0026rsquo; by my writings leaves me and my academic colleagues cold. My peers in the peer-reviewed scientific journals find our writings on secularism worth publishing. If Farmer has anything interesting to say, apart from not being \u0026lsquo;impressed\u0026rsquo;, he can do so in the pages of all these journals. So far, he has not; and, I predict, nor will he ever.\nFarmer is playing such a game: showing that he is both a \u0026lsquo;serious researcher\u0026rsquo; and a very \u0026lsquo;intelligent\u0026rsquo; man by telling you that he is \u0026rsquo;not impressed\u0026rsquo;. Do not expect academic courtesy in such games: it is played only by those pretentious people who are unable to contribute anything to scientific research but fancy themselves as either \u0026lsquo;brilliant intellectuals\u0026rsquo; or even \u0026lsquo;geniuses\u0026rsquo;.\nMany Kannada intellectuals and UR Anathamurthy play the indigenous version of the same game. Some are also prejudiced; a few others ignorant. Many would not understand our arguments because they lack the required background knowledge. In short, most Kannada intellectuals (including UR) are at a disadvantage when it comes to discussing with us. They cannot show humility towards learning the way a student can; these people are already \u0026rsquo;established\u0026rsquo; and they make their living on the basis of the \u0026lsquo;authority\u0026rsquo; they have been conferred with. To acknowledge that one is ignorant (of many things) or that one is wrong (about one\u0026rsquo;s beliefs) requires that people who call themselves \u0026lsquo;intellectuals\u0026rsquo; are also truly that: ready to learn at any moment and acknowledge mistakes, when they discover them.\nLet me give you an example of one such true intellectual. Gottlob Frege is rightly considered as the father of modern formal logic. At the beginning of the twentieth century, he wrote a book called \u0026lsquo;The Foundations of Arithmetic\u0026rsquo; (in German), which was an attempt to describe arithmetic as formal, logical system. The manuscript version of the book apparently circulated in Europe and just when Frege received the page-proofs of the book, he also received a letter from a young unknown (at that moment) British student. This student showed that there was a fundamental flaw in Fregean system, which made Frege\u0026rsquo;s two decades work a wasted effort. Frege nevertheless published his book but with a foreword. There he spoke of the above letter, explained the criticism of this student (it is called the \u0026lsquo;barber paradox\u0026rsquo;) and openly acknowledged that his work (of the previous two decades) was a waste. He published it nonetheless, more for historical reasons than for its cognitive relevance. That young and unknown student answered to the name of Bertrand Russell who, at a later stage, reacted to an unknown male nurse from Vienna (during the First World War) the way Frege had reacted to him. That nurse was Ludwig Wittgenstein, another great thinker of the twentieth century.\nThese are the kind of people we should aspire to become if we have to bear the title of an \u0026lsquo;intellectual\u0026rsquo; proudly.\n","tags":["Michael Witzel","Steve Farmer","UR Ananthamurthy"],"title":"What makes one an intellectual?","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/what-makes-one-an-intellectual/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","colonial consciousness","enlightenment","experience","Indian traditions","knowledge"],"content":" As I have often said, the most intriguing aspect of the Indian culture is the kind of knowledge it produced and encouraged people to produce: experiential knowledge which emerges by systematically reflecting on our (human) experiences in the world. As human beings, our experiences are many: no one set, no one kind of experience exhausts what we go through. From the purely personal experiences of the world (our ambitions, hopes, dreams, frustrations, etc) to the entirely social ones (the experiences of sorrow and injustice that other human beings in the world experience). So, knowledge that reflects on or thinks about and systematizes such experiences presupposes multiple learning sites, many diverse perspectives and varied kinds of intellectual skills.\nIf Indian culture encouraged the production of such knowledge, it also produced (or gave birth) to people who were able to teach the relevant skills to people in order to enable them to go about knowledgeably in the world. Anyone and everyone who was willing to learn this was taught; anyone and everyone who was capable of learning it, produced such knowledge. What exactly was taught, when people were taught to think about their experiences? How were these abilities (call them skills for the sake of convenience) taught and retaught over generations, across the whole of India? These are important but ill-understood questions of today.\nTwo factors are of importance here, for now. One: reflection on experience was itself taught experientially\u0026rsquo; (a better word would be \u0026lsquo;practically\u0026rsquo;) because the results of such reflection, which transform experience, can only be experiential. Our traditions did not write the \u0026lsquo;how to\u0026rsquo; manuals as we know them today, even though most of what they wrote are practical manuals. Two: we cannot understand them properly today because of more than one thousand years of \u0026lsquo;colonial consciousness\u0026rsquo;. The contribution of the British colonialism was to provide us with a pair of spectacles with which we are born: all these manuals from our ancestors appear to us as \u0026lsquo;philosophies\u0026rsquo; and \u0026rsquo;theories\u0026rsquo; about the world. We cannot even imagine that a Shankara or a Buddha did not write tracts about the world; we do not see how a Brahmasutra Bhasyha or a Bhagavadgita or a Yogasutra could be anything but a \u0026rsquo;theory\u0026rsquo; about the world.\nAt the same time, we also inherit the modern day world. We are students of scientific theories and technological achievements. We are learning to do scientific research and build theories, in whatever form or fashion we do so. We are also learning the need to distinguish between scientific theories and non-scientific ones and we also know that sciences are one of the best examples of human knowledge.\nWe are now confronted with the following task: to re-establish our connection to the Indian traditions and its way of teaching to reflect on human experience. However, there is no direct way to do so. We have to go, out of sheer necessity, through the prism of scientific theorizing. This is not only necessary but also desirable: we now need to develop ways of thinking about experiences in a systematic fashion and science, in the first place, is systematic thinking and social science can only be a systematic reflection on human experience. This means, we have to bring together, in one and the same movement, two threads in human history which have developed completely independent of each other: the practical way of teaching and thinking about human experience and a theoretical way of reflecting about nature. Our road to the former is through the latter.\nIf and when we succeed, we will have brought these two things together: to think practically about human experience through building theories about human experience. To put it a bit absurdly: we will teach practically in a scientific way or build scientific theories in a practical way. (These sentences do not mean much today, but one day we will make sense of them.)\nThere is only one way to transform life into \u0026rsquo;the\u0026rsquo; site of learning and that will be practical, scientific way. We will have to solve practically what has been a basic theoretical question in philosophy: the relation between theory and practice.\n","tags":[],"title":"How to access Indian traditions?","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/how-to-access-indian-traditions/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","belief","enlightenment","sat(asat)","real"],"content":"With some justifiable distortion, one can claim that the Indian Adhyatmic traditions revolve partially around some \u0026lsquo;philosophical\u0026rsquo; questions: what is real and what is existence? Is there a distinction between the two and, if yes, how to draw that line? This is a distortion because the debate never took this form; it is justifiable nonetheless to present it this way because it gives us a handle to tackle them today. However, we need to note that this is our way of posing the question, not theirs. Therefore, whether or not \u0026ldquo;believing\u0026rdquo; in Rama or Krishna entails the existence of such entities requires clarity about notions like \u0026rsquo;existence\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;belief\u0026rsquo; in the Indian traditions. I do not have this clarity and, only recently, I was told that the Indian intellectual traditions (in Sanskrit) do not have a word for \u0026lsquo;belief\u0026rsquo;. (It is as yet unclear to me what this implies: does it have the same force as the statement that Indians did not have a word for \u0026lsquo;gravitation\u0026rsquo; either or whether the notion of knowledge that we have is different from what we think knowledge is today.) Consequently, I cannot say much about this discussion today.\nOnly recently, I have begun to come to grips with what meditation is (as I can endorse it within the framework of my knowledge about the 21st century world). This understanding of what \u0026lsquo;adhyatma\u0026rsquo; is has also helped me come to grips with the notions of \u0026lsquo;real\u0026rsquo; and \u0026rsquo;existence\u0026rsquo;, the way, I believe, Indian traditions have used them so far. One of these days (hopefully, soon) I intend to write a note on the issue of adhyatma. Until such stage, I am afraid you have to be content with this (rather cryptic) remark.\nYou ask: \u0026ldquo;What does it mean to be a bhakta of Rama or Krishna? Does it mean we should believe certain things about them? Or does it mean we display certain attitudes towards these characters and stories?\u0026rdquo; The answer is: choose whichever option helps you to become their bhakta, if that is what you want. To bhakti, both the questions and their answers are utterly immaterial. Ramayana is a way of achieving enlightenment and neither the success nor its efficacy depends on either the questions or their answers. Answering these questions will not help you become their bhakta; neither does ignorance about these prevent you from becoming one.\nIn the simplest possible terms, and to repeat once again: Ramayana is a way (to some, the only way) to reach enlightenment. When I write the note I intend, you will see that this is the basic truth about Ramayana. (When you understand this, as our traditions never tire of saying, you will have understood everything.)\n","tags":[],"title":"Real vs. Existence","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/real-vs-existence/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","History","intentionality","real"],"content":"One of the questions that has come up in this discussion is the following: are we logically forced to assume the \u0026rsquo;existence\u0026rsquo; of, say, Rama or Krishna, when we \u0026lsquo;believe\u0026rsquo; in them? This question has partly been responsible for the discussion about the \u0026lsquo;historicity\u0026rsquo; of Ramayana. Here is my answer as I see the situation today.\nIn some sense, we all work with some notions (however vague they might be) of \u0026lsquo;belief\u0026rsquo; and \u0026rsquo;existence\u0026rsquo;. These have at least two origins: (a) the western philosophical and scientific discourses about them, the way these have percolated into our common-sense; (b) their reinforcement by our day-to-day experiences in the world. That is to say, we have some conceptions of what human beings are (however vague or even incoherent these may be), what their properties are and so on. In other words, this notion of human beings tells us that (a) we are creatures who can form beliefs about some things (this \u0026lsquo;aboutness\u0026rsquo; is called intentionality in the relevant literatures); (b) that these beliefs could be about the world, about language, about ourselves, about what exists in the world and so on; (c) that some of these beliefs are about existent objects, whereas other beliefs are about non-existent objects; (d) and that to \u0026lsquo;believe in\u0026rsquo;, logically speaking, either entails or presupposes (it is irrelevant for now whether it is a presupposition or an entailment) that the entity we \u0026lsquo;believe in\u0026rsquo; is believed to exist. And so on. If we assume this picture of human beings to be true, then it follows that \u0026ldquo;believing in Rama or Krishna\u0026rdquo; has the same force as \u0026ldquo;believing in Christ or God\u0026rdquo;. Thus, one has to ascribe the logical truth about their existence to those who \u0026ldquo;believe in\u0026rdquo; these figures. In simple terms, if you \u0026ldquo;believe in\u0026rdquo; Rama or Krishna, then you are logically compelled to believe in their existence as well, just in case you endorse this picture about human beings.\nThe problem we face today is this: this is not the only conception of human beings that exists in the world. We know of at least one other culture, the Indian for instance, that postulates (almost) the opposite: it is a pernicious illusion (agyana) to think that human beings are intentional creatures. Therefore, the idea that they have (or form) beliefs about the world because they are such intentional creatures is itself an illusion. (What is not \u0026lsquo;real\u0026rsquo; is considered as illusory here. Illusions exist but they are not real because of their existence. That is, what exists may or may not be real. However, this issue is secondary.) Consequently, if what I am told is true, Sanskrit does not have a word for \u0026lsquo;belief\u0026rsquo;.\nThus, if you accept the first picture, Indians do have beliefs (like all other human creatures), and they do believe in the existence of Rama or Krishna if they believe in them. To say anything else is absolute nonsense. The absence of the word \u0026lsquo;belief\u0026rsquo; in Sanskrit is no more or no less significant than the absence of words for \u0026lsquo;gravitation\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;genes\u0026rsquo; in Sanskrit (or any other Indian language) before their formulation in their respective theories. This is one way or arguing.\nThe second way of arguing is to suggest that there is no obvious superiority to the first picture about human beings and that what we perceive (namely, that human beings have intentionality), by virtue of that perception alone, is not true. (We perceive the movement of Sun around the earth, but that does not guarantee its truth). If we take this route and develop a theory of human beings that is richer than the elaboration of the common-sense perception that parades as a theory (which is what the first picture is), quite obviously, even such facts as the absence of a word for \u0026lsquo;belief\u0026rsquo; begin to assume some significance. Then, we can say that the way the first picture formulates the problem is unintelligible and that this picture is incapable of framing questions about the Indian culture.\nI take the second route because I \u0026lsquo;believe\u0026rsquo; that the way Indian traditions have framed questions about human beings is far superior to the way the western common-sense does. That is, that Indian traditions have done better than Christian theology. I am aware that I need to elaborate on the so-called theory about the human beings in the Indian traditions to make this claim stick. Even though I have been working on this issue (at multiple levels, albeit in a fragmentary way) for the last three decades and more, it is hardly enough: I am painfully aware of this. However, my intended note on Adhyatma will take this quest one step further. It is only through such small steps that I hope to make clear to others what I think is the case: the way Indian traditions look at human beings is far, far superior to anything else we have in the marketplace today.\nAs of now, all I can say is that, yes, one can be a bhakta of Rama, or Krishna, or Anjaneya or whoever without answering questions about their \u0026lsquo;historicity\u0026rsquo;. And that such a stance is more logical and more coherent than the western stance about the same issue.\n","tags":[],"title":"Historicity of Rama, Krishna, Anjaneya","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/historicity-of-rama-krishna-anjaneya-s-n-balagangadhara/"},{"categories":["History","real"],"content":"One of the debates in the Indian traditions is about the kind of creatures that exist in the world and about the reality of what exists. The Jains, for instance, disagreed that the \u0026ldquo;deva\u0026rsquo;s\u0026rdquo; of other traditions (with the properties they were supposed to possess) existed in this world or were real. (Their so-called \u0026lsquo;atheism\u0026rsquo; is a result of this debate.) Consequently, when they call Valmiki Ramayana false, they are making claims about the logical falsehood. They did not, on the basis of some or another empirical enquiry, establish that Ravana was a vegetarian or that Rakshasas were human beings (in fact, in many parts of India, people believe that Ravana was both a Brahmin and a rakshasa at the same time) or that Rama was different from what Valmiki said he was. The same applies to Anjaneya: the claim of some or another author that he was a human being and was married does not either \u0026lsquo;prove\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;disprove\u0026rsquo; the claim of Valmiki.\nThus, if we want to use the Jain Ramayanas to claim that Indians were also doing \u0026lsquo;history\u0026rsquo;, we need to do more than show that they called Valmiki\u0026rsquo;s Ramayana false. They were speaking of logical (and thus contingent) falsehoods; they were not making contingent claims on the basis of empirical research.

Some Jati\u0026rsquo;s are organized as some kind of legal or semi-legal associations, some Jati\u0026rsquo;s are not.\nAre there conflicts between groups of people in India? Yes, there are.

No, they are not. Over the last two thousand years, some Jati\u0026rsquo;s have disappeared, some new ones have come into existence.\nIs it possible to classify all the Jati\u0026rsquo;s that exist in India hierarchically using some or another set of criteria? This question does not allow an unambiguous answer: may be it is possible, may be it is not. The British tried to develop such a classificatory system, which they called `the caste system\u0026rsquo;, and gave up on this attempt after about 30 years.\nIs the English word \u0026lsquo;caste\u0026rsquo; used to translate the Indian word \u0026lsquo;Jati\u0026rsquo;? Yes, many use it as a synonym. Increasingly, however, some find this translation inadequate because the word \u0026lsquo;caste\u0026rsquo; cannot distinguish between \u0026lsquo;Varna\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;Jati\u0026rsquo;. Besides, using the word \u0026lsquo;sub-caste\u0026rsquo; suggests the existence of a super-ordinate and a subordinate \u0026lsquo;caste\u0026rsquo;, whereas \u0026lsquo;Jati\u0026rsquo; does not suggest this.\nWhat is a \u0026lsquo;Varna\u0026rsquo; and what is its relationship to \u0026lsquo;Jati\u0026rsquo;? No one knows. Some claim that \u0026lsquo;Jati\u0026rsquo; is a sub-division within the \u0026lsquo;Varnas\u0026rsquo;, some claim that there is no relationship between the two, yet others suggest that Jati\u0026rsquo;s exist only in some Varna\u0026rsquo;s and so on.\nIs Varna a hierarchical social system in India with \u0026lsquo;Brahmins\u0026rsquo; occupying the top of this hierarchy with Sudra\u0026rsquo;s at the bottom and a social group that finds itself outside this \u0026lsquo;hierarchy\u0026rsquo;? There is no correlation between the \u0026lsquo;Varnas\u0026rsquo; and occupation; there is no correlation between \u0026lsquo;Varna\u0026rsquo; and political power. Therefore, it is not possible to suggest that \u0026lsquo;Varna\u0026rsquo; is a social system, hierarchical or otherwise. Furthermore, it is not clear what \u0026lsquo;Varnas\u0026rsquo; are or what criteria have to be used to classify people into Varnas. If one uses \u0026lsquo;birth\u0026rsquo; as a criterion (that is, one says that one\u0026rsquo;s parents have to belong to one of the Varnas in order to `qualify\u0026rsquo; as a member of that Varna), then the vast majority of Indians fall outside this classificatory framework. (This group would include Jains, Buddhists, Christians, Muslims, Lingayats, many Saivites, some Viashnavites, and so on.) From this it follows that whatever \u0026lsquo;Varnas\u0026rsquo; are, such a classificatory system cannot be a social system because it fails to classify the majority of the people in a society. Therefore, no one specific social group falls outside this \u0026lsquo;system\u0026rsquo; but many, many groups.\nIf any on this board disagree with the answers to the above questions, I would like to know what their answers are. I presuppose their truth for the time being. None of the above claims is the result of my research; this is something that everyone on this board (who has more than merely a passing acquaintance with India) knows. (I presume the truth of the last statement as well.)\n","tags":[],"title":"Jati, Varna and Caste","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/jati-varna-and-caste/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","caste"],"content":"You say: \u0026ldquo;If \u0026lsquo;caste\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;jati\u0026rsquo; has the same status as alumni associations and similar social groups, with their varying practices, it seems we are prepared to say that \u0026lsquo;jati\u0026rsquo; has no special place in the Indian society in the same way that my alumni association has no special status in Indian society.\u0026rdquo; This sentence is the problematic one.\nFirst of all, it does not follow (either empirically or logically) that if Jati is a social group much like alumini associations, trades unions, etc it has no special status in Indian society. That depends upon the role, function and the nature of such social groups and these are issues for empirical investigation. For instance, the \u0026ldquo;old boys\u0026rdquo; network\u0026quot; in Britian (comprising of aluminis from public schools and Oxbridge students) apparently plays a very important role in the British society. In certain circles of power in India, alumminis from private schools (like the Doon school, Lawrence school) and colleges like St. Stephens have built sophisticated networks that function like service clubs. In this sense, one cannot claim that alumini networks, by virtue of their composition, do not have a special status in a society. This is an empirical question. Your alumini association might indeed have no special place; that does not preclude some other alumini association from having an important place. (Similarly, by virtue of the fact that some particular trade union does not have a special status in Indian society, it is not possible to make claims about whether trades unions have a special status or not.)\nSecondly, all of us routinely distinguish between a domain of study and several approaches or theories used to study the domain. (If \u0026lsquo;gravitational force\u0026rsquo; is the domain of study, we have had a number of theories that have studied this domain.) In our case too, we need to keep this in mind: jati is the domain of study and there are theories in the market place that claim that the \u0026lsquo;system of caste\u0026rsquo; is synonymous with the social structure of India. Denying this set of theories does not entail denying either the existence of jati\u0026rsquo;s or the presence of a social structure in India.\nThirdly, just because people deny the Aristotelean theory about falling bodies, they are not committed to deny the experience that unsupported bodies (on earth) fall downwards. By denying one set of theories about the caste system (or even all of them), I am not committed to deny any experience, whether they are horror stories or stories of oppression or whatever else. Furthermore, I am not even denying that jati practices cover many things: from commensality to marriages. These are issues for further empirical (which are these practices and where) and theoretical (what role do these practices play in sustaining and reproducing a social structure) investigation.\nAll I am committed to is the following claim: the dominant western story about \u0026rsquo;the caste system\u0026rsquo; is false, if taken as an explanation of the Indian society.\n","tags":[],"title":"The dominant story about the ‘caste system’","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/the-dominant-story-about-the-caste-system/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","caste"],"content":"I would like to pick up the thread on ‘the caste system’ and begin at the beginning. Let us find out what we are discussing about and disagreeing with.\nAssuming for this entire post, ‘caste’ is an English word for ‘Jati’, the first question is:\n1. Are there Jati’s in India?\nYes, of course, there are. No one is denying this obvious fact.\n2. Is there a system of Jati in India?\nThis question is ambiguous because it is unclear what ‘system’ means in this context. It could mean many things. This question, therefore, can only be answered when someone tells us what a social structure or social system is. There are many senses in which these terms (‘system’ and ‘structure’) are used: one speaks of democratic structures of a polity, social structure of a Feudal society, the Capitalist social system, kinship and family structures, the system of nuclear family, and so on. Given this plurality of uses, it becomes necessary to specify very clearly the sense in which the jatis are not only a system but also a social system.\n3. Is it possible to describe (or classify) all the jati’s in India as though all jati\u0026rsquo;s are related to each other?\nLet us assume ‘relations’ to mean: hierarchical relationship, part-whole relationship, hetararchical relationship, relation of descent, kinship etc. In that case, once one has specified what kind of relationship one ‘wants’ between all the jati’s, then the answer can be given. My hypothesis is: No, it is not possible to describe all the jati’s in such a manner.\nOr, the second question could mean:\n4. Do all the Jati’s, together, form a ‘structure’ of sorts?\nAgain, the issue is what this structure is: mathematical structure, logical structure, or whatever else. I do not know, because no one has specified what kind of structure Jati’s (in their entirety) are supposed to exemplify.\n5. Is Jati a social system or a social structure?\nThis question can only be answered when someone tells us what a social structure or social system is. There are many senses in which these terms are used: one speaks of democratic structures of a polity, social structure of a Feudal society, the Capitalist social system, kinship and family structures, the system of nuclear family, and so on. Given this plurality of uses, it becomes necessary to specify very clearly the sense in which the Jati’s are not only a system but also a social system.\nIn short, after the first question, the discussion about jati’s is mired in ambiguities, table-thumping, and flag waving. Perhaps, it is best if people begin by getting a handle on the second question before coming up with anecdotes.\n","tags":[],"title":"Caste and Caste system","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/caste-and-caste-system/"},{"categories":["adhoc","Balagangadhara","History","stories"],"content":"Today, both in India and abroad, we see the emergence of a new intellectual trend: based on painstaking research, to write an accurate history of India. What is new about this approach? In one sense, as I shall explain in this article, this attempt is not novel; in another sense, which too shall be explained, there is something very new in it. I shall talk about both in the course of answering the question raised in the title, which contrasts ‘the past’ with ‘a history’. This contrast needs explication because historiography is seen as an ‘accurate recording of the past’. Yet, I am going to contrast the product of historiography, ‘a history’, with something called ‘the past’.\nThe story I will pen has contemporaneous relevance: this issue was at the centre of the Ayodhya temple controversy and now it is back with the claims about Rama Sethu. Some people want to make claims from our legends and stories into historical truths and their opponents want to suggest that stories like Ramayana do not have any historical truth. Even though these two appear each other’s opponents, I want to suggest that they are brothers and kins underneath. The Sangh Parivar and the Indian ‘secularists’ share the same bed, eat the same food and mouth the same story. And primarily it is their story that I want to tell.\nHowever, this story is complicated: it has at least two beginnings, two middle points and one common end. There are many branches to this story and, although this is not enough, I will even talk of an alternative. In a way, to an Indian audience, this should not pose a problem: the story of Mahabharata is not unitary; there are stories within stories with multiple narrators and voices, and many synchronous events. I am not a Vyasa to keep you captivated by my narration, even though I wish I were. Unlike his epic, this article is both short and requires a sequel. My hope is to write that sequel in the course of the foreseeable future. However, these are my failings. I hope you are still Indian enough to find the time to give me a hearing and that you have not become all hustle and bustle the way the westerners are.\nA first beginning\nA few thousand years ago, two intellectual movements existed simultaneously in the Ancient Greek society. The first, with a venerable past, was exemplified by the bards: these were the story-tellers, who moved from town to town recounting Greek legends and mythologies. The bards drew reasonably large crowds wherever they went; they did not merely entertain the audience by recounting Homer and other respected poets but also, through the act of story-telling, addressed the actual problems of their society. They told stories of long ago: Ulysses and the Sirens, Cyclops and Zeus, and about Jason and the Argonauts. The characters in such stories were both human and divine; some among them faced insurmountable challenges; their deeds were, therefore, considered heroic. The poets, it was said, rightly immortalized them. The bards cherished telling such stories and the crowds loved hearing them.\nAnd then, there was another group as well. For the sake of convenience, let us call them philosophers (those who loved wisdom). We know the names of many such; one of them, the most well-known, is Plato. This philosopher was not happy, either with the bards or with what they did. He felt that the bards incited the crowd into irrational behaviour based on irrational feelings. Instead of inculcating reasonableness, Plato thought, these bards pandered to the emotions of people. Emotions were always bad advisors, especially if they concerned matters of polity. He opposed educating the children (who would be the future Athenians) by teaching them legends and mythologies because such stories, according to Plato, always exaggerated, distorted and lied about the past. In fact, Plato envisioned an ideal state that would ban all the poets and bards into exile; such a state, ruled by a philosopher-king, would be the polis to live in because it alone cultivated reason among its citizens. He opposed ‘myth’ to ‘history’, and ‘emotions’ to ‘reason’. He believed that not myths but history should guide the behaviour of the civilized Athenians. He saw the bards as ‘orators’ and counterposed ‘rhetoric’ (the art of speech) of his time to ‘reason’. Oration cultivated demagogy (that which appealed to the irrationality and the emotions of the crowd) and thus poisoned the youth, whereas philosophy cultivated reason.\nThese two tendencies were apparently each other’s rivals in the Athens of so-long-ago. However, before either of the tendencies could gain dominance, the Greek civilization collapsed. In the future, the torch lit in Athens would be carried only partially by the Roman Empire.\nA Second Beginning\nWe now move the tale forward by a few centuries. At that time, the Roman Empire included many parts of what we now call the Middle-East. Romans had also conquered Judea, a nation of people called the Jews. Like all other nations of the world, the Jews too had a story about their own past. Their story told them of the travails of the Jews, comprising of twelve tribes, who were scattered among other nations as a punishment. The punisher is an entity that we now call ‘God’ and He punished the Jews for forgetting Him, the ‘God of Israel’. He is the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. He is the creator and sovereign of the Universe, and the Jews were instructed to keep the Law He gave them. He instructed them too in the difference between Himself (the ‘True’ God) and ‘gods’ of other nations and peoples, and revealed Himself in Mount Sinai. Being the merciful God that He is, He also promised the children of Israel that He would send down to earth a messenger, who would unite the Jews together again.\nThis caricature of a story about the Jewish past will do for the moment because what is interesting here is not the story itself but the attitude of the Jews towards it. Unlike the Greeks of yesteryears, the Jews of yesterday and today believe that theirs is a true story. In fact, they do not consider this as a story at all: to them, it is the factual chronicle of events on earth. In other words, their account of their past, the Jews believe, is history. God – the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob – did punish the Jews; God did promise to send His own messenger (‘the promised one’, Christos is a Greek word) to earth, and that this messenger will come because God always keeps His promises.\nIn the course of time, some Jews began to proclaim the arrival of such messengers of God. Many said that the Messiah had come to earth at God’s behest to save the children of Israel. The most well-known group among them crystallized around the person and acts of Jesus of Nazareth. Believing that Jesus was the Christ (the announced, the messiah, the anointed), this group tried to persuade the Jews about his arrival. Most of the Jews did not buy the idea that Jesus was the Christ. Largely rejected by the Jews, this group then proclaimed that Jesus had come to earth not just to save the Jews but to save the entire Humankind. The Jewish accounts of their past, their history, had already spoken of the Original Sin, Eternal Damnation, Hell and Heaven. The Christians (i.e., those who believed that Jesus of Nazareth was the Christ) took most of it over but accused the Jews of heresy and a signal failure to understand their own scriptures. They believed that Judaism was dead and would be soon replaced by Christianity, a creed professed by the Christians, i.e. those who proclaimed the arrival of the messenger of God, his death on the cross for the sins of mankind and his resurrection three days later. This was the ‘Good News’ that the Christians proclaimed to the world at large.\nThis too is a caricature of Christianity but, again, I want to draw your attention to not only how the Christians looked at these chronicles but also to how they were and are compelled to look at it.\nMuch like the Jews, the early Christians also believed that their story about their past was not just their history but also the history of mankind. Every event that was chronicled in the Old Testament Bible, from Adam and Eve through the Garden of Eden and the Flood to Noah’s ark, they believed, narrated the facts and events on earth. Adam did commit the Original Sin (as it is narrated in the Old Testament Bible) by thirsting after the knowledge of good an evil and the children and descendents of Adam (the entire humankind) do carry this burden. The Christians claimed that Jesus of Nazareth was the Christ; he was crucified by the Romans; he did rise from death three days later and promised humankind ‘salvation’, if they followed him. Those who did not, the disciples of Jesus maintained, would be eternally damned to Hell, the Biblical Hell, ruled by the Devil.\nApart from the Jews, who were sceptical and dismissive of the claims of Jesus to Christhood, the Christians also confronted the intellectuals of the Roman Empire. Among other things, these intellectuals found that the Christians were making ridiculous claims about ‘God’, ‘the Devil’ and Jesus of Nazareth. Even though they tolerated the Jewish customs and traditions, they never accepted the story of the Jews as the history of humankind. In Christians, they not only found a silly sect that claimed that some entity called ‘God’ could create whatever He wanted just by ‘willing’ it into existence but also a new group that made ridiculous assertions about resurrection after death. Jesus must have been a magician, they thought, who merely pretended to die while convincing the gullible that he was ‘really dead’. Who had ever heard of someone being resurrected after death? Among other things, they thought that Christians were simple minded fools, who ran away from all discussions and tried to ‘convert’ only the children, slaves and women. (None of these three, the Romans thought, was able to ‘reason’ the way a mature citizen could.)\nCaught between the hammer and the anvil, the Christians had to insist more and more vigorously that they were telling the truth. Theirs was not a story or a myth but the history instead. It was not just the history of the Jewish nation without it being the history of the whole of humankind. The Christian God was not merely the ‘God of Israel’, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and their descendents, but ‘the God’ of the whole of humankind. He became the generic ‘God’: singular, unqualified, and unique. He was ‘God’. He created the Cosmos; He is the Lord and Master of the World; He is the Sovereign and the fountainhead of all morality. His Will was the Law and, as His creatures, we have to obey Him.\nWhy, then, do different nations have and worship different ‘gods’? This was easily explained: all these ‘gods’ were ‘false’; as followers and lieutenants of the Devil, these false gods lead mankind towards destruction. They were vagrant ‘spirits’, the daimones of the Greeks from which the English word ‘Demons’ is derived. The Greeks, of course, did not think of their gods either as vagrant spirits or as the followers of the Biblical Satan or the Devil. Neither did the Romans. However, the Christians added their own spin to the Greco-Roman thought and, with the conversion of the Emperor Constantine, they also gained political power.\nIn other words, according to Christianity, the Biblical story is the ‘true’ history of the whole of humankind. Jesus of Nazareth had to be a real, historical person crucified by the Romans. The Christians believed furthermore that the stories that other peoples and nations told about their multiple pasts were just that: myths and legends but not history. Bible was History. It was the history of the humankind. Period.\nThe First Middle Point\nThere are two middle points I want to talk about. The first is the cognitive attitude one assumes with respect to looking at the past of a group. The second is about the attitude one has to the multiple ways in which human groups have, in fact, looked at their own pasts. Let me begin with the first.\nConsider what happens when you look at actions and events in the world as expressions of God’s will. Assume too that this will intends something with such actions and events and that this ‘something’ pertains to the future of human kind. Because, as human beings, our perspective about the present is more limited than our ability to gather records about the past, we can write fuller chronicles about the past. Furthermore, these narratives are important for discerning God’s plan in the events of the past. Such knowledge is extremely crucial to determining the course of actions in the future, as far as we human beings are concerned. The Christians discovered very soon during their existence that the world was not going to come to an immediate end, an end which they hoped to see. Consequently, their problem became: what did God (and Christ) intend with human ‘history’? In the events of the past, which was Christ acting in human history, they were provided with signs that required interpretation. In so far as God’s will is revealed in the world (including in human history), it becomes the tasks of men to study the same to find out what God intends. God’s will is also revealed in the chronicles of the human past. However, it is imperative to studying God’s revelation that one studies what actually happened in the past. Only when we study the past as it actually occurred, only then could we hope to decipher what God intends for the human kind. An imaginary past is no substitute for an accurate rendering of the same. Not merely is such a past no substitute; the situation is even worse: by studying false chronicles about the past as though they were true, one endangers the very possibility of the salvation of the human soul.\nThe Bible, however, had already chronicled the human past. What was new, after Jesus Christ, was the emergence of the Christian Church. Consequently, one needed to chronicle the history of this institution as something that fulfilled God’s plan on earth in much the same way one chronicled the coming of Jesus of Nazareth as the culmination of the strivings of the nations. Eusebius, the famous Church historian, accomplished both: one in his writings on the history of the Church and the other by showing how the ‘wise’ and ‘noble’ of the pagans from other cultures had actually, if only implicitly, anticipated the arrival of the Messiah.\nIt was left to St. Augustine to come up with the definitive framework from within which to study the human past. This philosophy of history suggested looking at the growth of the Christian ecclesia as the historical expression of God’s plan. This community of believers (the Christian ecclesia, that is), to Augustine and his followers, was bigger than any empirical society of Christians at any given moment of time. It incorporated the entire set of believers, past, present and future. It was a grand philosophy of history that once and for all set the foundations to answering the question: how ‘ought’ one to study the past? Even more important than this fact is the following: he would make a very counter-intuitive attitude into a trivial ‘but, of course!’ The last sentence needs some explication.\nConsider the following question: why talk about the past at all? Or, why do human communities feel the need of talking about the past of their communities? These and analogous questions are raised in order to make the human present representable to those who live. Why represent the past and present to ourselves at all? An answer to this question requires appealing to some kind of an idea about what it is to live as a human being, what we aim at in life and why. Because we are interested in human flourishing (“live a good life”, whatever ‘good’ means in this context), we need to think about ourselves as beings with some kind of a past. In other words, one looks at the past for the sake of living well and flourishing in the present. In most groups that have evolved into cultures, some kind of an implicit consensus is present regarding what human flourishing is, that is, what it means to live a good life. This consensus is as general and as abstract as the question itself (‘human flourishing means to be happy’). In this sense, each human group has some kind of story about its past.\nHowever, St. Augustine formulated the question about the past within the Christian theological framework. That is to say, he formulated a theological question as though the query about the past was indissolubly connected with the ‘truth’ of a story about the past. As I have outlined it earlier on, to the Jews and the Christians, it was imperative that their claims about the past were ‘true’. If such claims were false, and the humankind acted in the present on the basis these falsehoods, its future was eternal damnation. Thus, to St. Augustine, it was very obvious that there was only attitude possible with respect to the past. Such an attitude sought the ‘true’ past: it was an attitude that answered the question “how ‘ought’ one to study the past”? One ‘ought’ to study the past in such a way as to find the true past. This ‘true’ past had to be found through a painstaking study (of scriptures and the writings of the early church fathers), said Augustine, because mankind has been deceived into believing the lies told by the Devil about the human past. In short, because lies about the past abound in human communities (these ‘lies’ are, of course, the stories that human groups have about their own multiple pasts), one needs ‘the truth’. The Bible was the only repository of this ‘truth’, as far as Augustine was concerned.\nBecause ‘truth’ is what all human beings like to seek, today it has become obvious to talk as though one seeks truth while one studies the past. Two important issues need to be understood here. There is, first, the question why study the past at all? There is, second, the problem of what ‘truth’ means in this context.\nConsider the first issue. Why ‘study’ the past instead of recounting your community’s story about the past? I mean, why are we not satisfied in recounting Ramayana, Mahabharata, puranas, etc as our stories about our past? What do we need to study and why? To these questions, there is a plausible sounding answer: ‘we need to know whether these stories are true’. Ask again why: Why do we need to know whether these stories are true? After all, as we believe, these stories have been in circulation for millennia and they have adequately and admirably met the needs of our ancestors (and most of our contemporaries as well) in their quest for human flourishing. So, what extra reasons exist to ‘study’ the past?\nHere is the first possible answer, which takes the form of a question: what if our stories about the past turn out to be false? Let me answer it with a counter-question: so what? What does it matter whether what we believe about our past is true or false as long as it helps us in human flourishing? One can choose truth above falsehood if (a) truth about the past helps us live better as human beings and (b) falsehood damages us. Without answering these questions, one cannot provide extra reasons to study the past.\nHere is a second possible answer that attempts to sidestep the issue: “we need to know the truth about the past because only as such do we have knowledge about the past. We do not need to justify this knowledge about the past any further because, surely, knowledge is its own justification.” However, this answer too does not work. Why?\nThis brings us to the second issue. You see, the only intelligible notion of truth we have today is one makes ‘truth’ into a property of sentences, that is, into a linguistic property. (That is to say, it is only of sentences that we can say whether they are true or false.) Even though we do use the notion of truth in multiple other ways (when we say of someone that ‘he is a true friend’ or when we say ‘only truth is the real’ and such like), we are incapable (today) of fleshing out these, other notions of ‘truth’. In this sense, there are repositories of truth in existence today: the multiple telephone directories in the world. Such books are embodiments of ‘the truth’ about the world. Consequently, ‘the truth’ which the historians seek could only be the analogues of telephone directories from the past. While one does not have any objection to collecting factoids about the past, what have these to do with ‘knowledge’, except in a trivial sense of that word?\nOne might disagree by pointing to ‘historical explanations’. Do these not constitute knowledge? No, they do not. In the first place, all such explanations are ad hoc: one does not generate knowledge by sucking some explanation out of one’s thumb to ‘account’ for the facts already collected, no matter how large that set of facts might be. Second, such explanations do not explain: they merely insinuate some kind of connection between facts and some implicit thesis. Third, invariably, such a thesis is some or another commonsense variant of (or garden variety) psychological or sociological ‘explanation’. Fourth, the assembled facts cannot, in any way, testify to ‘the truth’ of the implicit thesis. As a consequence, except for being ad hoc stories about the past, such ‘explanations’ do not even clarify the nature of ‘historical explanations’.\nIn fact, there is a radical disjunction between what the historians think they are doing (‘seeking explanations about the past’) and what they do (collect factoids). When he seeks ‘the truth’ about the past, neither the historian nor his reader knows whether he has found it or even why it has to be ‘found’. The ‘archives’ of the historian is not some kind of ‘collective memory’ of the humankind. It is what it always was: a collection of records that sits in a library shelf slowly gathering dust.\nThe ‘truth’ that St. Augustine sought can never be proved or disproved by any kind of research in the ‘archives’. His ‘truth’ was about the Christ nature of Jesus of Nazareth and about the Bible. His predecessors had established that Jesus of Nazareth existed and their theologies had proved that he was The Messiah. Therefore, he claimed that one ‘ought’ to study the past on the basis of this knowledge. What sense does it make to take over his theological question and try to garnish it with ‘secular’ sounding dogmas?\nThe Second Middle Point\nIn 1160, Peter Comestor – the then chancellor of Notre Dame of Paris – wrote Historia Scholastica, a book that enjoyed tremendous popularity in all parts of Europe. As an appendix to his sacred history, Peter condenses some of the ‘mytho­logi­cal’ material into a series of short chapters, or inci­dentiae. In these, he looks at some of the ‘mythological’ figures in the following way: Zoroaster, for instance, invented magic and inscribed the seven arts on four columns; Isis taught the Egyptians the letters of the Alphabet and showed them how to write; Minerva taught sev­eral arts, in par­ticular weav­ing; Prometheus probably instructed the ignorant or fabricated automata. All these mighty spirits, suggests Peter Comestor, are worthy of veneration, as are the patriarchs, and for the same reason: they have been the guides and teachers of humanity, and together stand as the common ancestors of civilization.\nThis way of looking at stories about other people’s past represents one end of the spectrum. At the other end stands a disparaging attitude towards all such narratives. For instance, this is exemplified by Sir Babbington Macaulay, in his famous minutes con­cerning the need for a British education system in India:\nIt is, I believe, no exaggeration to say that all the historical infor­ma­tion that has been collected to form all the books written in the Sanskrit lan­guage is less valuable than what may be found in the most paltry abridge­ments used at preparatory schools in Eng­land\u0026hellip;\nThe question before us is merely whether when we can patronize \u0026hellip; sound history, (or) we shall countenance, at the public expense, \u0026hellip; his­tory, abounding with kings thirty feet high, and reigns thirty thousand years long – and geogra­phy, made up of seas of treacle and butter (cited in Keay, John, 1981, India Discovered. London: Collins, 1988: p. 77, my emphasis).\nIn the spectrum that I am constructing for the purposes of this piece, these two attitudes reveal two faces of the same coin. One face looks at the tales of the past of their peoples and cultures as disguised historical narration but discovers some ‘kernel’ of truth in such narrations. It assumes, in a manner of speaking, that other people somehow did not know how to compose historical narratives (or did not care to do so) and that one has to ‘interpret’ these stories to extract the ‘truth’ from such stories. This is how, for example, the European intellectuals looked at the Greek myths during the Italian Renaissance. They felt that the Greek legends talked of human virtues but that these narratives represented such virtues (like courage, bravery, generosity, justice, etc) in the form of ‘heroes’ and ‘gods’. So, one had to ‘sympathetically’ read the myths and the legends of the Ancient Greek society to really understand what they are trying to say.\nThe ‘heroes’ of the European Enlightenment, by contrast, exemplify the second face of the coin. In their ‘Quarrel with the Ancients’, they were vitriolic in their assessment of the achievements of the Ancient Greek society, especially their myths and legends. Opposed to these myths and legends, which were mere stories and products of wild human imagination, stand ‘facts’ and ‘history’. One merely reads these stories for ‘entertainment’; to ascribe to them any other status is to live under an illusion. They were lies about the past which the poets constructed. The Ancients, with the exception of historians like Thucydides, really produced myths and legends. Instead of enlightening us about ‘what the past was really like’, these stories deceive us.\nCommon to both these attitudes is the idea that we ‘ought not’ to take these stories about the past seriously. Such stories are not about the past; these are merely products of the human imagination. Only historiography can teach us about the past and, if we care about the past at all, we should care about ‘history’. In other words, what these two attitudes say is the following: they claim that our stories about the past are not about anything real. They do not speak about objects or events in the world. If we are perceptive enough, these stories tell us something about the world of the authors indirectly; they do also tell us about the nature of human imagination. In and of themselves, these stories are really about nothing. If this is true, huge questions open up which they never even address: why did people from earlier generations produce all those stories? Why, instead of talking about the world, did they write only fiction? If Thucydides could write empirical history, why could Valmiki or Vyasa not be able to do the same? And so on.\nThere is something else too that unites them: the belief that they hold the key to the past and that they know how the past ‘ought to’ be studied. To Comestor, his theology had given him the certainty; to people like Macaulay (and to the enlightenment thinkers), it was equally obvious that they knew how to study the past, whereas the earlier generations did not. Do not read them amiss: the ‘heroes’ of the enlightenment were not defending some or another scientific orientation for appreciating the human past. Much like that of Peter Comestor, theirs too was a theological attitude. In which way?\nOne of the bones of contention between the Catholics and the Protestants was about ‘miracles’. The Catholic Church believed that miracles occurred in the world: in fact, to this day, the Catholics believe that transubstantiation occurs during the Holy Mass, where bread and wine get transubstantiated into the flesh and blood of Christ. They further believe in the intervention of deceased saints in the world: in fact, they attribute miraculous powers to some shrines and relics as well. Arraigned against them and this attitude towards miracles were the Protestants: they denied any such interventions, attributed miracles only to Godhead and had withering contempt for the beliefs about the powers of shrines and relics. In short, their theologies persuaded the Protestants to look at the human past as something that required a different kind of study than even those which the Catholics engaged in. At best, human past consisted of merely those deeds which human beings could perform. Nothing ‘supernatural’ occurs in human history; after all, the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ (and the miracles he performed) had nothing to do with human beings. The Bible records all the interventions of God (these, after all, are the ‘miracles’) and anything else is a mere human addition to the human past. Any talk of miracles outside of what is recorded in the Bible reflects the disease of the human mind. If anything at all, the history of humanity chronicles their corruption; it is a story of their fall, foibles and follies. Human past is and ‘ought to be’ a mere record of what human beings could do and, ‘in truth’, have achieved. Human history does not edify; at best, it disappoints. Any human flourishing that we might want is not provided by stories about the past. Such stories merely lie and mislead. ‘History’ of the human past is merely a chronicle of the kind of creatures we are. To think that narratives about the human past can teach us how to live or how to be happy or how to flourish as human beings is to assign to historiography a power that it does not possess and could never hope to possess.\nOnly God’s Grace, which is what ‘true religion’ is, can pull us out of the misery that the human past, present and future is. It is the task of the ‘true religion’ to tell us what happiness is and how to reach it. To think differently is to arrogate the status and power of God to human beings. The enlightenment thinkers merely reproduced (garbed, of course, in a fashion appropriate to their times) this theological stance towards the human past. Macaulay is a child of this Protestant attitude to the human past. What we call today as a ‘historical attitude’; our ideas about why study the human past; how we ‘ought to’ do that; these are all solidly rooted in Protestant Christianity. That is, it is both Christian (thus partially shared by the Catholics and the Protestants) and Protestant.\nThe Common End\nUnder the colonial rule, the British aggressively pushed their beliefs onto us. They quizzed us about our past in ways we were not used to before. Taking our multiple stories, epics and puranans as though they were historiographies, they derided us for believing in their ‘truth’. Our intellectuals, whose story under the colonial rules (both Islamic and British) is a sad story of succumbing to what they did not understand, broadly took the only two paths available to them: either deny the truth of such stories or try and show that these stories were ‘true’ chronicles of the past. It did not occur to these intellectuals to study the culture of these colonizers and figure out what kinds of questions the colonizers were asking. They merely assumed that the attitudes of the colonial masters were exemplifications of reason, rationality and scientificity. In the first phase, our intellectuals accepted the absence of historiography in the Indian traditions and set out to solve that lacuna by writing histories of India. Of course, these were based completely and totally on the ‘philosophy of history’ that the Europeans sold at steeply discounted prices on the Indian continent. In the second phase, they joined the Europeans in deriding the Indian traditions and the stock of stories about the past. In the third phase, they simply took over the European historiography of India and went on to garnish it with Indian spices, which merely meant adding new ‘empirical details’, as and when one ‘discovered’ them. In this sense, the attitude of writing a history of Indian culture and civilization, based on a meticulous ‘study’ of the past is not anything new. It is an old knee-jerk reaction to the Protestant critique of the Indian culture and traditions.\nWhat do these historiographies accomplish? They teach us, for instance, that the Mahabharata war could have taken place, except, of course, it was probably a war between a collection of tribes. It is merely the poetic exaggeration that has provided us with a description of epic proportions. So, in all probability, these historians assure us, there was some kind of a war, somewhere in the north of India about a few thousand years ago. As far as Krishna lifting the mountain with his little finger or about Ghatotkacha fighting the war with ‘the magic’ of the Rakshasas, they do not even bother to hide the snigger: of course, it is all either nonsense or mere poetic exaggeration. Surely, we know that no human individual can lift the mountain with his little finger and, in all probability, the ‘Rakshasas’ was the name of another tribe, which, perhaps, was neutral in this tribal war. In other words, Mahabharata and Ramayana (and all our stories about the past) are merely disguised historiographies or lies and exaggerations of our incompetent ancestors (‘incompetent’ because they could not even do what Thucydides did or the Chinese did so many thousands of years ago) which only the current generation of historians can decipher.\nIn one sense, until recently, the damage was limited. It was limited because this group of historians shared the deep, Nehruvian contempt for Indian culture and her traditions. They strutted around in the enclaves of elite universities, flew to international conferences to present their papers there and, generally speaking, felt much above the rest of the Indian ‘masses’ steeped in ignorance and superstition. Not knowing about their own profound ignorance of the origin, nature and meaning of these ‘scientific’ questions, these historians were content to reproduce whatever their Metropolitan masters wanted. They had built a wall of separation between their ‘secularism’ and the ‘religiosity’ of the Indian masses.\nToday, especially in the last decades, the picture has changed drastically and alarmingly. It is important for us to understand this latest development.\nBoth British ‘liberalism’ and the Nehruvian ‘secularism’ brought another reaction into existence in India. We are familiar with one kind: the kind that derides Indian culture, her traditions and holds the West as the picture of perfection. These people have been dominant in the press and the universities for centuries long. But, I want to talk about its antipode: a tendency that too is a child of British Protestantism, Christian to the core, but one which borrows from other strands available in the European Christianity.\nThis tendency goes the other way: it claims that our stories about the past are literally our histories. We too have historiographers from the past, we too know ‘the truth’ about our past, what we say about our past is the literal ‘truth’ and they are not poetic lies or exaggerations. Enter the Sangh Parivar.\nThe Sangh Parivar, actually, is a confluence of at least two orientations. On the one hand, it intuitively reacts to the Christian descriptions of Indian culture. It senses that there is something profound about Indian culture, her traditions, her multiple stories about the past, and so on. It senses too that there are various ways of being on earth and that the Christian and the Muslim ways of ‘being-in-the-world’ are but two out of many different ways. And it reacts with incomprehension as well, while listening to the criticisms of the religiously founded ‘secular’ criticisms of everything Indian. But, it is also profoundly and deeply ignorant of the western culture.\nOn the other hand, for reasons I am not fully clear about, the Sangh Parivar has no intellectuals. It merely has ideologues. Lacking the ability to do intellectual research, these ideologues of the Sangh Parivar pick up whatever is readily available. Two such things are readily available: nationalism and the Christian stories about history. The ideologues of the Sangh Parivar have picked them both.\nOf course, in picking them both, the Sangh Parivar was forced by its own logic of wanting to suggest that Ramayana was the factual truth. Because it merely possesses ideologues, the Parivar was unable to face the challenges the ‘secularists’ confronted them with. Instead of taking issue with the way these secularists formulated the problem, the ideologues of the Parivar swallowed the secular articulation of the problem hook, line and sinker. The result is anything but salutary.\nThese two things, when mixed together, are catastrophic in nature. The ideologues of the Sangh Parivar threaten to do what centuries of colonialism tried but could not accomplish: destroy the Indian culture and her traditions irreplaceably and irrevocably. They are going to do that while promising to ‘save’ the Indian culture and her traditions. Let me explain why.\nOur multiple stories about the past, among other things, provide us with a deep connection to a collective past. We read or hear Mahabharata and the Ramayana and we feel that Rama, Duryodhana, Dharmaraja, etc were our kings. When we participate in the festival of Deepavali, we open our doors to Bali, a rakshasa, as the greatest king we ever had. We feel connected to Sita, Draupadi and Abhimanyu. We have wept when we heard the story of Ekalavya; we feel touched by Karna’s fate; we get angry at Shakuni and Dushyasana. We want brothers to be like Rama and Lakshmana. We feel connected to all these people in a myriad of ways and our connection is deeper than our connections to great grandfathers, whom we have never met (in all probability). In short, we feel part of that genealogy which these multiple stories present as our collective past.\nAs children, we have often wondered where these people lived and what languages they spoke in. Did Krishna speak in a local language, Sanskrit or something else totally? In which language did Yaksha ask questions to Dharmaraja? How did Sita or Hanumantha speak to Ravana? How did the rishis and the kings from Khamboja communicate with those from Jambudwipa? Are the nagas of today the descendents of Arjuna, is the Mathura near Delhi also the place where Krishna lived? Are the vanaras that helped Rama the ancestors of those monkeys that we see today? And the Yugas; what are they actually? Is the treta and the dwapara yuga merely how the earth was so many hundreds of thousands of years ago? And so on and so forth.\nAs we grew up and learnt our geographies and sciences, we did try to combine both: how could there be treta yuga when our species is hardly 50,000 years old? How could Bhima really have the strength of 10,000 elephants and Duryodhana merely 9999? How could Dharmaraja ‘walk’ to Swarga and, if he did, why could Trishanku not do the same? And so on as well. We went to our elders with these questions and their answers, which were no answers at all, satisfied us. And, over a period of time, we stopped asking these questions. Not because we knew the answers or that they were unanswerable. But we stopped asking such questions because we learnt, in whichever way we did so, that these were not the right questions to ask. To grow up as an Indian is to learn that these stories should be treated differently than claims from our geography lessons. Finally, we assumed an attitude that was indifferent to the facticity of these stories. We reached a stage where we could endorse the following dialogue between a Swiss-German and a Balinese (from Bichsel, Peter, 1982, Der Leser, Das Erzählen: Frankfurter Poetik-Vorlesungen. Darm­stadt und Neu­wied: Hermann Luchterhand Verlag. Pp. 13-14, my translation and italics):\nWhen I discovered, or when it was explained to me, that Hinduism is a pedagogical religion, namely, that in so far as the best “good deed” of a Hindu consisted of explaining something or the other, I lost my inhi­bi­tions and began with questions\u0026hellip;\nA young Balinese became my primary teacher. One day I asked him if he believed that the history of Prince Rama – one of the holy books of the Hindus – is true. Without hesitation, he answered it with “Yes”. “So you believe that the Prince Rama lived somewhere and somewhen?” “I do not know if he lived”, he said. “Then it is a story?” “Yes, it is a story.” “Then someone wrote this story – I mean: a human being wrote it?” “Certainly some human being wrote it”, he said. “Then some human being could have also invented it”, I answered and felt triumphant, when I thought that I had con­vinced him. But he said: “It is quite possible that somebody invented this story. But true it is, in any case.” “Then it is the case that Prince Rama did not live on this earth?” “What is it that you want to know?” he asked. “Do you want to know whether the story is true, or merely whether it occurred?”\n“The Christians believe that their God Jesus Christ was also on earth”, I said, “In the New Testament, it has been described by human beings. But the Christians believe that this is the descrip­tion of the reality. Their God was also really on Earth.”\nMy Balinese friend thought it over and said: “I had been already so informed. I do not understand why it is important that your God was on earth, but it does strike me that the Euro­peans are not pious. Is that correct?” “Yes, it is”, I said.\nWere we to disagree with the above dialogue, or assume answers we feel comfortable with, even here, the basic point is this: we learnt that our attitudes towards ‘the truth’ of these stories are independent of our acceptance of these stories as our stories and as stories about ‘our collective past’. Whether or not some story about our past took place on earth or not, such a ‘fact’ is utterly irrelevant to accepting these stories. This attitude works as long as we are not brought up with the idea that the ground for accepting such stories is their ‘historical truth’.\nWhat happens when people make claims that ‘rama sethu’ exists, Ayodhya is situated somewhere in northern India and such like? What happens when such ‘historical’ claims begin to find their way into people’s consciousness?\nIn the early phases, there is happiness and euphoria. Not because we can now say, “ah, after all, everything that Ramayana says is true”. But because we feel our connections to the past have taken on tangible presence. We feel that we recognize these empirical markers because we have always been familiar with them. Dwaraka, Brindavana, Kurukshetra, Ayhodhya\u0026hellip; these are our cities and our past. Suddenly, there is exhilaration: it merely requires a few days journey to go to Kurukshetra! However, this is merely the first phase. What happens in the subsequent phase when this claim is pushed further, as it is invariably going to be?\nConsider the following scenario. It becomes common ‘knowledge’ that the war between the Kauravas and the Pandavas was a tribal war, fought somewhere in the north of India some three thousand years ago. And that ‘rakshasa’, ‘vanara’ merely named some or another tribe in India. Krishna was a dark-skinned upstart from some tribe; Rama was a king somewhere up north; Draupadi was a daughter from yet another tribe that practiced polygamy, and so on. In short, we discover that our epics and puranas are badly written historiographies that chronicle the lives of ordinary human beings like you and me. We discover what we knew all along: it is not possible to train the monkeys that swing from tree to tree to build a bridge between India and Sri Lanka.\nThen the ‘Dalit’ and progressive intellectuals turn up. They tell us that some or another ‘Brahminized’ poet merely described the work of the ‘slaves’ of a human king called ‘Rama’ as the work of ‘monkeys’. By calling these slaves as ‘monkeys’, they add, the ‘upper-caste’ proves yet again its disdain and contempt for and the oppression of ‘the Dalits’. As has been typical of the ‘Aryans’, the Brahmin priests were not even willing to consider such ‘slaves’ as human beings. The same argument would then get applied to the Danavas and Rakshasas: we ‘discover’ that the ‘Dravidians’ were the Rakshasas and the Danavas of our epics.\nDo not mistake the point I am making here. No factoid or even a set of factoids will ever lend truth-value to these claims. They would be mere surmises and guesses. But they will get pushed across as ‘scientific’ and ‘historical’ hypotheses that very soon end up becoming ‘facts’ about the Indian past. They will acquire the same status that the ‘Indological’ truths have today. For instance, which intellectual in the world challenges the claim that ‘Buddhism’ battled against ‘Brahmanism’? Almost none. How many know of the circumstances that produced this ‘guesswork’ or even about the amount of Christian theological baggage required to sustain this claim? Alas, hardly any.\nIn exactly the same way, with such stories accompanying the growth of a new generation, which one of them will ever want to become a Bhakta of Rama, Krishna or Anjaneya? How many will go to their temples or even build them? When they grow up in the knowledge that ‘kurukshetra’ names a place somewhere in North India where the local tribes from the region fought a war fought during 500 B.C.E; when they grow up in the knowledge that a tribe called ‘Nagas’, from some remote part of India, also figure in an imaginary epic whose authoritative critical edition is published by some or another University Press in the US; when they ‘know’ that the local events in some remote city (Bikaner, Ayodhya\u0026hellip;) were presented to their credulous forefathers as ‘the history’ of India; when they know all these and more, what would be their connection to what we consider as our past today?\nPerhaps, they would even end up being ashamed of their past and of their stories about the past: such stories confirm the worst that the world has told about India. Indian culture and her ‘religions’ were created to inflict massive injustice on fellow-human beings. ‘Hinduism’ would, of course, be the main culprit.\nWe are almost past the first phase. The ideologues of the Sangh Parivar are initiating the subsequent phase. Instead of asking questions about the nature of ‘historical truth’; instead of studying the religious culture where such questions originate from; instead, that is, of understanding the relationship between stories about the past and human communities, the ideologues of the Sangh Parivar want to establish the ‘historicity’ of our epics and stories. In the process of pushing this Christian theme, these ideologues will also achieve what Islam and Christianity have always desired: destruction of the ‘pagan’ and ‘heathen’ culture that India is. What the Muslim kings and the Evangelical Protestants could not achieve over centuries, the ideologues from the Sangh Parivar will achieve in a matter of decades.\nIn order to destroy the past of a people, all you need to do is to give them history. What is called ‘history’ today is a secularization of the Christian religion. Christianity (Islam, Judaism) is hostile to anything that is different from itself. Especially, what it considers Pagan and heathen. This hostility persists in its secularized form as well. The ideologues of the Sangh Parivar, in their haste to capture political power, in their utter and total ignorance of the western culture, are pushing a Christian religious theme on to the Indian culture. Where explicitly Christian and Islamic attacks on the heathen culture of India failed, there, if left unopposed, this disguised attack on India will succeed. The saddest thing of it all is this: the Sangh Parivar genuinely believes that it is helping the Indian culture. However, its ideologues are not; they are helping destroy the Indian culture.\nSo, it appears, the questions facing us are these: do we need a history that Christianity has written, or do we need to retain our past? What do Indians need?\nThe second part of this essay starts on the page 17 of this paper.\nComments SuchindranathAiyerS — 2015-06-27 21:37:24\nAn interesting exploration.

Therefore, no future!\n","tags":[],"title":"What do Indians Need: A History or the Past--S.N.Balagangadhara","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/what-do-indians-need-a-history-or-the-past-s-n-balagangadhara/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","Indian traditions","religion"],"content":" Before deciding about whether or not Vivekananda was ethnocentric, jingoistic or even plain intolerant, one has to understand what Vivekananda was saying. In doing so, the interpretative \u0026ldquo;principle of charity\u0026rdquo; requires us to render him maximally consistent.\nConsider the title of this thread: \u0026ldquo;All religions are true\u0026rdquo;. Spelling-out Vivekananda\u0026rsquo;s stance regarding this theme presupposes the ability to provide convincing answers to questions about what Vivekananda thought \u0026ldquo;religion\u0026rdquo; was, what \u0026ldquo;truth\u0026rdquo; was, and how the latter relates to the former.\nLet me focus on the citation: \u0026ldquo;Ours is the true religion because, above all, it\u0026hellip; stands up\u0026hellip; to tell and to declare to the nations who are mere children of yesterday in comparison with us Hindus - who own the hoary antiquity of the wisdom, discovered by our ancestors here in India.\u0026rdquo;\nTwo things are striking in this citation: the \u0026ldquo;truth\u0026rdquo; of a religion is directly linked to its \u0026ldquo;antiquity\u0026rdquo; and to its \u0026ldquo;wisdom\u0026rdquo;.\nWhat is \u0026ldquo;religion\u0026rdquo; to Vivekananda here? Clearly, not every piece of wisdom is religious because it is wise. (For instance, Polonius\u0026rsquo; advice to his son, though wise, would not be seen by Vivekananda as a part of religion. That is, nowhere does he consider Shakespeare as a \u0026ldquo;religious\u0026rdquo; sage.)\nAs Vivekananda sees it, \u0026ldquo;religious wisdom\u0026rdquo; is obviously tied to its antiquity. The issue is: what has antiquity to do with either \u0026ldquo;religious wisdom\u0026rdquo; or its \u0026ldquo;truth\u0026rdquo;? When it comes to knowledge, antiquity is no guarantee for its truth: we do not say that Plato found the \u0026ldquo;truth\u0026rdquo; because he wrote 2000 years ago, do we? (I presume that Vivekananda also knew this.) Galileo\u0026rsquo;s theory is not \u0026ldquo;true\u0026rdquo; because he came centuries before Einstein. In other words, Vivekananda turns our normal stance with respect to knowledge and wisdom completely around, when he talks about religion: other nations are children compared to the Hindus, he says, and this matters to the issue at hand. The antiquity somehow testifies to \u0026ldquo;religious\u0026rdquo; truth. Question: what was Vivekananda\u0026rsquo;s notion regarding \u0026ldquo;truth\u0026rdquo; here?\nJust as an example, consider his approving citation of Narada in Volume 3 regarding Bhakti: \u0026ldquo;Bhakti is greater than karma, greater than Yoga, because these are intended for an object in view, while Bhakti is its own fruition, its own means and its own end.\u0026rdquo; This means that claiming that \u0026ldquo;all religions are true\u0026rdquo; does not entail the claim that \u0026ldquo;all religions are equal\u0026rdquo;. Some are obviously better (or more superior) than others. The history of the Indian traditions provides ample evidence for this stance. Consequently, it follows that, in the context of the Indian traditions and culture, the claim \u0026ldquo;all religions are true\u0026rdquo; cannot possibly mean what my respected colleagues think it ought to mean, viz., all religions are equal. This observation merely reinforces the suggestion that the link between \u0026ldquo;religion\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;truth\u0026rdquo; (as the Indian traditions see both) is not quite the same as our twenty-first century interpretations.\nConsequently, it appears that the onus of proof lies on my respected colleagues to show either that (a) all Indian traditions are \u0026ldquo;ethnocentrically jingoistic\u0026rdquo; or (b) that Vivekananda was that or (c) both. Citations from Vivekananda do not settle the issue one way or another. What are at stake are our interpretations. May I look forward to illuminating (and non ad hoc) arguments about (i) what Vivekananda\u0026rsquo;s notion of \u0026ldquo;religion\u0026rdquo; was; (ii) what his notion of \u0026ldquo;truth\u0026rdquo; was; (iii) how the claim that \u0026ldquo;all religions are true\u0026rdquo; entails the claim that some \u0026ldquo;religion\u0026rdquo; cannot be better than the other?\n","tags":[],"title":"Principle of Charity","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/principle-of-charity/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","Christianity","religion"],"content":"When a religion claims that it is the word of God and that the word is unconditionally true; and that, further, the word is about the Cosmos: everything that was, is and shall be. So, when I say that religion is such an entity, namely, it claims that it is the word of God and that it claims to be unconditionally true and that it is about the Cosmos, I am accepting the self description of religion. (However, the hypothesis that religion is an EI account formulates it without committing itself to any ontological claims. That is, it takes no stances about what specific religions say or do not say about the existence of entities. The hypothesis does not show how, and in what sense, the Bible, say, is an EI account. It merely says that The Bible has such a status to believers. If you reread the relevant paragraphs of \u0026lsquo;The Heathen\u0026hellip;\u0026rsquo; where I first formulate the hypothesis, you will notice that I formulate it conditionally: \u0026ldquo;If such a being exists, if such an account is forthcoming \u0026hellip; etc then we have an EI account.\u0026rdquo;) If we do not accept the self-description of religion, The Bible becomes a mere book and we cannot study it at all to say anything about Christianity.\nHowever, this meta-characterization is not interesting in and of itself. You see, religion as the EI account of the Cosmos and itself could come into being without having most of the properties that the empirical religions in human societies possess. (See the Sci-Fi example in Chapter 9.) So, when I do talk about religions, I speak of what happens when people believe that they have a religion and the empirical constraints such people put on religion. The dynamic of universalization of religion comes into existence because of the logic of how people go-about in the world: they have a religion and that it is an exemplification of religion. The cultural history of the West can be written because of the internal tension within Christianity: it is both religion and merely one religion in human community.\nReligions, if studied either as Religion or as World view, force us to do theology. But religion also generates a configuration of learning and I study religion at this level of abstraction. Here, I do not have to accept the self-description of religion but merely describe the dynamic of the emergence of a configuration of learning. The latter is brought into existence by human beings who relate to each other and the world in a particular way. So, I accept the existence of a configuration of learning; I believe that it is possible to develop hypotheses about it that satisfy the best criteria of rationality and scientificity that we possess. I do not have to assume the existence of religion: I say that people act as though what they have is religion; one can say that they are rational beings because the existence of religion is a good reason for them to believe in the existence of religion; they believe in its existence; this attitude makes them go-about in the world in a particular way (i.e. this is their configuration of learning); and this way of going-about in the world has a structure and logic that can be described; such descriptions can be tested in a rational way\u0026hellip; In other words, religion can be studied at three different levels of abstraction: (a) religion as religion - this is the level of self-description of religion; (b) religion as also a world view - this also forces us to do some kind of theology; (c) apart from being religion and world view, a religion also produces a configuration of learning. My studies are pitched at the level of (c) and does not touch either (a) or (b).\n","tags":[],"title":"Religion ‘sui generis’?","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/religion-sui-generis/"},{"categories":["Christianity","Indian traditions","Jakob","secularization"],"content":" When we consider Paul Hacker\u0026rsquo;s story on \u0026lsquo;inclusivism as a typically Indian thought form\u0026rsquo;, all we can conclude is that he has used a typically Christian thought form to understand an aspect of the Indian cultural traditions, which he is unable to understand because it is completely different from what he knows. Hacker\u0026rsquo;s inclusivism is merely an attempt to strip the following Christian account from its recognizably Christian characteristics: \u0026ldquo;When God created man he inscribed him with a sense of divinity, and when it is not corrupted this sense is the true religion. Throughout human history the devil and his minions corrupted this sense of divinity into false religion or worship of the devil among all human peoples. Until the good Lord brought mankind back to the true religion by revealing himself in Jesus Christ. Thus, Christianity is the one true religion. It is the message of self-disclosure in which God reveals his Will for the universe to the humankind. Of course, all other traditions contain traces of divine revelation, but these are nothing but the preparation of the Gospel. Once the true religion was revealed again, all non-Christian traditions could be nothing but pale and erring variants of Christianity.\u0026rdquo; Now Hacker has merely taken this Christian conceptual scheme to make sense of the attitude the Indian traditions take towards other traditions. Although it happens unconsciously most of the time, this is the basic method of Indology: one looks at the Indian traditions, and the only way to make sense of them is to make them fit into a conceptual framework of secularized Christian theology.\nThe previous Christian account shows how far Christianity can go in allowing truth to other cultural traditions. They contain traces of divine revelation, but these are hidden in a corrupted and convoluted pattern of idolatry. Christianity cannot go any further, precisely because it is a religion. As a religion, it claims to be the revelation of God\u0026rsquo;s will. As God\u0026rsquo;s will governs the universe, there can only be one God with one will. And as there can be only one doctrine that fully conveys God\u0026rsquo;s will to humankind, there can only be one true religion. All other traditions have to be either heresy (false worship of the true God) or idolatry (worship of the false god). Now, it is only within such a theological framework, which Christianity shares with Islam and Judaism, that the question about the truth of religions becomes of supreme importance.\nWhen we compare this to the non-religious or non-semitic pagan traditions, it is obvious that they take a completely different attitude towards other traditions. They do not think one traditions is the one true revelation of the one true God. Rather, they see all of these as essentially human traditions which are part of a search for truth (or knowledge or enlightenment). From the Roman Religio to Tibetan Buddhism to Kashmiri Shaivism, these traditions consider themselves and other traditions as a set of ancestral practices which makes a certain community into a community. They are considered to be different paths toward the same goal (as Gandhi put it), or different practical systems in a search for truth (as Q.A. Symmachus put it). Here, the question of true and false religion does not arise, since truth and falsity cannot be ascribed to different sets of ancestral practices. It would be a category mistake to do so. That is, the question \u0026lsquo;Is Tibetan Buddhism or Roman Religio or Kashmiri Shaivism true?\u0026rsquo; does make as much sense as the question \u0026lsquo;Do green ideas sleep furiously\u0026rsquo;?\nThe problem is that we are today living in an intellectual world that is colonized by the theoretical framework of secularized Christian theology, as Indologists like Prof. Hacker show. We have learned to look at the Indian traditions as though they are religions which can be true or false. In fact, we have learned to think of these traditions as pale and erring variants of the Christian religion. Unfortunately, this \u0026lsquo;we\u0026rsquo; includes the Indian intellectuals. They also conceptualize their traditions as religions or doctrinal systems, while they are really practical systems. As different people on this thread point out, the resulting confusion surfaces in the writings of thinkers like Gandhi and Vivekananda. On the one hand, these thinkers repeat the typically pagan stories about other traditions: \u0026lsquo;All traditions are paths to the same goal.\u0026rsquo; On the other hand, they have learned to think and talk in the Christian terminology, and they say that \u0026lsquo;all religions are true\u0026rsquo;.\nSome more complexity is added, because it is very difficult if not impossible for pagans to understand the Christian claim to be the true religion. How can these Christians think that their account about Jesus Christ being God\u0026rsquo;s revelation is the true doctrine or religion? How can they expect all other human traditions to adopt this doctrine? Of course, these pagan traditions admit, the story about Jesus Christ is impressive and he must certainly have been a good man, but why should we dispose of all our stories and practices and accept the Christian account, just because they think they are right and we are wrong. This attitude toward the truth claims of Christianity also explains why thinkers like Gandhi and Vivekanandan often expressed their displeasure with the Christian religion and its missionary zeal. They thought Christianity was inferior precisely because it could not allow other traditions as valid paths toward enlightenment.\nHere we can come to Akbar\u0026rsquo;s din-i-ilahi. As he emerged from the Islamic tradition but was imbibed with the attitudes of the Indian traditions, a strange mixture came into being in Akbar\u0026rsquo;s thought (not that strange: similar attitudes can be found in contemporary Indian Islam and Indian Christianity). On the one hand, he thought that all human traditions were religions - including the ancestral practices of the pagan traditions. Therefore, he must also to some extent have thought that Islam was the true religion, i.e., the one full revelation of the one true God. On the other hand, however, he had adopted the Indian attitude that sees different traditions as different paths toward the same goal. Therefore, he wanted to include all of these paths in the true religion. The result is his project to create a universal religion that included all traditions as the revelation of Allah. Thus, din-i-ilahi was born.\n","tags":["exclusivism","exklusivismus","inclusivism","Inklusivismus","Paul Hacker"],"title":"Secularized Christian theme: Hacker’s inclusivism and exclusivm","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/secularized-christian-theme-hackers-inclusivism-and-exclusivm/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","basics","language"],"content":"Opening a dictionary to find out the meaning of an English word might indeed be an elementary student\u0026rsquo;s choice, but, if used as a methodology for settling scientific and philosophical discussions, I am afraid, it is a rather poor choice.

In the case of the propositions you have formulated, I assume that \u0026lsquo;God\u0026rsquo; is Vishnu (or even Krishna) and not, say, Shiva or Brahma because you are talking about the Madhvas. However, to keep the discussion faithful to your formulations, I will use the word \u0026lsquo;God\u0026rsquo; to refer to Vishnu.\nYour proposition 1: \u0026ldquo;Creation is a spontaneous activity of God, just like a blissful person spontaneously breaks into a song without any rhyme or reason.\u0026rdquo;\nApparently, this is answering the specific question \u0026lsquo;why\u0026rsquo; (in the sense of \u0026lsquo;KaaraNa\u0026rsquo;, mostly translated as \u0026rsquo;the reason why\u0026rsquo;) God created (the Universe?). The analogy to a blissful person is a very strict one. That is, in exactly the same way a blissful person does not break into a song for a reason, God does not create for a reason. The underlying thoughts are these: normally, one sings a song to express some emotion or the other or even because he/she is feeling some motion or another (love, sorrow, devotion, or whatever else), that is, the person \u0026ldquo;intends\u0026rdquo; to express something. The blissful person does not need to express anything; he/she is not in need of anything, including the need to express the bliss. That is what bliss (ananda) is all about.\nSo, the assumption is that \u0026lsquo;bliss\u0026rsquo;, something we human beings experience, is what God also feels. The only difference is that God feels this all the time, whereas only some of us can (either occasionally or after some tremendous effort) feel that bliss. (Additional claims that God\u0026rsquo;s Bliss is our bliss raised to \u0026ldquo;the power of infinity\u0026rdquo; and such like tell us the same thing: there is no difference in kind but, at best, a difference in degree, between God\u0026rsquo;s emotion and ours.)\nIn other words, the analogy explicates the nature of spontaneity (and the meaning of that word), whether it is God\u0026rsquo;s spontaneity or human spontaneity: doing something not because one is in need of (or lacks) something. There is no difference in kind between us human beings and God but only one of degree. Your next proposition elaborates on this.\nYour proposition 2: \u0026ldquo;The creation of the world does not serve any purpose of God. He is \u0026ldquo;AptakAma\u0026rdquo; - there is nothing he does not have nor is there anything he will ever need.\u0026rdquo; (The \u0026lsquo;he\u0026rsquo; here must also be read strictly: Vishnu is sexed and he is a \u0026lsquo;male\u0026rsquo;.)\nThis further tells us that creation (of something by human beings) serves some purpose or another. Consequently, one might be inclined to say that God is \u0026ldquo;in need\u0026rdquo; of something that he does not have, and hence the creation. This proposition tells us that God has \u0026ldquo;everything\u0026rdquo;: he is more beautiful than the most beautiful; stronger than the strongest; richer than the richest; the teacher of teachers; braver than the bravest, etc. Again, these are all differences in degree: he has more of everything we \u0026ldquo;desire\u0026rdquo;, he is \u0026ldquo;more\u0026rdquo; than any of us or other \u0026lsquo;gods\u0026rsquo;; and so on. He really does not need anything; he is bliss personified. Therefore, creation should not be seen as making up for some or another lack in God. In this sense, creation does not serve any purpose: one should say that God has \u0026ldquo;no purpose\u0026rdquo; in creating. He just creates. In other words, there is no intention behind God\u0026rsquo;s creation. Spontaneity is the absence of intention or purpose of any sort, and the analogy drawn in the first proposition shows that action without intention is typical of a blissful person. Because God is bliss personified, God\u0026rsquo;s creation does not exhibit his purpose or express his intention. (Should it do so, then God needs to express his purpose, which makes God into someone \u0026ldquo;in need\u0026rdquo; of such an expression.) Hence the notion of creation as God\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;lila\u0026rdquo;. That is to say, creation is completely without purpose. To use a modern terminology, to speak of the universe as an expression of God\u0026rsquo;s intention or God\u0026rsquo;s purpose is to commit a category mistake.\nYour proposition 3: \u0026ldquo;The \u0026lsquo;creation\u0026rsquo; of the universe is just the transformation of the prakriti from its \u0026ldquo;avyakta\u0026rdquo; state to \u0026ldquo;vyakta\u0026rdquo; state. All the laws of the universe are an expression of prakriti\u0026rsquo;s innate triguna svabhAva.\u0026rdquo;\nTherefore, God \u0026lsquo;functions\u0026rsquo; as a catalyst (to use this term from high-school Chemistry) in the process of creation. This function enables the \u0026lsquo;potentiality\u0026rsquo; of Prakriti to become \u0026lsquo;actuality\u0026rsquo;. The laws of the universe, consequently, do not express what God \u0026lsquo;desires\u0026rsquo; or God \u0026lsquo;wants\u0026rsquo; but express the \u0026rsquo;nature\u0026rsquo; of prakriti. That is, the universe retains its character of not being the product of God\u0026rsquo;s intention or God\u0026rsquo;s plans or God\u0026rsquo;s purpose. Universe expresses what universe is like, what it always has been and always will be: namely, \u0026ldquo;it is in the nature of the universe to be what it is\u0026rdquo;. God has added nothing to the universe that was not already there, nor has he taken away something that was there earlier. \u0026ldquo;This is the way universe has been, is, and will be, because it belongs to the nature of the universe to be the way it was, is, and will be.\u0026rdquo;\nYour proposition 4: \u0026ldquo;God is at all times impartial and as an antaryami immanent spirit, He is the power behind all the \u0026lsquo;being\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;becoming\u0026rsquo; (ie, expression of their individual svabhAvas) of souls as well as prakriti\u0026rdquo;.\nBecause God is bliss personified, he cannot be attached to anything or anybody. Therefore, he is strictly impartial. He is the \u0026lsquo;power\u0026rsquo; behind everything and is everywhere: both in the individuals and in \u0026rsquo;the universe\u0026rsquo; (using \u0026rsquo;the universe\u0026rsquo; for \u0026lsquo;prakriti\u0026rsquo;). He must be an \u0026lsquo;antaryami\u0026rsquo; (present internally in everything and everywhere) because he would not \u0026ldquo;have everything\u0026rdquo; if he was not. Were he not to be in a gnat or an ant, he would lack something, namely \u0026ldquo;what it feels to be like a gnat or an ant\u0026rdquo;. So, he has to be everywhere.\nNow, we can begin to sense the generic question behind these propositions: If this is what \u0026lsquo;bliss\u0026rsquo; is, that is, not lacking anything, and if this entity is bliss personified and is present in each one of us (and elsewhere too) are \u0026lsquo;we\u0026rsquo; not, in reality, or in our essence, also identical to this entity? Tat Tvam Asi, \u0026rsquo;thou art that\u0026rsquo;: is not this what one of the mahAvAkya tells us? \u0026lsquo;Aham Brhmasmi\u0026quot;, as another of the mahAvAkya also tells us. Does it really matter what you call this \u0026lsquo;blissful entity\u0026rsquo; as? And so on.\nFrom these propositions, if you draw the inference, which you want to, \u0026ldquo;hence, he governs the Universe\u0026rdquo;, you need to understand \u0026lsquo;governing\u0026rsquo; as (a) an impartial act; (b) by the \u0026lsquo;power\u0026rsquo; in the \u0026lsquo;core\u0026rsquo; of each one of us and (c) present in the rest of the Universe. One could also identify oneself with one\u0026rsquo;s \u0026lsquo;core\u0026rsquo;, and hence with the \u0026lsquo;power\u0026rsquo; present in that \u0026lsquo;core\u0026rsquo;, and become an advaitin. Alternately, one could differentiate this \u0026lsquo;power\u0026rsquo; from oneself and postulate \u0026lsquo;another\u0026rsquo; entity: and hence the dvaita traditions.\nIn other words, the generic question behind these propositions brings us to the Indian debates and Indian traditions, which are far, far removed from the Semitic theological debates. The Biblical God is distinct from, and alien to, the creatures He has created; he has plans and purposes in creation; His intention (or will) expresses itself as the laws of the Universe; we cannot know (or ask) why He created the Universe; even when He tells us (through His revelation) why He did what He did, we do not understand it adequately, and so on and so forth.\n","tags":[],"title":"Creation: Spontaneous or Intentional","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/do-indian-traditions-claim-that-the-universe-is-an-expression-of-gods-intention/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","natural sciences","rationality"],"content":"Consider the question: \u0026ldquo;why superstition?\u0026rdquo; Our problem lies in circumscribing this notion itself: is it something we should use to characterize beliefs, or attitudes, or theories or actions or all of them? Our linguistic usage allows it mostly of \u0026lsquo;beliefs\u0026rsquo; and to the act of believing: to believe that walking under the ladder brings bad; to believe that vampires exist and walk as ordinary humans in the night; to believe in the fairy who watches over you, etc. are all instances of superstition. It also allows us to use it in connection to the truth status of theories like, for instance, the claim that it is superstitious to believe in astrology. However, accepting this usage is not enough: what makes a belief a superstitious belief or an act of believing a superstitious act? It is here that many, many problems come to the fore. One easy way out is to use science and scientific theories as the contrast set: any belief that is not countenanced by the scientific theories of today is a superstitious belief. Of course, this is too broad: on this account, every belief that displaces the current scientific beliefs (i.e., the new scientific theories) becomes superstitious. If you try and circumvent this problem by speaking about \u0026lsquo;scientific theories\u0026rsquo; in the abstract (i.e., do not circumscribe them in time), the danger is that every belief (almost) escapes the net. Just because scientific theories of today do not recognize the existence of ghosts, it does not follow, one could argue, that the sciences of tomorrow cannot recognize the role that mediums play in talking to the spirits of the long departed. You can try and say that all beliefs disproved by science should belong to the set of superstitious beliefs: however, similar problems occur. On top of it, you have the difficulty of saying why one should not have superstitious beliefs. And so on.\nYou see, one way out of these sets of problems is to take a dogmatic stance: any and every belief that the scientific theories of today do not countenance is a superstitious belief. Not only is such an attitude dogmatic, it is also stupidly irrational and anti-knowledge. Does science recognize the existence of moral agency, the will, or the bearer of human rights? It does not. So, is one to believe that all claims about them are superstitious? One might want to say that these ideas are cogently argued and philosophically defensible. But, then, so is the doctrine of transubstantiation and the concept of trinity in Christianity. Why is one superstitious and the other not so?\nIs believing in astrology superstitious? Christianity has claimed this ever since its inception. Most arguments against astrology today do not even reach the level St.Augustine\u0026rsquo;s critique of the same.\nYou ask: Why are causal explanations sought and clung to for life? Did you know that this attitude was considered the hallmark of science and rationality for more than four centuries and was thought to be the antipode of superstition? The claim was that primitive people had no conception of \u0026lsquo;causality\u0026rsquo; and, therefore, were superstitious and that the notion of \u0026lsquo;causal explanation\u0026rsquo; is the contribution of science.\nYou ask: Why do they attribute agency to supernatural beings? Who are these \u0026ldquo;super natural\u0026rdquo; beings? If anything, magic does not have a conception of \u0026lsquo;super\u0026rsquo; natural being at all; most people and cultures do not have it either. All their agents are agents-in-nature; among religions, only Christianity, Judaism and Islam speak of the \u0026ldquo;supernatural\u0026rdquo; agent, namely God. To provide an \u0026rsquo;evolutionary explanation\u0026rsquo; of the cognitive-biological tendency to seek \u0026lsquo;supernatural agents\u0026rsquo; everywhere is to ask a pseudo-question and provide a pseudo-answer.\nYou ask: What is the grip of magical thinking? I will not ask you to tell me what magic is; I will assume that we both know that the word, somehow, makes sense to us. However, do you know that magic asks a question that science cannot answer? And that the question is perfectly rational and intelligible? Consider a magical explanation about someone dying unexpectedly after, say, a brief period of disorientation. Let us suppose that science discovers that he had diabetes. Still, the person who believes in magic asks a question that cannot be answered: \u0026ldquo;why should this diabetic die at this moment and on this occasion? There are any number of people like the deceased, who have not died. Why he and now?\u0026rdquo; What is wrong with this question, to which, let us say, there is an answer from someone who does believe in magical thinking? What is silly or irrational about the question? And what is superstitious about giving an answer to this question?\nIn other words, the problem is not an absence of interest in understanding \u0026lsquo;heathendom\u0026rsquo; as you put it. The problem is in knowing how to go about it. Note: for more on how Christianity has the changed the reference and meaning of \u0026lsquo;superstitio\u0026rsquo;, how pagans of Antiquity understood the same, check the second chapter of \u0026lsquo;The Heathen in his blindness: Asia, the West and the dynamic of religion\u0026rsquo;\n","tags":[],"title":"Superstition and rationality","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/superstition-and-rationality/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","experience","ignorance","Indian traditions"],"content":"According to your account, Vedanta claims that the world is an illusion and that only the Brahman is real.\nIf the world is an illusion, Vedanta has to deny the reality of the world. To it, in the way you construe Vedanta, the world is the empty set. That is to say, all experiences are on par because they are all illusions. One cannot distinguish between experiences unless one introduces the notion of a differentiated reality. From this, it follows that a vedantin should not be able to discriminate, say, between the following: the pain you have by stubbing your toe, the pain you have when your arm is cut off without anaesthesia, and the pain you feel when your loved one dies. If he does draw a distinction between them, he is distinguishing one illusion from the other and the only way of doing that is to ascribe to these illusions the status of reality: this is \u0026rsquo;less illusory\u0026rsquo; than… this is \u0026lsquo;more real\u0026rsquo; than… this \u0026lsquo;pains more than\u0026rsquo;… this pain is \u0026lsquo;different from\u0026rsquo;…and so on. If he does not distinguish, and insists there is no difference between falling in a lake and bumping his head against a tree, who would take him seriously? Do you believe that Indians are such cretins that they would simply accept such inane stories? Surely, if \u0026lsquo;Brahman\u0026rsquo; is all there is to Vedanta, all vedantins must be perfect imbeciles. In that case, we do not need heavy-duty tantric stuff to shoot them down; a simple dose of commonsense will do.\nShankara was a vedantin, as you know. If you had glanced at his writings, say his Mayapanchakam for example, you would have known that what you say does not make sense. In this poem, he describes the power of maya and ascribes agency to \u0026lsquo;her\u0026rsquo;. He speaks about those whom she spellbinds: they are a plurality of creatures including the learned, the human, the animal, and, of course, the Brahman. How could he talk about the \u0026lsquo;power\u0026rsquo; of maya, her incredible abilities to control creatures, if both maya and the plurality of these creatures and their experiences were not real? Maya makes sense only if the world and its richness are real. Maya does not imply the absence of the experiential world but presupposes its reality instead. To say that maya is the nature of reality makes sense. It is, however, linguistic nonsense to say that illusion is the nature of reality. How could the vedantins discuss with each other if they spouted semantic nonsense?\nIt is obvious where the problem is to be partially located. You translate \u0026lsquo;maya\u0026rsquo; as \u0026lsquo;illusion\u0026rsquo;. This translation does not work, when you are talking about one of the central categories that many Indian traditions use. To understand why it could not be a translation of maya, consider the following argument. After all, Vedanta claims that when one realises the unity of \u0026ldquo;oneself\u0026rdquo; and the \u0026ldquo;Brahman\u0026rdquo;, one achieves enlightenment. If \u0026rsquo;everyone\u0026rsquo;, except the enlightened, is under the sway of \u0026lsquo;illusion\u0026rsquo;, what causes it? Vedanta claims there are causes. If there are causes, they cannot be \u0026lsquo;illusionary\u0026rsquo; entities. If causes are real, so are their effects. \u0026lsquo;Illusion\u0026rsquo; is an effect. Therefore, \u0026lsquo;illusion\u0026rsquo; is also \u0026lsquo;real\u0026rsquo;. In that case, Vedanta would become flatly nonsensical. Whatever else Vedanta is, it is not semantic nonsense. Surely, one should understand what Vedanta denies and what it does not, before indulging in silly contrasts.\n","tags":[],"title":"Is Maya an Illusion?

Now to say \u0026ldquo;I made 50 runs\u0026rdquo; is to assume that, Mr. X who made 1 run, 2 run, etc. is linked to each other, and this organism , in this sense, has a unity. This unity is what Balu calls rubbish\u0026rdquo;. First, I do not call this \u0026lsquo;unity\u0026rsquo; rubbish. Second, this is a problem not pertaining to \u0026rsquo;the self\u0026rsquo; but one applicable to any object or entity that persists over time. Because we can speak about the spatial and temporal career of an object (whether it involves disassembling and then reassembling a watch or whether it is about a merger of two corporations or firms or about our bodies or whatever), the logical problem of identity crops up: what makes some object, any object, the same object at different spatial and temporal intervals? I.e. how can the organism (currently called \u0026lsquo;Balu\u0026rsquo;, say) be the same organism when, as it spatially and temporally moves in the world, it accrues different properties? After all, \u0026lsquo;Balu\u0026rsquo; at some spatio-temporal point (say when the organism is 5 years old) has properties different from \u0026lsquo;Balu\u0026rsquo; at some other spatio-temporal interval. Because these two spatio-temporal units do not have identical properties, they have to be different objects. Yet, we say \u0026lsquo;here is Balu\u0026rsquo;s photo when he was 5 years old\u0026rsquo;. The problem of logical identity crops up in such contexts. As I say, this is a problem that confronts any theory of identity (as a logical relationship). Philosophy of logic has provided a few solutions to this question even if they all face problems.\n2. We carry this problem over into discussions about \u0026lsquo;psychological identity\u0026rsquo;. It is unclear what this notion refers to; it seems to pick out different things to different people. Let me pose the issue negatively: why would we want to call someone who thinks he is \u0026lsquo;Hitler\u0026rsquo; at one moment, \u0026lsquo;Stalin\u0026rsquo; an hour later, \u0026lsquo;Freud\u0026rsquo; half an hour later, \u0026lsquo;Alexander the Great\u0026rsquo; after 10 minutes of being Freud\u0026hellip;.etc as crazy? Why, on the other hand, do we sagely nod, when people tell us that every one of us has multiple identities like, say, being scholar, a husband, a father, a teacher, a political activist, a poet, an avid Rafi fan\u0026hellip; etc? What makes the first person a lunatic and the second person \u0026rsquo;normal\u0026rsquo;? The theory of \u0026lsquo;psychological identity\u0026rsquo; tries to answer this question. To some extent, even this issue is not called \u0026lsquo;rubbish\u0026rsquo; by me.\nThis problem too is carried over: into the realm of law, ethics and society. For certain purposes, we need to assume that the issue of \u0026lsquo;identity\u0026rsquo; is not problematic. If it were, we could not even pay wages (the \u0026lsquo;Balu\u0026rsquo; who worked yesterday is not identical to the \u0026lsquo;Balu\u0026rsquo; of today because they have different properties. Therefore, I refuse to pay wages to \u0026rsquo;this\u0026rsquo; Balu.), nor prosecute someone for a crime, nor identify culpability and so on. Our social life will ground to a halt in the absence of some kind of implicit convention about the social, psychological identity of a person. Even this is not called \u0026lsquo;rubbish\u0026rsquo; by me.\nThen there are those who call our \u0026lsquo;self representations\u0026rsquo; (our images about ourselves) as a part of psychological identity. I think this is rubbish. Not the whole of the set of self-representations (like \u0026lsquo;Balu\u0026rsquo; names an organism that is biological in nature, a member of a species,\u0026hellip; etc) are false but only some parts which appear to define our \u0026lsquo;uniqueness\u0026rsquo; to ourselves. I am still thinking about this problem and what thinking I have done suggests to me that our \u0026lsquo;self representation\u0026rsquo; (used narrowly to represent our individual uniqueness to ourselves) stands in the way of \u0026lsquo;knowing ourselves\u0026rsquo;.\n5. Further, there is also the problem of \u0026lsquo;Self\u0026rsquo; (atman): what is this entity, how do we recognize it, does it exist or not, what is its relation to a body, and so on and so forth. There is not much for me to say about this partly because I do not have a grasp of either the conceptual apparatus or the experiential knowledge behind it. If and when I succeed in representing the Indian traditions in the twenty-first century language, I could also tell you what it is. But not now. For the moment, in my personal life, the adhyatmic tradition which advices me to pursue this line of enquiry helps me. I am not willing to call it rubbish at all.\nAnd there is the fact that the Christian concept of \u0026lsquo;soul\u0026rsquo; has more or less been translated as our \u0026lsquo;individual personalities\u0026rsquo;. What to do with this when there are disciplines which claim to study this scientifically? (Developmental psychology, clinical psychology, personality psychology, etc.) There is also the fact that this soul is the basic notion of \u0026lsquo;agency\u0026rsquo; in law, ethics, micro-economics, rational and social choice theories, etc. In other words, there is not one problem about the \u0026lsquo;self\u0026rsquo; but a bewildering variety instead. Please keep these and other sundry themes in mind while talking about \u0026rsquo;the self\u0026rsquo;.\n","tags":[],"title":"What is rubbish about the ‘self’ and what not?","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/what-is-rubbish-about-the-self-and-what-not/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","knowledge","social sciences"],"content":"Paraphrasing Feynman: \u0026ldquo;the answers proposed like counting angels that can dance on the head of a pin are trivial.\u0026rdquo;\nI am not in the least impressed by (in fact, I am disgusted by and contemptuous about) the attitude of the likes of Feynman. Here is one reason why: I too have a criticism of (some) social sciences and (some) aspects of the western philosophy. I too consider that some of these social sciences are not sciences in any sense of the term. But that is because I believe that some of these disciplines endlessly embroider theology and I feel that my research might go someway in setting the situation straight. In other words, as far as I am concerned, the current state of social science is a problem which requires to be addressed seriously. The reason for the seriousness must be obvious: we need to urgently understand the nature of human beings in all its facets, if we have to survive as a species. Making fun of philosophy and social sciences is one thing; to do something about it is entirely different.\nI am not interested in defending either the social sciences or western philosophy in its current form. But I am concerned about the fact that we seem to know so little about ourselves. However, the mistakes that social sciences and philosophy commit in their quest for knowledge about human beings are extremely valuable lessons for me: if it was not for these mistakes, my own research would not be so productive and I would probably be making the same mistakes myself. I am thankful for every mistake, to narrow down the focus, the British Orientalists committed; I look at those individuals with gratitude and affection. If it was not for this legacy of mistakes, there would have been no research programme to develop. In the true sense of the word, I am standing on the shoulders of giants. That is why I can see farther than they could. As I say, this is not merely my psychological attitude; it is also a heuristic that guides my research programme.\nAbout angels on a pin head. Funnily enough, this is a very serious question that involves the Christian understanding of human beings, salvation, heaven and hell, and also the theories of psychological identity. The issue is about angels: are they purely spiritual beings (in that case how could one say they exist because existence seems to require materiality) or do they merely have tiny bodies? If tiny, how tiny is it? Could all the angels in Heaven be accommodated on a pin head?\nWhat has this to do with human beings? Well, the answer is obvious: what happens to human beings till the day of judgement? How could you be punished in Hell without having your body? What exactly is resurrected during God\u0026rsquo;s reign on earth? How big is hell (does it have a physical location and is it a physical space) that it can provide space to all the sinners? Are heaven and hell mere metaphors or are they also real places? Etc\nWhat has this to do with psychological identity? Again, the answer must be obvious. How can you say that some person is sent to hell or heaven, if it is the case he does not have his body? After all, having a specific body is essential to being the person you are. So, if committing sins sends you to hell, you must go there with your body. And so on.\nThe Feynmanian contempt for this question becomes all the more grating: his implicit and explicit understanding of himself and other human beings is completely indebted to these kinds of debates and their answers. Not only that. Even his contempt is derived from the same source: the Protestant critiques of medieval scholasticism. The Protestants criticised scholasticism because Catholicism had become a heathen religion to them, and all these \u0026lsquo;human\u0026rsquo; contributions merely corrupted the true religion. That Feynman does not know his own culture is excusable; but, is that a reason for us to reproduce Protestant critiques of Catholic Christianity as the last word on the status of human sciences?\n","tags":[],"title":"Does Feynman know about his culture?","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/does-feynman-know-about-his-culture/"},{"categories":["adhoc","Balagangadhara","puja","tradition"],"content":" When we provide explanations, we should also look at their contrastive nature: why do puja to cows and not to buffalos? The problem in this case, however, is this: the explanation one gives about a tradition (you will soon see that one of the problems is to identify the explanandum itself) must also incorporate this contrast. Someone like Kanch Ilaiah has answered this question thus: the puja to cows and not to the buffalos expresses racism (that is at the origin of the caste system) because cows are white and buffaloes are always dark. In other words, you cannot simply ask for a contrastive explanation without incorporating it in a \u0026lsquo;bigger\u0026rsquo; explanation that explains the explanandum.\nNow the problem is this. What should we explain: the possible origin of a tradition, or its continuation and reproduction, or both? Ideally, we might want to do both; currently, we cannot do either. Here, there are two kinds of issues: one is that we do not know what kind of explanation we should seek: should we provide \u0026lsquo;good reasons\u0026rsquo; (and make unclear assumptions about human rationality and the relation between reasons and actions) or should we look for some or another kind of causal explanation (and make unclear assumptions about the causal impact the world has on human beings and the nature of the beings we are) or some or another kind of plausible explanation (and make unclear assumptions about what \u0026lsquo;plausibility\u0026rsquo; is, and the relation between that human reasoning and actions). The second issue is this: it is not at all obvious (unless the explanation explains the how and the what) whether the origin of a tradition and its continuation can both be explained by the same explanans. Assume, for instance, that one \u0026rsquo;explains\u0026rsquo; the origin of the puja to cows by looking at the ecological context of some community or another. However, the persistence of that practice cannot anymore be explained by this explanans, when members from that community migrate elsewhere (say, to a city) and the subsequent generations continue the same practice. When one claims that a tradition is not in need of an explanation, refer to this aspect of \u0026rsquo;explaining\u0026rsquo; the continuation of a tradition.\nOf course, these meta-theoretical problems cannot be adequately tackled unless one provides an explanation of, say, doing puja to cows. We have any number of ad hoc explanations of this isolated fact (from the \u0026lsquo;fact\u0026rsquo; that we see cows as our mothers through their \u0026lsquo;religious\u0026rsquo; significance to racism), but they are really no good as far as explanations go. What we need is a hypothesis, which is capable of tackling several different kinds of problems but one which also solves the problem of doing puja to cows. Only then can we have a satisfactory discussion of the issues involved without having futile polemics.\nYou suggest we need to understand the \u0026ldquo;mind states\u0026rdquo; of the farming community. You are, of course, right in identifying several ways of doing it. But it is not clear to me what your demand is, or what you are presupposing. Are you suggesting that we understand the mind state of every individual in a farming community? If so, I believe that this is an impossible demand. Are you suggesting that we look at the entire community as a single organism and formulate a hypothesis about its mind state as though it obeys the patterns of individual psychologies? If yes, why do we need such a hypothesis? (Let us overlook the other problems involved in such a construction.) And then you further to speak about the intensity and depth of their emotional attachment to farming animals. While you are right that such attachment does exist, how do these emotions explain either the origin or the reproduction of a tradition?\nHaving a reason or rationale for a practice (say like doing puja to cows) merely shows that there is a reason or rationale for some action or another. But, without adding other assumptions, it does not explain (see the point in 2) either the practice or its continuation. In fact, it does not even justify the practice, unless you say that some action is justified if and only if some reason or rationale can be given to justify it.\nFor more on \u0026lsquo;sacred\u0026rsquo; cows, check this: Beef Bans, Beef Parties, and Sacred Cows\nComments bennedose — 2014-11-28 19:14:00\nWould it be possible to say that all worship, that is, the worship of anyone or anything by any human is a form of neurosis in which the person gets some comfort by performing a mental or physical act. In other words, worship itself is like double or triple checking that the stove is turned off or that the door is locked before leaving home. The need to worship is a feeling of guilt instilled in infancy and childhood, a type of guilt that can only be assuaged by performing the act.

As a philosopher, I have come to think that one could argue almost any position, within reasonable limits. Mostly, they consist of putting across plausible, or even logically possible considerations in order to show that either some point is plausible or that it could be true. Up to a point, arguments have a function: they force you to reason, check for inconsistencies, train your thinking process, etc. However, you must remember that ultimately all you have done is make a sentence or a set of sentences sound plausible or shown it to be logically consistent and possible. More often than not, it has a psychological purpose as well: that of shooting down some person, demonstrate intelligence, exhibit stupidity and so on. However exhilarating it might be at times, this is a very unproductive occupation, if carried on too far: one does not advance knowledge a great deal.\nThe second too involves reasoning, logic, etc but it tries to build some kind of a theory. Such an activity advances hypotheses, rejects or reformulates them, tries to solve problems and so on. Even where proved wrong, a fruitful hypothesis tells us something about the world.

At least one reason for this failure is Staal’s own meta-theoretical commitments as they are reflected on at least two levels. Firstly, what contemporary philosophy has become: a profession which confuses building theories with providing arguments for making this or that thesis appears plausible or acceptable. Of course, this may not be just a conclusion. It could be the result of holding the no-longer tenable view that scientific explanations are some sort of deductive arguments. Secondly, rather naive notion of what sciences are and thus what human sciences can be: if some phenomenon is not \u0026lsquo;universal’ then a theory about it cannot be set up (e.g. p.63).\u0026rdquo;\n","tags":[],"title":"Arguments vs. theories","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/arguments-vs-theories/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","terrorism"],"content":"What Brig SK Malik says supports my thesisabout terrorism, instead of making it redundant, as one suggests.

(This includes many provisos, including that the war is justified.) That is to say, a theory of just war (and warfare) justifies what is actually an act of murder. This justification is moral in nature and occurs on the presupposition that \u0026lsquo;killing in a war is a good thing\u0026rsquo;. That is why we give medals to supererogatory acts in times of war, like \u0026lsquo;medals for bravery\u0026rsquo; for instance. (There are many people who do not buy this; hence they are pacifists.) Brig SK Mailk\u0026rsquo;s theory of war and warfare justifies \u0026rsquo;terror\u0026rsquo; (basically the domain of crime): it does so by (a) transforming an entire population (the Indians) into the \u0026lsquo;other\u0026rsquo; (\u0026rsquo;the enemy\u0026rsquo;); (b) justifying any and every action against everyone belonging to or supporting this (Indian) community into \u0026rsquo;the enemy\u0026rsquo;; (c) making no distinction between \u0026rsquo;the soldier\u0026rsquo; and \u0026rsquo;the civilian\u0026rsquo; (whereas every theory of warfare makes this distinction, without which the notion of \u0026lsquo;war\u0026rsquo; threatens to become meaningless); and, above all, (d) by presenting it as a theory of \u0026lsquo;war\u0026rsquo;.

If some or another religion is used to defend the attacks in Mumbai, then it depends very much on the kinds of justifications used; the kind of theology in question; the relationship between the belief-states of the perpetrators and their motives; the relationship between their acts and their religious beliefs; and so on. Religious intolerance might or might not lead to conversion, to persecution of those who have \u0026lsquo;other\u0026rsquo; beliefs, to playing the \u0026lsquo;priest\u0026rsquo; and so on.

However, religious intolerance presupposes that there is only one moral community, the community of all human beings. In fact, religious intolerance can exist only if it presupposes that the message of some religion or the other is applicable to all human beings. In the process, it creates a single, undifferentiated moral community. The civic intolerance could express many things too: that one group which believes in the unity of human moral community comes up against a community that preaches differentiated moral communities, leading to a civic intolerance of the latter by the former.\nI do not think that it is possible to go straight from either religious or civic intolerance to attacks like those in Mumbai or 9/11.

It is the first, namely counter-intuitive, because, as I use it, my use of the word does not refer to any theory, or to sets of beliefs, or to what one believes in. Normally, as we use the word in English, \u0026lsquo;ideology\u0026rsquo; has multiple meanings: a false consciousness; accepting a theory known to be false; presenting the interests of a small strata of people as the universal interests of all; subscribing to premises that are either unjustified or not-examined; and so on. My use has no such connotation. It is the second, namely idiosyncratic, because I have not yet developed a hypothesis about ideology that can explain and justify my use of the word.\nCurrently, as I use it, \u0026lsquo;ideology\u0026rsquo; merely means the following: \u0026ldquo;the ability to\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; That is to say, ideology merely \u0026rsquo;enables\u0026rsquo;. Enables to do what? (Or, ability to do what?) The answer to this question depends on what that ideology is about. That is to say, we have to speak about ideology of \u0026lsquo;something\u0026rsquo; whenever we speak about \u0026lsquo;ideology\u0026rsquo;. In so far as I speak about an ideology of crime, I suggest that it is the ability to present crime as morally praiseworthy. This is the ideology of crime.\nTo get a grip on this rather unfamiliar use of the word \u0026lsquo;ideology\u0026rsquo;, I suggest you see ideology in relation to technology: what technology is to natural sciences is what ideology is to social theories. In the process of trying to know the natural world, human \u0026lsquo;ability to\u0026hellip;\u0026rsquo; also grows. Ability to do what? That depends on what that technology is about. That is, it could be technology of microprocessors, technology of oil recuperation, technology of automobile engineering\u0026hellip; Even though we use \u0026rsquo;technology\u0026rsquo; as an independent word, it makes more sense to specify what kind of technology we are talking about. Analogous consideration holds good for \u0026lsquo;ideology\u0026rsquo; as well.\nThe more we try to understand the human world, the more our \u0026lsquo;ability to..\u0026rsquo; grows. Ever since the Second World War, there is an enormous growth in and proliferation of all kinds of \u0026rsquo;theories\u0026rsquo; about human beings. Especially under the onslaught of post-modernism and post-colonialism, there is an increased ability to defend almost anything as \u0026lsquo;moral\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;justifiable\u0026rsquo;: forgery, mimicry, dishonesty, cowardice,\u0026hellip; etc are now seen as an expressions of \u0026lsquo;resistance\u0026rsquo; (something heroic) of the colonized. People like Homi Bhabha and Gayatri Spivak have made it a very lucrative business to tell such stories. Anti-rationality, anti-science, Anti-west, etc have become a part of our intellectual landscape, in no small means thanks to the post-World War theorizing. The ability to present crime as morally praise worthy comes from such theorizing. That is to say, thanks to what has happened in the post-World War theorizing, it is now possible to build an ideology of crime. This is what I am trying to get at. (I hope to begin working on the notion of ideology in the coming year.)\nBecause ideology is merely the \u0026lsquo;ability to\u0026hellip;\u0026rsquo;, justification of the acts require that people appeal to theories: political, social, moral or even to sets of religious beliefs. So, Ideology of crime enables one to present crime as morally praiseworthy irrespective of what beliefs or theories one uses: Islam, Christianity, Marxism, post-colonialism\u0026hellip; You will see, therefore, that ideology is not \u0026lsquo;independent\u0026rsquo; of all these kinds of theories; nor is it \u0026lsquo;prior\u0026rsquo; to them. The emergence of ideologies depend upon the nature and growth of our theorizing about human beings. Whether all possible ideologies also get built depends on other things I have no clear understanding of.\nIn the article, I speak (deliberately) a bit loosely about \u0026rsquo;terrorist acts\u0026rsquo;. Actually, my hypothesis forbids me from speaking in these terms: there are only criminal acts that are re-described as \u0026rsquo;terrorist acts\u0026rsquo;. What we call as the \u0026rsquo;terrorist acts\u0026rsquo; are acts of supererogation, in so far as the terrorist is concerned. For the rest of the world, they are acts of crime. The ideology of crime enables the terrorist to provide two descriptions of one and the same act as though these two descriptions refer to two different acts. My hypothesis suggests that there is only one act, a criminal act, even though the terrorist believes that there are two sets of acts. In this sense, a terrorist (under my hypothesis) is someone who believes that the supererogatory description actually refers to some act he has done, which, he himself, would call criminal, when the same act is described differently. In very simple terms: when the others (belonging to another moral community) perform the same act he himself has performed, he would call it \u0026lsquo;criminal\u0026rsquo;; yet, he is convinced that he has performed a supererogatory deed.\nBecause of the above, I cannot speak of an ideology of terrorism. If I do speak about it, then I am forced to recognize that there is a class of acts called \u0026rsquo;terrorist acts\u0026rsquo; that is different from \u0026lsquo;criminal acts\u0026rsquo;. My hypothesis denies precisely this. Not only that. To accept that there is \u0026lsquo;ideology of terrorism\u0026rsquo; is to accept the self-description of the terrorists.\nMore specifically to problems regarding the first two paragraphs of \u0026ldquo;presuppositions and implications\u0026rdquo;. The first paragraph says what happens; the second paragraph elaborates on the first and suggests that it is logically impossible. That is to say, the first paragraph (logically speaking) cannot occur in the world but yet it does. The solution for this problem lies in the fact that the terrorist splits the \u0026lsquo;moral community\u0026rsquo; into the \u0026lsquo;us\u0026rsquo; and the \u0026rsquo;they\u0026rsquo; in a particular way. In other words: the whole scenario is not logically possible; yet it occurs because of the kind of split that comes up between the moral community the terrorist momentarily attaches himself to and the \u0026lsquo;others\u0026rsquo;.\nI know that the essay leaves many questions unanswered. It is my hope to answer some of them in the course of my research. My only advice is: do not allow your sense about the meaning of \u0026lsquo;ideology\u0026rsquo; guide reading this essay. I am using it in a technical sense, by endowing it with a very narrow meaning.\n","tags":[],"title":"Ideology of Crime","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/ideology-of-crime/"},{"categories":["immoral","morality","normative","supererogation","terrorism"],"content":"Increasingly, the phenomenon of terrorism has begun to occupy the media, politics, and the lives of people in different parts of the world. The more the attention, however, the less the clarity: what kind of a phenomenon is terrorism? What generates it, what sustains it, and what allows it to expand on an ever-increasing scale?\nThis lack of clarity has to do with the fact that our ideas about terrorism appear as an incoherent set. First, terrorism horrifies most of us; the acts of terrorists are seen as monstrous in scope and size. But the number of deaths or the human suffering, even if we look at an event as momentous as 9/11, is dwarfed by what traffic accidents and smoking do in any given year.\nSecond, despite its relatively small impact (relative, that is, to the impact of smoking, traffic accidents, etc.) and the lower probability of its occurrence (compared again to such phenomena), terrorism induces massive changes in our societies that are incommensurate with the act itself.\nThird, most of us think that terrorists are monsters, lunatics, crazy and evil: they appear as pathological human beings. At the same time, we read in the newspapers that the terrorists not only increasingly draw recruits from the ordinary population, but also that they use ethical considerations like the perceived injustice in the world or attacks on their family, for instance, in their defense. Here, they reason pretty much the same way most of us do.\nFourth, we seem to think that some religion (Islamic fundamentalism) or political doctrine (Marxism) provides the foundation for terrorism. Such political and religious motives are even taken to differentiate it from ordinary crime. Yet, we see terrorism implanting itself in any and every kind of soil: Zionism, deep ecology, Islam, fascism, animal liberation, ethnic self-determination, Christianity, communism, nationalism,… This suggests that no specific religious or political beliefs are required for it to take root and flourish.\nFifth, the only things we see are the acts of crime that terrorists either plan or actually commit. Yet, it is extremely difficult to call them \u0026lsquo;ordinary criminals\u0026rsquo;, because they seem to do something \u0026lsquo;more\u0026rsquo; than just plan or commit criminal acts: they appear more monstrous than thieves or serial killers and the impact of their acts goes far beyond that of other crimes. In short, we entertain what appear as prima facie inconsistent ideas about terrorism.\nA hypothesis about terrorism must provide a solution to the above problems without discounting any of them. We propose that terrorism is a unitary phenomenon (despite internal differentiations) and formulate a single hypothesis that illumines these and other known facts about terrorism. Hopefully, the essay thereby functions as an incentive and a heuristic to develop a better hypothesis.\nWe would like to suggest that terrorism is a particular form taken by crime. In that case, the puzzle is why and how crime takes the form of terrorism. Attempts to characterize terrorism as \u0026ldquo;(violent) acts that intend to terrorize people for socio-political ends\u0026rdquo; do not answer this question. They do point out some of its features. However, there are many violent acts that intentionally instill fear in a population and that also have socio-political ends, but which could hardly be terrorism. The difference between murder (even if it is mass murder) and an act of terrorism that also murders (think of 9/11 in this context), we suggest, does not lie in the motives of the actor, the action, the means used, the nature of the victims, the intended goals or its realized effects. Instead, it is located in how the crime is transformed into \u0026ldquo;something else.\u0026rdquo; What makes crime into terrorism is this act of transformation.\nActually, the act goes beyond transformation: terrorism is trans-substantiated crime. \u0026ldquo;Trans-substantiation\u0026rdquo; refers to the miraculous transformation of some particular substance into another one. (During the Mass, for instance, Roman-Catholics believe that bread and wine are transformed into the body and blood of Christ.) This happens in the case of terrorism as well: crime becomes morally praiseworthy. It does not concern so much a particular crime, but rather the transformation of the entire domain of crime. This trans-substantiation results in the re-presentation of crime as morally praiseworthy. We suggest that what brings about this \u0026ldquo;miracle\u0026rdquo; is an ideology, which we would like to call \u0026ldquo;the ideology of crime.\u0026rdquo; It is our hypothesis that such an ideology exists today and that acts of crime can become acts of terrorism because of what this ideology does and how it does so.\nWe propose to expand on this idea in the following way: first, we explicate what the trans-substantiation consists of; second, we show how this \u0026ldquo;miracle\u0026rdquo; is possible; third, we analyze the presuppositions and implications of such a process; fourth, we dwell on its relation to the self-description of terrorism; finally, we identify some of the illumined facts and spell out the policy implications of our hypothesis.\nThe ideology of crime\nWhile terrorism is not itself an ideology, it exists by virtue of an ideology. By presenting criminal actions as morally praiseworthy, this ideology performs the central function of any ideology: it enables one to lend legitimacy to actions that are otherwise considered illegitimate. The ideology itself does not provide the required justification; if it could, it would be an ethical, political, social or economic theory or even a religion. Instead, the ideology of crime merely enables such a justification, where and when necessary.\nWhat does it mean to say that an act of crime is presented as morally praiseworthy? It means that such an act now has the force of a moral exemplar. But some action can have the force of a moral exemplar to an individual, if and only if that person is a member of a moral community and intends to live as a moral subject. Otherwise it cannot. Therefore, a terrorist to whom a crime becomes a moral exemplar must see himself (and must also be seen by others) as an ethical agent, who is a member of a particular moral community sharing its ideas of good and bad, right and wrong, permitted and forbidden and so on.\nIn so far as an action can have the force of a moral exemplar only to an ethical agent, the ideology of crime makes no further empirical presuppositions about the nature of such an agent. That means to say, the ideology of crime re-describes a criminal act in such a way that such a re-description is indifferent with respect to specific religious and political beliefs that an individual might adhere to. In this sense, it is indifferent to distinctions between cultures, peoples, languages, skin colors, etc. In short, if this ideology of crime has to succeed in presenting some act as a moral exemplar, it has to make the same presuppositions as all our ethical theories. Indeed it does. The ideology of crime is deeply and indissolubly rooted in the ethical domain that all human beings share.\nEven though all human beings share the same ethical domain, we are initiated into this domain through the empirical communities we are born into. These empirical communities are many and differentiated: different religions, cultures, languages, philosophies, traditions, etc. mediate us to the ethical domain and mark our distinctions and differences from each other. In this process, each of us acquires notions of crime as well. Mostly, these are associated with moral infringements, even if, depending upon our differential acquaintance with law, further refinement occurs in the course of our lives. For its success, the ideology of crime not only requires that recruits belong to empirical moral communities, but also that they always remain members of some empirical moral community or the other. That means to say, the ideology of crime (a) presupposes of its recruits that they too have notions of crime that their moral communities have and (b) requires that they continue to retain them as well. Why?\nThe first condition has already been dwelt upon: a morally exemplary action has an ethical force only to a moral subject. As an empirical, moral subject, a person brings with him the notions of right, wrong, good, bad, criminal, legal,\u0026hellip; that prevail in his community. The ideology of crime presupposes this fact. It also requires that the recruit continues to be a member of an empirical moral community because this membership enables an access to the reservoir of human actions. Such a reservoir is continuously replenished with new and original actions, undertaken by human beings in their widely differing circumstances. In having access to such a treasure house, the terrorist ideology has access to novelty as well. That is why new terrorist actions are possible.\nIt is often suggested that terrorists have \u0026ldquo;other\u0026rdquo; moral values than those held by the rest of us. Even though we shall suggest later why this appears to be the case, let us state here where we think this view is profoundly wrong: if the terrorist was not a member of the ethical domain we all share, there would be no terrorism to speak of. The very possibility of terrorism depends upon the fact that the terrorists too make distinctions between good, bad, right, wrong, criminal, legal and so on in exactly the same way we do. That is to say, much like most of us in the world, he too would find some actions (like murder, theft, rape, arson, looting, etc) immoral and criminal the way we do.\nThe evidence is overwhelming that terrorists possess the moral notions we have, and consider the same set of actions which we could call \u0026ldquo;crimes\u0026rdquo; also as crimes. When a terrorist confronts the rape of his mother or sister, or the assassination of his beloved leader; or the fact of his pregnant wife blown to pieces and his child maimed for life by a blast; he too reacts with the same moral judgment and moral emotions his victims have. That is to say, he reacts to these immoral acts as a moral subject: with horror and abhorrence.\nThe terrorist is not a pathological person lacking a moral sense or an alien with utterly strange norms (finding morally good what most of us would find morally abhorrent). He is and has to be similar to us. If he was not, terrorism would not be able to find recruits at all. If there is one thing we have learnt, it is this: the recruiting ground for terrorism is fertile, continually expanding and consists of ordinary people much like us. Unless we assume that the number of pathological people continues to increase because of some evolutionary quirk, which is very improbable, then we have to make sense of how moral subjects very much like us could become terrorists at all. In this sense, and because of this reason, we do not define what \u0026lsquo;crime\u0026rsquo; is, in order to speak about the ideology of crime. The terrorists already possess this notion (furthermore, it does not vary all that much with our day-to-day intuitions). They know what crime is, but the ideology of crime metamorphoses the actions that the terrorists consider as crimes into morally exemplary actions. If this is the case, how does he reconcile his actions with his own moral judgment and emotions? And how does the ideology transform crime into a moral exemplar? We will begin with the second question first.\nThe mechanism of a miracle\nTo answer this question and understand what terrorism is, we must take the hypothesis of the transformation, metamorphosis and trans-substantiation of crime utterly seriously. Because the terrorist is a moral subject too, the ideology of crime can make a criminal act appear ethical to him only if it re-describes and re-presents that act. What kind of change is involved in this process?\nIn the first place, this representation cannot transform a criminal act into an ethical one by making it morally obligatory. If it did, then the terrorist would either be inconsistent (because one and the same act would continue to be both forbidden and obligatory, since the act would both be a crime and moral at the same time), or would not have the notion of crime (because no act would be forbidden), or he would have another set of moral values than the rest of us (our \u0026ldquo;crimes\u0026rdquo; would appear moral to him). We suggest that none of these is the case.\nIn the second place, this transformation must somehow succeed in doubling: it must leave the domain of crime of the terrorist intact and yet re-describe these acts in such a way that they do not appear to belong to the criminal domain. That is, it must appear as though two descriptions of an act actually describe two different acts – the criminal and the ethical.\nIn the third place, such a re-description must place the act beyond both the \u0026ldquo;obligatory\u0026rdquo; and the \u0026ldquo;forbidden,\u0026rdquo; while retaining the distinction between these two sets of actions at the same time. Such must be the transformation that the act appears almost unique (sui generis, one of a kind). This ideology should make his act so unique that the terrorist can neither see nor comprehend it under any other description than the one provided by that ideology. It must trans-substantiate an act, which is neither unique because it belongs to a category of actions, nor moral because it is criminal too in the eyes of the terrorist, into a unique act. That is, the ideology of crime must transform crime by making each criminal action into a unique act, one of a kind. Thereafter, as far as the terrorist is concerned, this act does not have any other description than the one provided by the ideology and he cannot recognize his act under any other description.\nExactly that happens. The ideology trans-substantiates crime into supererogation and, in doing so, meets all the above conditions. \u0026ldquo;Supererogation\u0026rdquo; names the sets of actions that have the force of moral exemplars without being obligatory. Heroism, bravery, kindness, love for one\u0026rsquo;s neighbor, saintly actions, etc. are all examples of supererogation. They are not obligatory, since a failure to perform these actions does not make someone immoral. They have the force of moral exemplars without being obligatory. These actions are \u0026ldquo;over and beyond the call of duty\u0026rdquo; and as such are beyond the realm of moral obligation. That is, they are outside the domain of \u0026ldquo;moral laws,\u0026rdquo; but yet within the ethical domain.\nThe domain of crime and the domain of supererogation share this formal property: they are both \u0026ldquo;beyond the scope of moral laws.\u0026rdquo; In doubling the description of crime, this is what the ideology of crime does: while leaving the description of a criminal act intact, it also provides a re-description of the act as supererogation. This is possible because of the formal property that both crime and supererogation possess. Consequently, these actions appear both sui generis and ethical at the same time. However, because such actions belong to the ethical domain, there is a need for moral justification. The ideology of crime, which, as we have said, makes the action neutral (or indifferent) with respect to religious and political beliefs, allows for any kind of defense: one could appeal to injustice in society or to God\u0026rsquo;s commandments or to oppression and exploitation or to the doctrines of national sovereignty and national interests… The list is both varied and endless. The point to note here is the following: neither religious nor secular doctrines form the intellectual basis of terrorism. They are used in morally justifying an act that has already achieved the status of a supererogatory action. The trans-substantiation of crime into supererogation is not something that these doctrines and beliefs accomplish. The ideology of crime has already done that before either religion or political beliefs are pressed into service. If we fail to see this, we end up conducting sterile and unending debates: such as whether Islam is peace-loving or whether it is antithetical to modern values. These debates are not merely sterile and interminable. They are pernicious as well because, by conducting such debates, we countenance the self-description of terrorism and accept the legitimacy of the transformation of crime into supererogation. To see why this is so, we need to understand the sense in which the ideology of crime is truly subversive.\nPresuppositions and implications\nConsider what the ideology of crime does. It appeals to a moral community, to its ethical and moral notions, and presupposes its distinctions between good and bad, right and wrong, moral and immoral, and so on. On the basis of this distinction, it systematically pulls out immoral acts in order to re-present them as supererogatory to the very same community. The community is asked to judge as \u0026lsquo;moral\u0026rsquo; precisely that act which is immoral and criminal in its eyes. That is to say, the community should consider one and the same act as both immoral and supererogatory at the same time and on the same intellectual and moral grounds. The ideology of crime trans-substantiates some individual into both a moral criminal and a moral saint (at the same time and on the same grounds) to that very community of which he is a part. This is impossible: on one and the same substantive grounds, an act cannot be both immoral and supererogatory at the same time and for the same person. While one could (conceivably) think of two rival moral theories making different ethical pronouncements about some particular act, that is not the case here: a moral community is continually forced to judge actions as criminal and supererogatory at the same time and on the same grounds. Should a moral community ever allow for this to happen, it would disintegrate as a moral community and cease to exist. In that sense, while the ideology of crime undercuts its own foundation, it is also truly subversive: that which turns against and destroys the very community of which it is a part. It necessarily bites the hand that feeds it.\nHow does this situation translate itself in the cognitive world of the terrorist? How does he solve this tension between himself and his moral community? Here is where we see the dynamic nature of the ideology of crime. This ideology allows him to identify differing empirical communities at different times as his \u0026ldquo;relevant\u0026rdquo; moral community of the moment. Consider the Taliban in Afghanistan. At one time, both the US administration and the Pakistani government supported the Taliban fighters militarily, financially and morally. In doing so, both nations became a part of the relevant moral community of the Taliban. However, in the post 9/11 world, neither Pakistan nor the US belongs to the relevant moral community of the Taliban. Instead, they are now its enemies.\nThe internal problem of inconsistency between what the ideology of crime does and the moral foundation on which it rests is transformed into an external opposition between the empirical community that the terrorist momentarily attaches himself to (that community then becomes the \u0026ldquo;relevant\u0026rdquo; moral community for him) and the \u0026ldquo;rest\u0026rdquo; of the world: the opposition between the \u0026ldquo;moral us\u0026rdquo; and the \u0026ldquo;immoral they.\u0026rdquo; The problem does not lie in the \u0026ldquo;us\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;they\u0026rdquo; distinction: all of us make such distinctions, which are based on the real differences that exist between different groups of people. Instead, it has to do with how the distinction is made and what it consists of. The \u0026ldquo;us\u0026rdquo; and the \u0026ldquo;they\u0026rdquo; are ethically hostile forces, each others\u0026rsquo; enemies and two polar opposites locked in struggle, from which only one can emerge as the victor. The internal opposition between a moral community and what the ideology of crime does is expressed as an external battle-to-death between two communities: the \u0026ldquo;moral\u0026rdquo; community that the terrorist momentarily attaches himself to and the \u0026ldquo;others.\u0026rdquo;\nThe identity of these communities is of no cognitive or moral significance in this battle: it could be the Americans today, Iraqis tomorrow and the Pakistanis the day after. Each was an ally at some stage or another; each was thus once a part of the moral community of the terrorist. The ideology of crime has to necessarily turn against its own foundation; the terrorist does the same too by splitting the world into \u0026ldquo;us\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;they\u0026rdquo; in this particular manner.\nThe self-description of terrorism\nConsequently, to say that \u0026ldquo;one man\u0026rsquo;s terrorist is another man\u0026rsquo;s freedom fighter\u0026rdquo; does not entail subscribing to ethical relativism. It is worse than that: it is to endorse the self-description of the terrorist and to underwrite the ideology of crime. The same consideration applies to discussions about whether or not some religion or political theory is a harbinger of terrorism. This also covers the case of those who look at terrorists as \u0026ldquo;lunatics,\u0026rdquo; and as \u0026ldquo;deranged\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;pathological\u0026rdquo; persons. In all these cases, we endorse the description that the ideology of crime provides us with. If there is something tragic about the current intellectual and political scene, it is this: both the friends and foes of terrorism have accepted the self-description of terrorism. We treat the terrorists as \u0026ldquo;exceptional\u0026rdquo; persons, who cannot be understood as \u0026ldquo;normal\u0026rdquo; human beings. We go beyond our ethical and legal limits in our opposition to terrorism and, in doing so, endorse their self-description in that we treat them as more than \u0026ldquo;mere\u0026rdquo; criminals by according them a special status.\nWe allow the subversion of terrorism by subverting our own legal and moral codes, and justify such subversions in the name of national security. We accept the legitimacy of the terrorist argument by endlessly debating the issue of whether or not some religion or political theory encourages terrorism or not. We endorse their self-description by identifying some terrorists as \u0026ldquo;religious\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;fundamentalists,\u0026rdquo; which is exactly what they claim they are. We act as though one \u0026ldquo;ought not to be\u0026rdquo; a fundamentalist forgetting, in the process, that should we give up the fundamental distinction between good and bad, right and wrong, we would only end up all the worse for it. We give up our notions of human rights by making or reinforcing discriminations against people from \u0026ldquo;other\u0026rdquo; religions and regions.\nWe endorse and reproduce the distinction the terrorist makes between the \u0026ldquo;moral us\u0026rdquo; and the \u0026ldquo;immoral they\u0026rdquo; by speaking about the terrorist as though he is not a member of the ethical domain that all human beings share, or as though he has an alien set of \u0026ldquo;moral values\u0026rdquo; when compared to the rest of the human beings. Finally, we succumb to the illusion of the terrorist: he believes that he performs a set of \u0026ldquo;special actions\u0026rdquo;; we agree with him and speak about \u0026ldquo;terrorist acts\u0026rdquo; all the time. In all these ways and more, we allow terrorism to feed on the success and legitimacy it enjoys by our acceptance of its self-description.\nConclusions\nThis, then, is our hypothesis: terrorism is the transformation of crime into supererogation. The ideology of crime enables such a trans-substantiation. Let us see how this accounts for some of the facts we already know about terrorism.\nTerrorism spreads, because it appears imitable. We have seen why terrorism can recruit ordinary moral subjects; that is why it is imitable. Anyone can become a terrorist. It can spread because the ideology of crime is neutral or indifferent with respect to religious, political and other beliefs. Terrorism appears to target its victims both indiscriminately and in a focused manner. As examples of the latter, consider the sustained attempts at assassinating various political dignitaries, heads of states, prominent politicians, UN personnel, etc. during the last decade. It is indifferent as to whom it targets because the \u0026ldquo;relevant\u0026rdquo; moral community of the terrorist undergoes changes over time. However, it is also focused because the terrorist is a member of a specific \u0026ldquo;relevant\u0026rdquo; moral community confronting a specific \u0026lsquo;other\u0026rsquo; at any one time. Terrorism inevitably bites the hand that feeds it, whether the hand that feeds it is a state (Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan, for example) or a movement (the Palestinian Liberation Organization). Terrorism has to turn against its own foundation because of the dictates of the ideology of crime. Terrorism inevitably disrupts civil society in multiple ways that are incommensurate with the act itself. For instance, 9/11 changed both the US and the world so much that it is difficult to speak of commensurate effects of the act itself. Terrorism disrupts society (and sows fear) in such disproportionate ways, because its ideology and its mechanism threaten the very existence of a moral community. Terrorism is surrounded by some kind of an ideology, which appears to provide a moral justification for the act. We have seen that the requirement of moral justification arises from the fact that the ideology of crime makes crime supererogatory. Terrorism generates two diametrically opposed ethical reactions. In some circles, the terrorists of today are the embodiments of the highest virtues and, as such, exemplars to imitate. In other circles, they generate moral horror and ethical abhorrence. That is, both make an appeal to ethical considerations. However, it appears as though these considerations are not merely different, but also opposed to each other. Consequently, terrorism and those others who feel moral aversion to it are mutually recognized as enemies-to-death. Each wants to eliminate the other. We explained why ethical responses are enticed by the ideology of crime and why the \u0026ldquo;moral us\u0026rdquo; and the \u0026ldquo;the immoral they\u0026rdquo; appear as enemies-to-death. Does this set of considerations generate policy conclusions? Yes, it does. Let us simply list a few of them.\nCrime cannot be abolished in a society by exterminating the criminal population at any given moment. We have to strike at what generates and sustains crime in a society. Overcoming terrorism, besides requiring a whole series of social, political and economic remedies, needs something extra as well: both public intellectuals and academics must begin dismantling the ideology of crime. This is not the same as identifying some \u0026ldquo;other\u0026rdquo; political or religious doctrines and discoursing about them. If we continue to hold \u0026ldquo;religion,\u0026rdquo; or even \u0026ldquo;religious fundamentalism\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Islamofascism\u0026rdquo; as the cause of terrorism, not only do we fail in addressing the real issues, but we end up feeding the ideology of crime by accepting the self-description of terrorism. The current craze in the American academy and public debate about Islam reflects how successful the ideology has been here. We need expert jurists, magistrates, and politicians to work on setting up provisions in criminal law that allow us to tackle the nature of this particular form of crime. However, such statutes, like all other legal statutes, should be tested for their admissibility within the moral and constitutional limits that we work under. The \u0026ldquo;war on terrorism\u0026rdquo; is sensible only to the extent we can speak about \u0026ldquo;war on crime.\u0026rdquo; In the same way criminals are a danger to civil society, terrorists are dangerous as well. But, as commentators have noted, the US government has vacillated between approaching terrorism as a violation of criminal law and as an issue of war. The first approach acknowledges that terrorism is but a form of crime and thus negates its ideology, while the second confirms the ideology and views the terrorists as warriors for a cause. This leads to conflicting policies that fail to respect both criminal law and the law of war. We feed the ideology of crime and terrorism when we treat the terrorists as \u0026ldquo;exceptional\u0026rdquo; individuals and, therefore, stray outside the established framework of law to bring them to justice. By setting up special military tribunals, by denying them their status as moral subjects, one concedes to the claims that the ideology of crime makes. One needs the framework of law and justice (why set up courts otherwise?) and, at the same time, denies both the requirements of law and justice (because they appear as \u0026ldquo;kangaroo courts\u0026rdquo; to the outside world). This is exactly what the ideology of crime does. In this sense, in bringing both the Guantanamo Bay and subsequent developments into existence, the ideology of crime has already begun to acquire moral legitimacy. Ethical considerations, which should provide the foundations for any kind of politics, have become subordinated to petty political and party considerations in the US. To stray away from ethical foundations, in pursuit of the requirements of \u0026ldquo;national interests\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;geo-political situations,\u0026rdquo; feeds the ideology of crime. Surely, Ronald Reagan\u0026rsquo;s statement that the Taliban are \u0026ldquo;freedom fighters\u0026rdquo; rather than terrorists, has come back to haunt us today. Any institution, community, organization, or movement that feeds or nurtures terrorism (directly or indirectly) will become its victim sooner or later. That is so, because such a bond allows the ideology of crime to become dynamic by transforming many different empirical communities into possible moral communities for the terrorists. If it is to fight terrorism and the ideology of crime, politics cannot afford to lose its moorings from an ethical foundation.

I mean: is the bhakta moved because, for example, the child who stole the butter happens to be the Kannan, or because the child, who also happens to be the Lord, stole the butter? If it is the first, it is worthless: it is the same as being a sycophant (as the Americans would put it: one sucks up to \u0026hellip;). If the second, it is false: surely, we are not moved to tears when our children steal and the lie about it. When the mother gets to hear from a child: \u0026ldquo;\u0026lsquo;I\u0026rsquo; did not steal\u0026rdquo; and, as proof, gets to see the \u0026lsquo;vishwarupa\u0026rsquo; (in the mouth where the speech manifests itself) and \u0026lsquo;sees\u0026rsquo; the Cosmos (all that ever was, is and shall be) in an \u0026lsquo;I\u0026rsquo; \u0026ndash; what is the question, and what the answer?\nCould we, that is, ordinary human beings that the most of us are, experience (or achieve the state of) bhakti? Why is it that the more one searches for it, the more distant and unreachable it becomes? (The analogy with finding \u0026rsquo;the true love\u0026rsquo; does not work here because one does not know what \u0026rsquo;true love\u0026rsquo; is, where to find it, and it uniquely varies from person to person. Our traditions (a) teach us about Bhakti, tell us that (b) with the help of a teacher, and (c) in the company of the dAsas, any person could find or achieve bhakti.) While a profoundly deep emotion appears to accompany Bhakti, the latter is not identical to the former. Why do I say this? In their search for Bhakti, and before they find it, most Bhaktas constantly lament \u0026ndash; with deep anguish \u0026ndash; that \u0026rsquo;the karunAmayi\u0026rsquo; does not appear to show \u0026lsquo;karuna\u0026rsquo; to them. Surely, during this phase, their emotions for the Lord (if this is what Bhakti is) is not (a) any less (quantitatively speaking) or (b) inauthentic or fake (c) or any different. If it was an emotional deficiency, why do these teachers not state this very obvious and simple truth about their own emotions (that both you and I seem to know)? The imagery of love is used to describe an emotional state (mostly of those who are searching for bhakti), but bhakti itself does not appear to fall together with a particular emotion. Here is yet another formulation of the above problem. One of the impediments to Bhakti, the enlightened seem to say, are our emotional attachments and entanglements in the world. They do not say that we are merely attached to the wrong objects and people, and that shifting the locus (or the focus) of these attachments is what bhakti is. However, they do say that bhakti shifts these emotional bonds from the worldly things onto the Lord. Does it not follow from this Bhakti cannot be an emotion but is accompanied by one? What amazes me (cognitively speaking) and drives me to despair and beyond (existentially speaking) is the singular absence of an issue of overriding importance. You see, our traditions tell us what it is to be in a state of ignorance (where most of us find ourselves in), how one is when one is searching, and what it is like when one has found it. (Call the \u0026lsquo;it\u0026rsquo;, the truth, bhakti, enlightenment, or whatever else you feel like.) What they do not tell us is also what all of us need to know: how did those who were successful make the transition from one state to the other? What helped them? Why do none of them speak about these, once they reach whatever they reached? Why do they merely tell us that the truth is staring us in our face, what that truth is, but not how they came to realize it? I mean, all of us \u0026lsquo;know\u0026rsquo; \u0026ndash; in some sense \u0026ndash; what they say. \u0026lsquo;Knowing\u0026rsquo; this does not help us; even \u0026lsquo;believing\u0026rsquo; in this truth does not bring us closer to whatever they were close to or united with. They too knew this truth while they were searching, and it was not adequate for them either. At some stage or another, they made the transition from a state of utter anguish to that of total \u0026lsquo;bliss\u0026rsquo;. What enabled them? Did they simply wake up one day with a profound realization, did a miracle occur, or is it something like the lottery? If none of these, why are all of them so quiet on this utterly, utterly crucial issue?

They do not believe in this claim anymore than I do. I do not accept this claim at all. From the many reasons I have for not accepting this ridiculous claim, let me mention just two. The first is my belief that my intellectual endeavors merely reproduce the macro-pattern of India on an atomic scale: my life is the Indian history writ small. I know far too many people on so many parallel paths involved in the kind of research I am doing to make myself believe that I am the genius the world has been waiting for. There is a second reason. The development of my story would have been impossible but for the existence of stories penned by other people and the earlier generations of both Indians and westerners. Every single error' and mistake\u0026rsquo; made by, say, the colonial writers on India is a problem to solve: why did they make the mistakes they did? Answers to this question constitute one of the parameters that render my story scientific. The scientificity of my story presupposes the errors' and mistakes\u0026rsquo; of the earlier generations. In much the same way, my errors and mistakes will be the presuppositions for the subsequent attempts in building a better theory.

Much like us, they tried to understand the world with the best tools they had. As the subsequent generation, we can improve on their work; this is the prerogative of each generation. The generations after us will improve upon our work, thankful to our mistakes they way we are of the labors of previous generations.\n","tags":[],"title":"Criticism: Are we living in barrenness?","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/criticism-are-we-living-in-barrenness/"},{"categories":["stories"],"content":"Of course there are any number of stories in other cultures, \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; included, about the creation of the world and what happened ever since. However, not every story about the creation of the world (let us stick to these kind of stories) has the quality of making the world \u0026rsquo;the Cosmos, that is\u0026rsquo; into an explanatorily intelligible entity. The Big-Bang theory is also a story about the creation of the world, but again, it misses the quality of the story told by religions, i.e. what explains the Cosmos is also what makes it intelligible. Or, as the Christians say: it was God\u0026rsquo;s will to create the world and His will was also the cause of the world\u0026rsquo;s existence. (Other dispositions attributed to God, such as His perfect goodness, etc. are important too, but I will ignore them here.) Given this, it is not clear to me what point you are trying to make. If it is your claim that the many stories in India are equivalent to the Biblical story in Christianity, you are wrong. This is exactly the assumption that was made by the missionaries when they confronted \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo;. The only difference is that, then, they were attacked as being \u0026lsquo;false\u0026rsquo; and that, now, they are hailed for expressing the beauty of the Indian \u0026lsquo;faith\u0026rsquo;.\nQuestions about the truth of the Biblical story, about whether or not Jesus of Nazareth ever existed, etc. are derived from religion being \u0026rsquo;the Truth\u0026rsquo;. A similar attitude towards stories is absent in India. Hence they must play a different role within the context of the Indian culture. This brings me to the last point: it could indeed be very productive if we start looking at the fact that India knows of so many \u0026lsquo;incredible\u0026rsquo; narratives from a different perspective. Why does India know of so many (contradictory) stories? What is the point in telling them if they are neither true nor false? To the Westerners they illustrate that the Indians are unreliable, or that they are \u0026lsquo;poetical\u0026rsquo; which means the same, etc.\n","tags":[],"title":"Creation stories: Christianity vs. Indian traditions","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/creation-stories-christianity-vs-indian-traditions/"},{"categories":["social sciences","Willem"],"content":"I do understand the anger that people feel when they read Jeffrey Kripal\u0026rsquo;s and other people\u0026rsquo;s assessment of Indian traditions. If someone were to come up with a similar distortion of my own cultural heritage, I would probably feel the same. However, I do feel troubled when people end up calling Kripal a \u0026ldquo;cheat\u0026rsquo;\u0026rsquo;, a \u0026ldquo;spiritual bandit\u0026rdquo; or begin to speculate about hidden \u0026lsquo;agendas\u0026rsquo;. My problem is not that these accusations are ad hominem. My problem is that they threaten to obscure a genuine intellectual problem of a more serious nature.\nTo make my point, I will approach the issue again from a European point of view. In contemporary Europe, both among the laity as well as among the intelligentsia, there is a genuine curiosity about other culture\u0026rsquo;s perspectives. In fact, this attitude has been a constant feature of Europe\u0026rsquo;s intellectual history from at least the period of Italian renaissance onwards. If one asks the question what keeps this sentiment alive, I believe that it would be a fair answer to say that it is the expectation of learning from other cultures. However, when one enters university, one soon discovers that there is \u0026ldquo;something wrong\u0026rdquo; with our knowledge about other cultures. Being exposed to faits divers of exotic nature from another culture might be fun at first. But after a while it becomes boring, even when the more \u0026ldquo;spicy\u0026rdquo; details are not withheld. The only change that occurs as one goes from the bachelors into the masters is the theoretical \u0026lsquo;sophistication\u0026rsquo;.\nAnd here the situation gets even worse. How could one possibly take other people\u0026rsquo;s perspectives seriously when they believe that jumping up and down will cause rain; when they think that lunar eclipses are caused by a dragon swallowing up the moon; or, for that matter, when it turns out that Ganesha\u0026rsquo;s trunk should actually be considered as a limp phallus? Please bear with me as I do not want to be polemical. I want to raise an important intellectual issue: Why is it that contemporary scholarship turns one of the most fascinating fields of research\u0026ndash;that of cultural differences\u0026ndash;into the most sterile activity? Why is that we Europeans expect to learn from other cultures, but end up producing nonsense, some of which rightly offends the sensibilities of the people concerned? It is my intention to raise these questions so that we might look at some of Kripal\u0026rsquo;s statements from another perspective.\nAs far as I am concerned, I have no reason to doubt Kripal\u0026rsquo;s sincerity; that is precisely the reason why his statements are all the more interesting. At first sight, it seems that Kripal has a strong case when he refers to some factual textual evidence which supports his homoerotic interpretation of Ramakrishna\u0026rsquo;s psychology. Instead of discussing whether or not this interpretation is correct, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that Kripal considers his conclusions as self-evident. He says: \u0026ldquo;now why does no one address these and other similar passages? And why are we not perfectly justified in reading the possibility of homoerotic dimensions here? I see nothing remotely wild or excessive or intellectually facile about such an idea.\u0026rdquo; If I read Kripal correctly, it seems that he asking out loud \u0026ldquo;how else could one interpret them if not in homoerotic terms?\u0026rdquo; One possible interpretation is to see a vicious mind at work here. I, on the other hand, would like to suggest that what we see here are the deeply ingrained constraints of one culture when it describes another.\nThe nature of these constraints becomes visible when we look at what one culture considers as self-evident when it confronts another. What is considered as self-evident depends on how we experience the world. Because this experience differs from culture to culture, different sensitivities provide us with valuable source material to start reflecting about cultural differences. To illustrate the point that I am trying to make, here are some random voices from a time long gone. in the early 18th century, the French Jesuit father Jacques Mauduit discussed the issue of lunar eclipses with some learned brahmins, who had no problem in admitting that the story about a dragon swallowing the moon was false. Sensing victory, the father then drew the attention of the brahmins to the fact that the stories about the Indian gods could not possibly be true either. It seems that they were willing to buy this as well, but they came up with the defense that, nevertheless, they could not do otherwise than worshiping these gods. Being frustrated about the reaction, this is how the father assessed the situation: \u0026ldquo;the brahmins calmly listened to me without being worried either about the contradictions with which they lived, or the ridiculous implications they were forced to admit.\u0026rdquo; For the missionary, it was self-evident that the Indians would change their behavior, once they recognized the true nature of their stories. That they did not do so necessarily colored the Jesuit\u0026rsquo;s experience of the Indians. As far as he was concerned, he had good reasons to believe that they were illogical and not willing to learn. This is another way of saying that the Indians were insensitive to logic or even stupid. On another occasion, father Pierre Martin expressed his happiness when he saw the native people\u0026rsquo;s reverence for saint Francis Xavier. At the same time, he was also very worried because he discovered that these natives placed the image of the catholic saint among the other images of their \u0026lsquo;false gods\u0026rsquo;. What troubled him most, however, was that they did so \u0026ldquo;despite the care with which they were instructed in the cult that was due to him.\u0026rdquo; Of course, the good father knew that the Indians were \u0026lsquo;devil worshippers\u0026rsquo;. But what bothered him was the Indians\u0026rsquo; refusal to learn. The implications were obvious: the Indians were either stubborn, or not to be trusted, or cheats, etc. this is how the missionary experienced the natives and, as far as he was concerned, he did have convincing reasons too. \u0026ldquo;How else could one interpret their behavior?\u0026rdquo; This Jesuit might well have asked. These and similar examples, found in the very influential collection of the so-called lettres édifiantes et curieuses (the collection of letters written by the Christian priests in India to the holy see), show us that the missionaries were not \u0026ldquo;spiritual bandits\u0026rdquo; when they criticized the Indians. This is how they experienced the native\u0026rsquo;s behavior and they had good reasons to believe that their experience was correct.\nI do not have the time; nor is there space to delve deeper into the background of this problematic. For those interested in this matter, I refer to Balagangadhara\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;The Heathen in His Blindness: Asia, the West and the dynamic of religion\u0026rsquo;. All I want to do here is emphasize that westerners indeed produced a distorted image of India. However, instead of looking for individual motifs, I suggest that it would be intellectually more productive if we start looking at this phenomenon from a cultural point of view. Kripal is no \u0026ldquo;cheat\u0026rdquo; nor is he a \u0026ldquo;spiritual bandit\u0026rdquo;. He even does not have an \u0026ldquo;agenda\u0026rdquo;. Kripal exemplifies the constraints of one culture looking at another. What these constraints are, how they operate, how they are sustained and reproduced, etc. are questions that should bother us the most here.\n","tags":["Jeffrey Kripal"],"title":"Does Kripal have an agenda?","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/kripal-does-not-have-an-agenda-nor-is-he-dishonest-willem-derde/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","Christianity","enlightenment","Indian traditions"],"content":"(1) What is called \u0026lsquo;mysticism\u0026rsquo; in the western culture is not the same kind of experience that the different Indian traditions talk about.

I want to go further in exploring the significance of these points and in exploring this state of \u0026rsquo;enlightenment\u0026rsquo; that the Indian traditions talk about.\n(A) Let me use the word \u0026lsquo;spirituality\u0026rsquo; as a general term so that I can speak of Christian (or Jewish or Islamic) spirituality and the Indian one. This allows an indiscriminate lumping of both \u0026lsquo;Buddhism\u0026rsquo; and Meister Eckhart together (for the moment) without, as yet, distinguishing them. It might be useful to have such a general term in order to undertake a distinction at a subsequent stage.\nSuppose that I say the following: Christian (Judaic, Islamic) mysticism is human spirituality misguided by Christian (Judaic, Islamic) religion. Would this sentence make some \u0026lsquo;intuitive\u0026rsquo; sense?\nOr, if I say: What is wrong with Christian (Judaic, Islamic) mysticism? Nothing, except that it is Christian (Judaic, Islamic). Would this make sense to you? I need to emphasize that I am not denigrating these religions. I am speaking of it this way in order to draw attention to the following claim: in so far as each human being can be a spiritual being (i.e. has the \u0026lsquo;potential\u0026rsquo; to become one), those in whom such a potential develops within the framework of a religion (like the three I talked about) can only become misguided, or deformed, warped or stunted. That is, the \u0026lsquo;incoherence\u0026rsquo; of the western mystics has to do with the framework within which a particular kind of potential tries (and fails) to become an actuality. Put differently: Western mysticism is a stunted, deformed, warped human spirituality. This misguiding occurs because of religion (that Judaism, Christianity and Islam are).\n(B) As compensation, these religions can cultivate (among their believers) something we do not have: religiosity or religious experience. To have such an experience requires having precisely the kind of framework that warps human spirituality and it can only be developed within such a framework. In fact, one could even allow a gradation here between the \u0026lsquo;deeply religious\u0026rsquo; and those who have had the kind of experience I am talking about by reserving the term \u0026lsquo;religious spirituality\u0026rsquo; for them. Then we get notions like Christian (Judaic, Islamic) spirituality. What kind of an experience could that be? Well, those that the hagiographies and biographies of \u0026lsquo;Saints\u0026rsquo; (among others) describe: experiencing the love of God, i.e., in the imagery of Saint Augustine, experiencing the love of God for contemptible sinners like you.\n(C) Of course, if we use \u0026lsquo;spirituality\u0026rsquo; in this context with this meaning, we need to give up the general notion introduced in (A).\nFor more on Christian monks, check this.\n","tags":[],"title":"Enlightenment vs. Mysticism","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/enlightenment-vs-mysticism/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara"],"content":"Some have expressed the \u0026lsquo;opinion\u0026rsquo; that we should all be properly grateful that people express a point of view, even if they do not enter into a debate with the readers, and that the reader should either take this or leave it. Such opinions are based on either a shallow or wrong understanding of what the \u0026lsquo;freedom\u0026rsquo; to express one\u0026rsquo;s opinion is all about. The legal system does not allow one to \u0026lsquo;simply\u0026rsquo; express one\u0026rsquo;s point of view and \u0026rsquo;leave it at that\u0026rsquo;: the existence of defamation suits is ample testimony to this.

When the latter is challenged, the demands of rationality oblige them to respond. For whatever it is worth, they appeal to their membership in the academia as researches and scientists too.

In this post, I want to highlight one of the consequences of transforming our experiences in this fashion. In at least two different ways, these explanations hinder the emergence of alternative or different explanations of our experiences. This is relevant to both of us. That is why, when confronted with such explanations, we do not know what to say. These explanations rob us not only of our experience; while doing so, they shut us up as well. As far as you are concerned, while rendering you deaf to the silence from our end, it further blinds you. If this is the case, one might as well ask oneself what you describe. Are you describing what you \u0026lsquo;see\u0026rsquo; in the mystical Ramakrishna? You could not: after all, what can you see, when you are blind? Nor it could be that you describe what you hear: you have become deaf to us. What, then, are you describing when you describe your experience? This issue is what this post will be about.\nOne of the most valuable and important facts about the growth of scientific theories (in the natural sciences) is the emergence of new problems even as some old ones are solved. The possibility that new problems come into existence because of a new solution to a current problem keeps the sciences growing. For example, when one \u0026lsquo;determined\u0026rsquo; the boiling point of water, questions came up about its variations at different heights from the sea level. When the relation between pressure and volume was formulated as a physical law, issues emerged which led one to talk about \u0026lsquo;inter-molecular forces\u0026rsquo; and so on. When the legs of the dead frog were observed to twitch when electricity passed through them, it raised many new problems even though it was not clear who should answer them: did the problems belong to the domain of physiology or to the domain of Electricity and Magnetism? And so on. In other words, a particular solution to some or another problem (in so far as the history of our sciences is concerned) has not failed to lay a foundation for the emergence of a newer and \u0026lsquo;relatively better\u0026rsquo; solutions. As a rule of thumb, one might say that while evaluating the acceptability of a proposed solution to a problem, one takes into account the \u0026lsquo;vulnerability\u0026rsquo; of such a theory. That is, does the theory hint in the direction of problems it cannot solve, or does it at least generate new problems? Science, one might as well say, is not only a problem solving activity but also a problem generating one. It creates new problems. Even if one does not accept the brief adumbration given above, it appears to me that at least the following (negative) requirement is acceptable: no explanation should \u0026lsquo;forbid\u0026rsquo; the emergence of alternative explanations. Even Christian theology, with its ultimate answer \u0026lsquo;it is the Will of God that such and such is the case\u0026rsquo;, does not shut out further enquiries because it speaks of the revelations of such a Will. Even if we cannot know what God\u0026rsquo;s Will is, we can study the revelations of such a Will and try to figure out what God intends. In short, where possible, we should avoid explanations that render us incapable of seeking another. In fact, some philosophers of science make this into a condition of theory choice itself. They argue that choosing a scientific theory presupposes the presence of alternative, competing or rival theories. Only under these conditions, they think, is progress in science possible. Whatever your views on the matter of scientific progress and scientific growth, I am sure we can both accept the minimal proposal I make: it is rational to choose an explanation that does not \u0026lsquo;forbid\u0026rsquo; the emergence of an alternative explanation. We should prefer these kinds of explanations to those that forbid a cognitive alternative. If you are with me so far, I can now formulate (more sharply) what I suggested in the first paragraph. Your endorsement of the Freudian explanation to account for some aspects of the Indian traditions makes the emergence of an alternative explanation impossible, both for you and for us.\nLet me begin with the Indians. I suppose that you have no problem in accepting the suggestion that theories about cultural worlds have their roots in the experiences of such worlds. These theories describe experiences; they reflect on experiences; they problematize such experiences and think through them. In other words, if I want to theorize about the Indian culture, I need to have access to an experience of the Indian culture (whether directly or indirectly). As I said in my previous post, the explanation that Linga is a male fertility symbol (i.e. a penis) denied any further access to my own experience. The holding of hands between friends was transformed into a sign of homosexual affection, because of which I could neither continue the action nor remember the way I experienced it before. In other words, such explanations not only deny our experiences to us because of which we cannot theorize or describe them anymore, but also do so actively. These explanations act as a filter between our own experiences and us. In one sense, all theories act as some kind of a filter: they select some salient aspect of the experience and focus upon it. In the case we are talking about, the situation is not the same. These purported explanations act as a distorting glass. I knew I had such experiences; I saw that others apparently continued to have the experiences I had before (I still see adult male friends holding hands, I still see people going to do puja to the Shiva Linga, etc); I know too that I have had these but I cannot access them anymore because of these explanations. That is, these explanations come actively between my own experiences and me, and actively prevent me from describing or reflecting on my own experiences. Therefore, in so far as one continues to use these explanations to describe what people do in Shiva\u0026rsquo;s temple, what we say is not what we see. Because these explanations are theorizations of someone else\u0026rsquo;s experiences, we cannot see what we say either. Do I really \u0026lsquo;see\u0026rsquo; the homosexuality of my friend when he holds my hands? Do I really \u0026lsquo;see\u0026rsquo; the penis when I look at the Lingam? No, I do not.\nHence the feeling of \u0026lsquo;wrongness\u0026rsquo; with respect to these explanations. Our experiences of the world and the explanations we use are at loggerheads with each other: without speaking about experience, one cannot say what the \u0026lsquo;Indian experience\u0026rsquo; consists of; the stories we reproduce tell us that there is no \u0026lsquo;Indian experience\u0026rsquo; to talk about. The result? One merely falls silent, our mouths stitched tight together, as dumb as human beings can get. This is no tearjerker but the lot and daily life of cultures and peoples colonized by the western culture. The colonization, as many have pointed out, was not merely a process of occupying lands and extracting revenues. It goes deeper. It is not a question of aping the western countries and trying to be like them. It is not even colonizing the imaginations of a people by making them \u0026lsquo;dream\u0026rsquo; that they should become \u0026lsquo;modern\u0026rsquo;, developed and sophisticated. It is deeper than this too. It is one of denying the peoples and cultures their own experiences; of rendering them aliens to themselves; of actively preventing any description of their own experiences except in terms defined by the colonizers. The terms of these descriptions, as said already, prevent the \u0026rsquo;native\u0026rsquo; from discovering himself. Of course, there is a very substantial issue here that I cannot address. Why do we, the Indians, continue to be colonized when the \u0026lsquo;real event\u0026rsquo; ended more than fifty years ago? At the moment, I have only fragmentary answers that do not form a coherent pattern; none of the extant answers even remotely address the issue in either its depth or complexity. Consequently, I will merely register this state of affairs. Besides, it is not directly relevant to this post either.\nThis is why we become dumb, Jeffrey Kripal. But how did you become blind? This part is also interesting in its own right, irrespective whether you hear our silence or not. To appreciate it, let us take a step back from the psychoanalytical explanations and ask ourselves the following question: which problem was Freud trying to solve? There were, of course, many: he wanted to investigate into the nature of \u0026lsquo;hysteria\u0026rsquo;; he wanted to figure out the story behind incest fantasies; he wanted to understand the slips of the tongue, etc. I do not mean any of these. What is the problem behind these issues? Philosophers of science identify such problems as the \u0026lsquo;problem-situation\u0026rsquo;. What then was Freud\u0026rsquo;s problem-situation? Both the nature of the psychoanalytic practice and the structure (and content) of the psychoanalytical explanations give us ample clues in the direction of an answer. In its blandest form, it is this: \u0026ldquo;Is one\u0026rsquo;s experience in the world (especially about oneself and the others) veridical (i.e. true)?\u0026rdquo; If we keep in mind what I have said hitherto and what you implicitly assume, it can be put even more provocatively: Is the experience of an individual directly accessible to the individual whose experience it is?\nFreud\u0026rsquo;s answer is known: no, he said, one can access one\u0026rsquo;s own experience only through the mediation of another, in casu, the psychoanalyst. This is not the only reason why Freud\u0026rsquo;s story appears unbelievable. There is something else of importance as well. I am sure you will admit that not only the notion of experience but also its existence is of crucial importance to us human beings. We think that experience is valuable important; it is both the source of and the precondition for most learning. Given its centrality to human existence, one would naturally expect the western tradition to be bothered about figuring out what this \u0026rsquo;experience\u0026rsquo; is all about. Yet, amazingly enough as it turns out, such is not the case. Despite books and articles in many, many disciplines bearing the title, the nature of \u0026rsquo;experience\u0026rsquo; is hardly studied. More often than not, it is reduced to thoughts, feelings, perception (or even sensation) and action. None of these, either severally or jointly exhausts experience because one could experience any or all of them as well. Thus, what is \u0026rsquo;experience\u0026rsquo;? An important question, but very ill understood. Such being the case, Freud\u0026rsquo;s observation and his sensing of the \u0026lsquo;problem-situation\u0026rsquo; is very sensitive indeed. Of course, he hypothesized that the individual experience is not directly accessible to the said individual, and postulated many mechanisms to account for this non-accessibility. We need take no sides on the \u0026lsquo;validity\u0026rsquo; or otherwise of his individual hypotheses in this post even though I will return to this issue in another way at the end of this post.\nThere is, however, another culture in the world, which has made this \u0026lsquo;problem-situation\u0026rsquo; an absolutely central focus of its enquiry. All the Indian traditions, without any major exception as far as I know, have made experience and its interrogation central to their enquiry. Naturally, they too discovered that experience is not \u0026lsquo;veridical\u0026rsquo;; there are \u0026rsquo;things\u0026rsquo; that prevent us from accessing these experiences. Different traditions called it different things: Maaya, Avidya and Agyana, are the best-known categories in this context. They called it a \u0026lsquo;paapa\u0026rsquo; and, in fact, removing this has been their central goal: Gyaanoodaya or the \u0026lsquo;arising of knowledge\u0026rsquo; (again, it is called differently by different traditions). The hindrances to knowledge were either \u0026lsquo;illusions\u0026rsquo; (of sorts) or ignorance (of sorts). One could remove them, they said, and developed any number of practical ways of doing so. (The plurality of the Indian traditions is partly a plurality of the ways of removing the veil of ignorance.) Though ill understood among most Indologists and philosophers, these notions are crucial. \u0026lsquo;Ignorance\u0026rsquo; is not mere \u0026lsquo;absence of information\u0026rsquo;; it is accorded a positive role, and seen as a positive force that actively hinders the emergence of knowledge. Maya is not mere illusion; the world exists and impinges upon us too much to make the facile claim of the sort that Patrick Hogan talks about in his article on Sulekha. In any case, these traditions believed too that some kind of \u0026lsquo;mediation\u0026rsquo; would be helpful in accessing one\u0026rsquo;s own experience. They called such a mediator \u0026lsquo;Guru\u0026rsquo; and suggested that, in most cases, one needed a Guru to achieve \u0026rsquo;enlightenment\u0026rsquo;.\nIn other words, Jeffrey Kripal, there exist two rival or competing practical traditions that address themselves to the same (or very, very similar) problem-situation. By virtue of this, they become rival or competing research traditions that provide different answers. Why did you not look at these Indian traditions in this way to understand Kali\u0026rsquo;s Child? The Indian traditions challenge Freud\u0026rsquo;s theories. Why did you not look at the issue in this manner? It is not as though you are ignorant of the Indian traditions. Even if you are, your mentor Wendy Doniger is supposed to be the expert on \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo;. Why did it not occur either to her or to you that the theories you used were already facing challenges from within the Indian traditions? Here is my simple answer: your explanations have blinded you to the existence of Indian traditions as alternatives to Freud.\nIt is in this sense that these explanations blind you. You already know how they make us dumb. Since you have used Freud to \u0026rsquo;explain\u0026rsquo; its rival traditions, allow me the simple courtesy of returning the favor. How does Freud appear to those who are within the Indian traditions? If you put this mail alongside my previous one, the answer must be obvious. Freud\u0026rsquo;s story is Maaya, avidya, agyaana: by actively preventing the arising of knowledge, it is indeed avidya. My brother and apparently many others like him on Sulekha board, hit the nail right on the head when they look at descriptions provided by you, Wendy and the rest of her children and say: it is a paapa to do so. They are neither naïve nor stupid when they say this; instead, they are perfectly rational and perfectly right.\nYou say, as though rediscovering the wheel, \u0026ldquo;it is sex. It is always sex.\u0026rdquo; I was intrigued by the possibility whether you knew what you were talking about. Did you mean \u0026lsquo;sex\u0026rsquo; or did you mean \u0026lsquo;sexuality\u0026rsquo;? Have you thought much about the growth of \u0026lsquo;sexuality\u0026rsquo; in the western culture and its obsession with the same? Foucault, for instance, understood neither. That is why he wrote his multi-volume work on the history of sexuality in the western culture. Whether one agrees with him or not, he at least thought that there was another culture that did not think that \u0026ldquo;it is sex, it is always sex.\u0026rdquo; May be, another peek at these books might be of some help.\nBe it as that may, I have written at least a part of what I want to. Should you want a \u0026lsquo;dialogue\u0026rsquo;, you might think of taking up the some of the questions people have raised. Alternately, you could also keep quiet. Silence does talk, even if it does not always say what one would like to hear. In this case, I suspect you would not want to know what silence is going to say about you.\n","tags":["Wendy Doniger"],"title":"Hindering the emergence of alternative explanations: Colonialism","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/hindering-the-emergence-of-alternative-explanations-colonialism/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","colonial consciousness"],"content":"As I see it, the issue is not whether Arun Shourie is an intellectual (or whether Prakash Karat and EMS Namboodaripad represent intellectuals).

Any movement that captures the imagination of a people (or even of a cross-section of a people) has to have some or another kind of narrative. Normally, the crafting of such a narrative involves the labor of intellectuals. Congress had one such when it was a mass movement; however, it lost that narrative in the course of the last decades. In the process of losing its own narrative, it has also accommodated multiple voices and narrators: the so-called \u0026lsquo;radical\u0026rsquo; intellectuals in India have prospered under the congress rule.

The fact that BJP gets characterized in different ways (\u0026lsquo;Hindu Fundamentalist\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;Fascist\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;Nationalist\u0026rsquo;, etc) by different people indicates that these characterizations have more to do with the theory that one accepts about these phenomena (\u0026lsquo;religious fundamentalism\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;fascism\u0026rsquo;, \u0026rsquo;nationalism\u0026rsquo;, etc) than they have to do with the \u0026lsquo;story\u0026rsquo; that BJP tells. Furthermore, the BJP is also hostile to intellectuals: in fact, it is very typical to hear them identify \u0026lsquo;intellectuals\u0026rsquo; with \u0026lsquo;secular thinkers\u0026rsquo;. It is almost as though they think that this social layer, which the intellectuals are, is an \u0026lsquo;alien growth\u0026rsquo; in the Indian culture, something that the British created. While it is undoubtedly true that the kind of academic intellectuals we have today are outgrowths of colonial and post-colonial developments, this situation does not quite explain the hostility of the BJP. Hostility towards knowledge is not \u0026rsquo;native\u0026rsquo; to the Indian culture. At the same time, BJP is not hostile to something that is really \u0026lsquo;alien\u0026rsquo; to Indian culture: Nationalism. Instead, the \u0026lsquo;ideologues\u0026rsquo; of the BJP try to spin a deeply \u0026rsquo;nationalist\u0026rsquo; story.\nThe relationship between the BJP and intellectuals is only one side of the puzzle. The other side has to do with the Indian society. What kind of resonance is/was there between the Indian society and the BJP? Why is there no new crop of intellectuals trying to theorize what BJP has only dimply sensed? Is there some relationship between the absence of such intellectuals and what I call \u0026lsquo;colonial consciousness\u0026rsquo;?\nWhen I say that it is not clear to me why BJP has not produced intellectuals and knows only of ideologues, I have something like the above situation in my mind.\nComments Bahu Virupaksha — 2016-07-07 17:36:30\nIt is not thst the BJP lacks a narrative:it has not taken the trouble of putting it together. The charge that BJP did not participate in the do called National Movement is rasiky answered when we draw attention to the fact that tge contradictions within tgeovement led to Partition and tge Congress generated mass movement was the start point of Partition. The so called communsl\u0026rsquo; tag that is given can be answered by pointing out that the Hindu Mahasabha was founded by the Congress Party and thst jokers in tight pyjamas started talking about communalism only as a factional shield to ward off attack from the real nationalists. BJPn the right has not taken the trouble of encouraging academics.\nbmcowl — 2016-07-21 19:26:39\nBJP is run by boy scout type of naivety, do good for all without any charisma or philosophy. BJP and RSS hard core have never been able to rise above school book anti-history to evolve into a Hindu based national vision without which Abrahamic despots will end their own Vedic roots.\nbmcowl — 2016-11-06 19:58:53\nBJP is actually run as a one man theocracy where PM Modi can rise no farther than his tea seller roots. No wonder he has concentrated all his efforts on economic development and woos those sections of the society that have never been BJP electorate. Modi is trying to outshine Gandhi in appeasement to quell outcry from media and seculars. He has no historical vision to develop a charisma whose roots can only be nourished by Vedic Hindu ideation, not Abrahamic despotism. Blind bhakts are dreaming of a change in course in 2017 which has never been in the making as yet another U-turn will be suicidal. BJP can still retain power in 2019 with reduced majority on the ashes of Hindu aspirations. It is too naïve to think that Abrahamics will vote for BJP precisely because BJP has NO intellectual base to tackle social issues.\n","tags":[],"title":"BJP does not have Intellectuals!","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/bjp-does-not-have-intellectuals/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","secular","secularism","secularization"],"content":"The theories (and discussions) about secularism constitute a test case for the claims advanced in \u0026lsquo;The Heathen in his blindness: Asia, the West and the dynamic of religion\u0026rsquo; about the universalizing drive of religion. I have suggested that religion spreads by secularizing itself, and that the distinction between the secular and the religious is drawn by and within a religion. If this is the case, then it must be possible to show that the current theories of secularism are secularizations of a particular set of theological claims. (Theology draws these distinctions and defends them.)\nBecause we are talking about empirical entities like the western culture, theories of secularism, etc. we are talking about the secularization of a specific religion and its claims, viz., Christianity. There are two kinds of questions: (a) Which Christian doctrines masquerade as secular doctrines in the theories about secularism? (b) What makes these Christian doctrines religious?\nCurrently, we are not even tackling the second question. This question is too complex and there is a lack of clarity as to what would constitute an answer. (I have only a general answer, which is found in `The Heathen …\u0026rsquo;) However, the first question is answered in two ways: (1) by developing a hypothesis about the structure underlying the theories of secularism; (2) by showing that this structure makes sense if and only if we make additional assumptions about Man and Society that Christianity makes.\nThe second answer is still too abstract. Jakob finished his doctorate on the issue of the rise of doctrines of \u0026lsquo;religious tolerance\u0026rsquo;. In his thesis, which is going to take the form of a first version of the book, it will be shown that all the political theories that we know of today (whether conservative or liberal) make a set assumptions that is continuous with different Christian theologies. The distinction of \u0026rsquo;the secular\u0026rsquo; and \u0026rsquo;the religious\u0026rsquo; itself will be shown to depend upon assumptions that Christian theology makes. (This will be done in detail.)\nThen, we will show that the theses that liberal theories advance (with respect to the issue at hand) are derivable from these theological assumptions. That is, the liberal theories are \u0026rsquo;true\u0026rsquo;, if and only if the theological premises they use are also \u0026rsquo;true\u0026rsquo;. If it can be further shown that, empirically speaking, the western theorists explicitly assumed the truth of these assumptions in their attempts to build theories of state and politics, then we will have shown that their claims are theological in nature. If, furthermore, the later theorists assume the truth of the claims advanced by the earlier theorists, or merely tinker with them, they will be doing secularized theology.\nIn other words, all that can be shown is that the current theories of secularism (as they are now) presuppose the truth of Christian theological claims. The latter are about, as I said before, Man and Society. There must be a semantic and logical relationship between current theories of secularism and Christian theologies about the relationship between the secular\u0026rsquo; and \u0026rsquo;the religious\u0026rsquo;. (And, among other things, that relationship is one of logical entailment.)\nThus, if we can show that (a) historically, there are no other assumptions present than theological ones; (b) show that there is a semantic and logical relationship between theological claims and the theories of secularism; then (c) we show that theories of secularism are secularizations of Christian theologies.\nIf this argument is true, your question about the identifying marks of secularism is answered. Secularism is recognizable as an object given a theory (ie. theology) about it. The identifiable markers are those that Christian theologies provide to identify the object. That is to say, without using Christian theology, you lack a way to identify the object called \u0026lsquo;secularism\u0026rsquo;. (This can also be put in an intuitive way thus: the Indian distinction between the \u0026rsquo;laukika\u0026rsquo; and the \u0026lsquo;adhyatmika\u0026rsquo; does not overlap with the `secular\u0026rsquo; and the \u0026lsquo;religious\u0026rsquo; distinction.)\n","tags":[],"title":"Is  laukika-adhyatimika distinction same as secular-sacred distinction?","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/is-the-distinction-between-laukika-and-adhyatimika-same-as-that-between-secular-and-religious/"},{"categories":["Jakob"],"content":"Recently, the European Parliament hosted a meeting on \u0026ldquo;caste discrimination in South Asia\u0026rdquo;. At the meeting, participants stated that \u0026ldquo;India is being ruled by castes not by laws\u0026rdquo; and that they demanded justice, because there \u0026ldquo;is one incredible India and one untouchable India.\u0026rdquo; The EU was urged to come out with a policy statement on the subject. One MEP, referring to the caste system, said that \u0026ldquo;this barbarism has to end.\u0026rdquo; This is not the first time. However, before the EU decides to publish policy statements on caste discrimination in India, we would do well to reflect on some simple facts.\nFirst, the dominant conception of the caste system has emerged from the accounts by Christian missionaries, travelers and colonial administrators. Rather than being neutral, these accounts were shaped by a Christian framework. That is, the religion of European visitors to India had informed them beforehand that they would find false religion and devil worship there, and that false religion always manifested itself in social evils. Especially the Protestants rebuked the \u0026ldquo;evil priests\u0026rdquo; of Hinduism for imposing the laws of caste in the name of religion. They told the Indians that conversion to Protestantism was a conversion to equality. Thus, Indian souls were to be saved from damnation and caste discrimination.\nSecond, this Christian account of \u0026ldquo;the Hindu religion\u0026rdquo; and its \u0026ldquo;caste system\u0026rdquo; informed colonial policies in British India. Building on the theological framework, scholars now wrote \u0026ldquo;scientific\u0026rdquo; treatises on Hindu superstition and caste discrimination. The Christian mission found its secular counterpart in the idea of the civilizing mission, which told the West that it had to rescue the natives from the clutches of superstition and caste. One no longer promoted religious conversion, but the colonial educational system harped on \u0026ldquo;the horrors of Hindu society.\u0026rdquo;\nThird, the colonial educational project had a deep impact on the Indian intelligentsia. Hindu reform and anti-caste movements came into being, which reproduced the Protestant accounts of Hinduism and caste as true descriptions of India. Their advocates did not adopt these descriptions as passive recipients, but actively deployed them to pursue socioeconomic and political interests. Political parties and caste associations were created to safeguard the interests of the \u0026ldquo;lower castes.\u0026rdquo; The elites of these groups united in associations and received financial and moral support from the missionaries and other progressive colonials.\nFourth, the \u0026ldquo;Dalit\u0026rdquo; movement of today is the product of these colonial movements. The notion of \u0026ldquo;Dalits\u0026rdquo; makes sense only within the colonial account of India, which had postulated the existence of one single group of \u0026ldquo;outcastes\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;untouchables\u0026rdquo; that was supposedly exploited by the upper castes. In reality, it concerns a variety of caste groups, with no criteria to unite them besides the claim that they are all \u0026ldquo;downtrodden.\u0026rdquo; Indeed, many of these groups are poor and discriminated against by other caste groups. However, their socio-economic interests have been hijacked by some of their western-educated elite members. In the name of the downtrodden, these elites establish NGOs and then travel from conference to conference and country to country in order to reveal the plight of the \u0026ldquo;Dalits\u0026rdquo; to eager western audiences and secure funding from donor agencies.\nFifth, when present-day Europeans rebuke Indian society for the \u0026ldquo;barbarism\u0026rdquo; of caste discrimination, they are reproducing the old stanzas of the civilizing mission. Such a stance of superiority perhaps worked in the context of colonialism. But today, at a time when Indians buy some of the European industrial giants and Europe is in need of more collaboration with India, it is ill-advised to continue this type of civilizational propaganda.\nIn fact, such propaganda derives its plausibility from a series of assumptions that no one would be willing to defend explicitly. It attributes all socioeconomic wrongs of the Indian society to its structure and civilization. The implication is that there is only one way to get rid of socio-economic wrongs here: one has to eradicate both the social structure and the Hindu civilization. It is as though one would blame the racism, binge drinking, pedophilia, poverty, homelessness and domestic violence in the contemporary West on its age-old civilization.\nThe times have changed. As Europeans, we need to reflect on our deep-rooted sense of superiority and how this informs our moralizing discourse on human rights in other parts of the world. To appreciate the impression we give to Indians with our statements on caste discrimination, just imagine a possible world in which the Indian government regularly castigates the US for its racism against African-Americans and the disproportionate death penalties, and the EU for the treatment of South Asians in England, Turks in Germany, women in Romania, the Basque movement in Spain, gypsies in Italy \u0026hellip; just imagine Indian members of parliament consistently blaming the very structure of western societies as the cause of all these wrongs. Europe needs to wake up fast. The time of colonialism is over. If we do not change our attitudes, the irritation towards the EU will grow in countries like India and China. So will the unwillingness to collaborate. In the fast-changing world of the early 21st Century, Europe cannot afford this.\nFrom New Europe, Issue 786\n","tags":[],"title":"Does Europe have a civilizing mission in India?","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/does-europe-have-a-civilizing-mission-in-india/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","Edward Said","orientalism","published"],"content":"[Original, published in ASIANetwork Exchange XVI (1): 57–63.]\nDuring the last two decades, I have been pursuing an unorthodox way of studying cultural differences, focusing mainly on the Indian and the western cultures. Because I believe that one can answer questions about the circumscription of the words \u0026lsquo;Indian\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;western\u0026rsquo; cultures satisfactorily (Balangangadhara, 1994), I will assume their intelligibility in what follows. In this paper, I want to raise a rather intriguing problem about comparing these two cultures. I shall do that without looking at other approaches to the issue and in the form of an argument. In order to come to the point quickly, let me make use of Said\u0026rsquo;s Orientalism.\nThe Challenge of Orientalism\nHow best should we look at Orientalist discourse? One way: it as a description of the Orient. The second way: it is a description of the western experience of the Orient. I believe the latter to be the case. If we accept that \u0026lsquo;Orientalism\u0026rsquo; is how the western culture came to terms with the reality that the East is, then, \u0026lsquo;Orientalism\u0026rsquo; refers not only to the discourse about experience but also to the way of reflecting about and structuring this experience. In this sense, even though Orientalism is a discourse about western cultural experience, it is oblique. It is oblique because it appears to be about other cultures. It is \u0026lsquo;western\u0026rsquo; in the sense that it refers to the experiences of the members from a particular culture. Orientalism is the western way of thinking about its experience of non-western cultures. However, it takes the form of an apparent discourse about the Orient.\nIn this process, western culture built and elaborated conceptual frameworks using resources available from its own culture. These descriptions helped in Europe\u0026rsquo;s description and understanding of itself. That is to say, Europe\u0026rsquo;s description of other cultures is fundamentally entwined in many untold ways with the way it has experienced the world. The challenge of Orientalism, thus, is a challenge to understand the western culture. That is, to understand the self-description of the West and the way it has described the others is to begin understanding western culture itself.\nWestern Culture from a Comparative Perspective\nI want to draw out one of the implications of this argument explicitly. If we study a culture this way, we begin by conceptualizing the subject matter of our study itself, which is the western culture, in a comparative way. The West is what it says about the others and itself. We compare what it says about the others with what it says about itself in order to find a common conceptual structure. In one sense, this stance is congruent with the insight we have about human beings: when a person describes another human being, the resulting description tells us much about the describer himself. The same holds good at the level of individual descriptions provided by members of a particular culture. In other words, if there is a common conceptual structure to the European descriptions of India, then such a structure reflects a shared and common European culture. The research that both predates and postdates Said\u0026rsquo;s Orientalism tells us that such a structure is present. If the same structure is found to be present in its self-description, then we can justifiably say that such a structure is the western culture. This argument also provides us with a methodology to objectively, non-arbitrarily and scientifically study the western culture in a comparative way. Since I have no time to elaborate on this point, let me leave it here and turn my attention to see whether the same consideration holds good with respect to India.\nAt first sight, it looks as though this insight should also work when we study the Indian culture: that culture too is what it says about itself and what it says about the \u0026lsquo;others\u0026rsquo;. If we dig into the Indian intellectual traditions with this expectation, we are bound to come out puzzled: (a) the \u0026rsquo;native\u0026rsquo; Indian traditions have produced very little about themselves and even less about \u0026rsquo;the others\u0026rsquo;; (b) the modern Indian intelligentsia appears to merely reproduce the western descriptions of India and the western culture. How to understand or explain these facts and what do they say about a comparative study of the Indian culture?\nLet us look at these questions separately and begin with the issue about the absence of \u0026rsquo;native\u0026rsquo; Indian descriptions about themselves and the others. What exactly is absent in the Indian traditions? Let me take three randomly chosen topics: religion and God; ethics; social structure.\nThe standard text-book trivia which we teach our students routinely assure us not only that there are multiple \u0026rsquo;native\u0026rsquo; religions in India (Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, different forms of Saivism, multiple varieties of Vaisnavism, the Bhakti movements, Sikhism, and many more and other kinds of \u0026lsquo;popular\u0026rsquo; religions) but also that they arose in conflict with the ruling \u0026lsquo;orthodoxies\u0026rsquo;. For instance, the pure Vedic religion is supposed to have given birth to a degenerate \u0026lsquo;Brahmanism\u0026rsquo;. The Sramana traditions (exemplified by both Jainism and Buddhism) are alleged to have fought Brahmanism. The latter itself is said to have mutated into \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo;, partially strengthened by Advaitic religion that fought Buddhism and so on. In such a case, one would expect a huge volume of literature regarding religion (what religion is, what these individual religions are, etc) and even more literature in theology. After all, both Buddhism and Jainism deny God, do they not? Yet, there is hardly any theology in India (if we look at Christianity as an example of what it means to write theological tracts) and there is hardly any explicit reflection on the nature of religion. All one needs is an acquaintance with the history of Christianity to notice how staggering this absence is. To this day, neither the scholar nor the layman can answer the question about what makes, say, \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; into a religion or what that \u0026lsquo;Brahmanism\u0026rsquo; is which Buddhism fought. Are we to seriously believe that Buddhism, as a religion, fought another religion, Brahmanism, for centuries on end without even being able to say what made Brahmanism into a religion?\nSimilar considerations hold good elsewhere. Despite the presence of the voluminous Subhashita and Dharmashastra literatures, India has hardly produced noticeable tracts and sustained reflections on \u0026rsquo;ethics\u0026rsquo;. There is no equivalent of an \u0026lsquo;Ethica Nichomachea\u0026rsquo;, let alone a \u0026lsquo;Summa Theologica\u0026rsquo; in the Indian intellectual traditions. This does not mean that there is no evidence for intellectual reflections; on the contrary. Yet, certain kinds of reflections are noticeable for their absence.\nOne such example is the famous \u0026lsquo;Indian caste system\u0026rsquo;.We are assured that the Indian social structure is synonymous with \u0026rsquo;the caste system\u0026rsquo; and all we have by way of an explanation (or even justification) of this system are a few verses: in the Purusha Sukta, in the Gita and in some Dharmashastras. No Indian could tell you the \u0026lsquo;principles\u0026rsquo; of this system, even though quite a few modern \u0026rsquo;theories\u0026rsquo; about it float around. Sociologists, anthropologists, political theorists have provided all kinds of descriptions without being sure of the kind of system that \u0026rsquo;the caste system\u0026rsquo; is supposed to be.\nThe Absence of Intellectual Reflection\nIn this sense, we notice two kinds of facts when we try to study Indian culture. First, there is a noticeable absence of intellectual reflection on these and allied phenomena; second, in the course of the last three hundred years or so, Indian intellectuals have merely reproduced western descriptions of the Indian culture and her traditions. When we study India, our question should then be: why is there such a vacuum? It requires noting that this question cannot be answered by appealing to other \u0026rsquo;negative facts\u0026rsquo;, for example, the contention that Indian culture did not have \u0026lsquo;sciences.\u0026rsquo; We need to appeal to what exists in the world in order to explain what does not.\nLet me make this general point in a more concrete way. Consider the kind of questions that people in the West routinely ask today: Why do the Hindus wear bindi? Why do Indians not eat beef? Is it true that the most Indians worship the phallus? What do Indians think about the caste-system? Do they still practice Sati in India? Why do Indian gods have six or eight arms? What is the Hindu religious symbol? Do most Indians worship statues in temples? Do the Buddhists believe in God? Are Hindus religious? And so on and so forth.\nConsider now the fact that most Indians do not ask these questions in their process of socialization. Why are these questions not raised there? I mean to say, why do they not go around asking questions about eating beef, wearing bindi, worshipping the Shiva Linga, and such like in India? Why have people not found it important to write huge tracts about such practices? Surely, it is not because they know the answers to these questions: if they did, they would have no problem in providing the same answers to the western interlocutors. Here is a simple but a very important answer: it does not occur to most Indians to raise these questions about their traditions. It does not occur to them not because they are any less curious or intelligent than people in the western culture but because such questions do not make sense in their cultural milieu. That is to say, they learn not to ask such questions about their tradition because they are learning to become conversant with the Indian tradition. Of course, when I say that they do not ask such questions, it does not mean that they have never raised these questions at any point in their lives: for instance, as children they too would have raised many such questions, and the answers have satisfied them. Such answers would (mostly) refer to the nature of their inherited practices.\nWhen Indians confront such questions in the West, two things happen: (a) they feel compelled to provide an answer; (b) the answers they give very closely track the answers already provided by Westerners. That is to say, when such questions are asked of those practicing Indian traditions, one should not assume that these questions are intelligible to these Indians; they are not. It is in the nature of the western culture to encourage such questions to be raised. Furthermore, such questions also outline the kind of answers that are admissible.\nOne of the most important consequences of my claim is this: when the western culture quizzes Indians about the nature of their traditions, this culture is telling us about itself. To provide answers to the western interlocutors about Indian traditions one needs to understand the nature of western culture. Simply put: to understand let alone answer such questions about the Indian traditions, one has to understand the western culture.\nCross-Cultural Asymmetry\nIn other words, we face an asymmetry. To study and understand western culture, we need to study what it says about the others and itself. However, we need to do exactly the same thing even when we want to study Indian culture. Alternately put, we compare the western descriptions (of itself and the others) to understand the West; if we want to understand India, we have to begin by saying why (and in what sense) India is not like the West. Our expectation of wanting to study India by looking at what it says about itself and the others is not met. Nor could we simply continue with the so-called \u0026rsquo;empirical\u0026rsquo; and/or \u0026rsquo;textual\u0026rsquo; studies to understand Indian culture because, in this process, we will merely add to the western descriptions of India and not advance our understanding of the Indian culture.\nWhy is there such an asymmetry? It has to do with what colonialism is also about: establishing frameworks of inquiry into the nature of human beings and societies through the use of power and violence (S. N. Balagangadhara et al., 2008). Once established and generalized, such frameworks continue to draw their legitimacy through sources other than those that are cognitive in nature. Today, it appears to me, this legitimizing process has reached its apotheosis in the guise of an attitude that suggests that a science of culture and the sciences of the social are simply impossible because of human and epistemic limitations. Needless to say, a persistent \u0026lsquo;anti-scientific\u0026rsquo; attitude adds fodder to such an attitude.\nI believe that it is possible to develop a science of culture that is in every way as scientific as physics or biology. However, we shall not get there unless we realize that our road will be comparative in nature: study the West in a comparative way and study other cultures to isolate their differentia specifica from the West. They will be two different types of comparison but they will give us what we lack and so badly need today: knowledge of human beings in their societies and cultures.\nReferences\nS . N .

Concomitantly, American identity politics and European political correctness is also \u0026ldquo;forcing\u0026rdquo; minority communities to assert their separate \u0026ldquo;churches\u0026rdquo;, as a way of emphasising their own distinct religious or ethnic identity.\nLast November, the Royal Mail of the United Kingdom agreed to avoid distributing a stamp which depicted a 17th century painting of an Indian pair revering the infant Jesus. The 68 pence Christmas stamp had provoked calls for its withdrawal by local Hindu organisations, because it featured \u0026ldquo;a picture of Hindus worshipping Baby Christ\u0026rdquo;. This event is not as insignificant as it may seem. It symbolises a dramatic change in self-image for Hindu traditions – a tragic decline, advocates of pluralism would say.\nThe sensibilities of most westerners would be awestruck at the tremendous variety of traditions, practices and stories which one encounters all over India. Even more so they would marvel at the consistent intermingling of these traditions in different regions: Hindu families praising the infant Jesus in the Bangalore newspapers; Muslims joining the celebration of Hindu festivals and Hindus funding the construction of mosques in Karnataka; \u0026lsquo;dargahs\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;pirs\u0026rsquo; being shared by different communities everywhere; Buddhism and Hinduism often being impossible to tell apart in Kinnaur; Hindu ladies kneeling to say a few \u0026ldquo;Hail Marys\u0026rdquo; in the Velankanni area; pictures of Ganesha, Mother Mary, Shirdi Sai Baba and E V R Periyar in the same room. The list is as endless as it is colourful. Of course, conflicts have emerged in India as elsewhere. But human diversity has perhaps nowhere flourished as it has here.\nFor ages, Hindus have celebrated this fact as an expression of the beauty of their culture. They have contrasted their own broad-minded indifference towards a variety of divergent practices and usages that Hindu tradition has found with the inflammatory dogmatism of Christians and Muslims. The British stamp incident stands in stark contrast to this long prevailing Indian attitude. As a local Hindu spokesman puts it: \u0026ldquo;Even if we accept that an artist in 1620 AD took the artistic licence to portray practising Hindus worshipping the baby Christ, we should be asking if this is politically and sensitively correct in the 21st century.\u0026rdquo; Certainly, something has changed between the 17th and the 21st centuries. This is not an isolated incident. Its counterparts are not confined to the UK. Globally, Hindus are becoming increasingly sensitive about the portrayal of their traditions. But what exactly is happening to the Hindu traditions in the west?\nLet us have a look at a few striking cases to assess the nature of this development. Both in India and the west, Hindu organisations have expressed outrage at the trendy depiction of Hindu deities on bikinis, slippers and other items. In India, paintings of Saraswati and other deities in the nude have provoked riots. Recently, some Hindus were shocked by an American textbook calling Kali and Durga bloodthirsty. A third-rate psychoanalysis of Ganesha by an American scholar enraged the NRI community in the US. Many Bengalis, one tells me, these days decently dress up the earlier naked statuettes of goddesses before \u0026lsquo;puja\u0026rsquo;. No doubt some of these representations of the \u0026lsquo;devatas\u0026rsquo; are in bad taste. A few are downright derogatory. But the reaction itself is more disquieting. It not only tends to deny the traditional character and depiction of Hindu deities – who often are bloodthirsty, playful, capricious, sensual, cruel, mischievous…; it also threatens to obliterate the sophisticated eroticism that also exists as part of these beautiful traditions. What is next? Are we to deny that Krishna seduced \u0026ldquo;16,000 gopis\u0026rdquo;? Denounce Khajuraho, the Kama Sutra and the Koka Shastra as aberrations alien to the true Indian civilisation? Perhaps we could even rewrite the songs glorifying the love between Radha and Krishna, Shiva and Parvati and recast the diverse devatas in a form that suits middle class morality?\nThese issues lose some of their weight, once we turn to the massive controversies and pamphlet wars presently raging in academia and beyond. Most of these incidents have particularly agitated the NRI community. Several NRI sponsored or organised foundations have launched campaigns to end the negative portrayal of Hinduism in American education. Many points of the critique are valid. The textbook descriptions of the Hindu religion carry a bias that reminds one of the Christian harangues against \u0026ldquo;the evil religion of the Hindoos\u0026rdquo;. Scholarly studies of the Hindu traditions often reproduce the judgments of European missionaries and colonials. Rarely does contemporary research on Indian society go beyond the colonial framework of previous centuries. Hence, we cannot but take seriously the impression that something is very wrong with the way in which the Indian culture has been described in the west (and, by connivance, in the Indian universities).\nAn \u0026lsquo;Alternate\u0026rsquo; Hinduism\nYet, trouble rears its head once we take a step further. What is the alternative? How would these critics of the academia propose to go about studying the Hindu traditions? Usually, worn-out discussions about insider vs outsider perspectives dictate the responses. The negative stereotypes, it is suggested, will disappear once the insider perspective of Hinduism is given its rightful place in the academia. Is this really so? A recent case illustrates well what happens when the issue is made into one of \u0026ldquo;Hindus should speak for Hinduism\u0026rdquo;, i e, the California textbook controversy. In this case, two prominent Hindu foundations suggested improvements in sections of the California state textbooks concerning India and Hinduism. After the adoption of these \u0026ldquo;edits\u0026rdquo;, a conflict erupted between a group of Indian scholars and Hindu spokesmen, calling each other Hindu haters and Hindutva fundamentalists respectively. These polemics are of no avail here. It is the \u0026ldquo;alternate\u0026rdquo; view of Hinduism offered that concerns us.\nMany of the corrections by one of the foundations, the Hindu Education Foundation, are reasonable, but hardly constitute an alternative portrayal. The Aryan invasion, it says, should be presented as hypothesis rather than fact. So far so good. A disquiet sets in when we come to the recommendations of the second foundation, the Vedic Foundation. Here is a different portrayal indeed. Firstly, wherever the textbooks say Hindu \u0026ldquo;stories\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;writings\u0026rdquo;, it wants Hindu \u0026ldquo;scriptures\u0026rdquo;. This may seem innocent, however, it transforms the Hindu traditions with their vast array of rich and complex stories, told and retold in many different ways, into a rigid body of canonical \u0026ldquo;scriptures\u0026rdquo; – much like Christianity or Islam. Consequently, these \u0026ldquo;scriptures\u0026rdquo; require protection, because they are no longer stories, but sacred doctrines.\nSecondly, where the textbooks discuss \u0026ldquo;enlightenment\u0026rdquo; and the \u0026ldquo;enlightened\u0026rdquo; in the Hindu traditions, the Foundation wants these substituted with \u0026ldquo;god realisation\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;god realised\u0026rdquo;. \u0026ldquo;Brahman\u0026rdquo; too has been systematically replaced by \u0026ldquo;god\u0026rdquo;. Again, the implications go beyond mere words. Hindu tradition and its notions of Basrahman and enlightenment are not in any way related to anything like the god of Christianity – who is believed to be a person without a body who created and governs the universe, but exists outside it. Thirdly, it gets even worse when this Foundation denies that the Hindu traditions revolve around \u0026ldquo;multiple gods\u0026rdquo; and reverence towards these various gods. No, they claim, these many deities are in fact one god or at most various forms of god. Ancient Hindus did not go to temples to \u0026ldquo;connect with their gods\u0026rdquo;, but to \u0026ldquo;worship god\u0026rdquo;. Again, when American children and adults read god in the textbooks, they will obviously understand the Christian god and not something like brahman in the Hindu traditions. In fact, when one uses \u0026ldquo;god\u0026rdquo; in English, the one possible referent is the Judeo-Christian god – the creator and sovereign of the universe who demands from humanity perfect obedience to his will and exclusive worship of himself. In effect, the proposal of the Vedic Foundation makes this Christian god the main focus of Hinduism.\nIt seems these American Hindus have become ashamed of the Hindu traditions as they have existed for centuries in India. Here, one can select Ganesha as one\u0026rsquo;s \u0026lsquo;ishta-devata\u0026rsquo;, without acknowledging any one god whom he is supposed to embody. One can do puja to a variety of deities every day, while being unaware of some independent entity called god. One can strive for \u0026lsquo;adhyatmic\u0026rsquo; enlightenment, but deny the existence of any god. One can live in complete ignorance of the Hindu \u0026ldquo;scriptures\u0026rdquo; and still be a good Hindu. One can tell one\u0026rsquo;s children the many stories explaining Ganesha\u0026rsquo;s broken tusk or Krishna\u0026rsquo;s love for ghee and invent a few new ones. According to the image of the Vedic Foundation, such Hindus – the majority of the Indian population – are all ignorant of true Hinduism, its scriptures and its god. Basically, this group is sanitising the Hindu traditions into a proper religion according to Judeo-Christian standards. It is neither continuing the traditions as passed on by the Indian ancestors nor critically reflecting upon them. Instead, it is transforming Hindu tradition into a second-hand Christianity.\nAdmittedly, this is an extreme case, but it illustrates a general tendency. The case of the 68p Christmas stamp comes back to mind. It shows that British Hindus feel a similar need to make Hinduism into a proper religion, with its own inviolable teachings and sacrosanct sensitivities – parallel to those of Muslims, Jews and Christians. Similar incidents have occurred in the recent past. A transformation is taking place in the representation of the Hindu traditions, to be sure. But where does it come from and is it a change for the good?\nThe easy way out is to rebuke an \u0026ldquo;alienated\u0026rdquo; NRI community for its uptight morality, its Hindutva leanings and its anxiety about losing its tradition. One could even lament the saffronisation of education. But such rhetoric will not do. Not all of the people involved are Hindutva fanatics or obscurantist prudes. Probably, the majority is not. As before, it may be the past that will help to understand the problems of the present. In the 19th century, the colonial inferiority complex of certain Hindu reformers inspired a massive attempt to transform native traditions into a Hindu theism – Protestant Christianity dressed up in Hindu garb. Thus, an era of evangelical propaganda and colonial education brought forth its fruits. Are we witnessing a similar dynamic in the 21st century?\nPerhaps, but another factor is involved. These Hindus live in the west and are legitimately challenging its negative stereotypes of India. What we have to understand today is how the dominant framework of western societies compels them to reshape their traditions into a Christian mould while they are doing so. American identity politics and European political correctness seem to force each minority community to assert itself as a separate \u0026ldquo;church\u0026rdquo; with its own distinct religious or ethnic identity. Only in this way do western societies allow the local Hindus to strive for recognition and protection. This makes the conditions understandable, but it does not mitigate the magnitude of the tragedy. The Hindu foundations of today desire to fight the Christian missionary movement, but instead continue its work at an insidious level. They want conversion to be banned in India. In the meantime, they are themselves converting the Hindu traditions into a variant of Christianity.\n","tags":[],"title":"Courting controversy in the West","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/courting-controversy-in-the-west/"},{"categories":["epw","Jakob","published","secularism"],"content":"A text like my article on the secularism debate (EPW, September 28, 2002), is something more than a sequence of sentences. This is a scientific text, which builds an argument. Therefore, the different sentences have different status according to their function in the argument. Some are premises, and others state the conclusions that follow from these. Some sentences illustrate the point made, yet others provide evidence. To understand such a text, one has to grasp the logical relations between these different sentences.\nThroughout his \u0026lsquo;critique\u0026rsquo; Kushal Deb (EPW, October 26, 2002) isolates some sentences from my article, and misinterprets them without showing an awareness of their place in the larger argumentative pattern. One example should do. While pointing out a few of my \u0026lsquo;ridiculous\u0026rsquo; assertions, he says the following: \u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip; at one point he even claims that policies of the state such as charity, protection of the weak and the poor, levy of taxes to secure distribution of wealth are so deeply influenced by Christianity that no secular state can live up to the demands of secularism.\u0026rdquo; I make a different point altogether. On the one hand, I say, one could argue that any welfare state which engages in charity is inspired by the religious values of Christianity, and that it fails to live up to the demands of secularism. On the other, one could just as easily propose that such policies are not religious at all but are based on common human values, and that such a state is secular. From these premises, I derive the following conclusion: \u0026ldquo;Thus, according to one\u0026rsquo;s personal predilections in attributing the predicate \u0026lsquo;religious\u0026rsquo; to certain values, beliefs, and institutions, one can give various interpretations to the idea of the secular state.\u0026rdquo; Deb seem to miss this point, perhaps because he has read the text as a sequence of isolated sentences.\nDeb\u0026rsquo;s main complaint is that I am obsessed with precise definitions, and that I seem to think that \u0026ldquo;the religious conflicts\u0026rdquo; in India would have been solved if only the Indian scholars had provided precise definitions of \u0026lsquo;secularism\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo;. The problem I identify goes much deeper than the definitional one. To put it very succinctly, the claim of the secularists is that the separation of politics and religion is indispensable in a country like India, where religious strife between Hindus and Muslims prevails. For such a claim to make sense, we should of course be able to recognise religion, that is, we should know the structure of \u0026rsquo;the religious\u0026rsquo; (as in \u0026lsquo;religious\u0026rsquo; beliefs, \u0026lsquo;religious\u0026rsquo; institutions or \u0026lsquo;religious\u0026rsquo; conflicts), which distinguishes it from the non-religious or the secular. The only road that leads to such knowledge is theory formation on the phenomenon of religion. If one assumes that the Hindu traditions and Islam are both religions, one should develop a theory that lays bare the common structure of these cultural traditions, which makes them into religion. In the absence of a consistent and falsifiable theory of religion, the meaning of statements using the word \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo; is dependent on one\u0026rsquo;s personal preferences in defining the word. That is, one can simply draw the line between the religious and the secular where one wants to. Of course, this problem cannot be solved merely by giving a precise definition of \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo;. A definition does not provide us with knowledge of the world. It does not have any empirical consequences, it cannot be tested, and thus it is \u0026lsquo;arbitrary\u0026rsquo;. Now, since the Indian secularists do not provide any theoretical explanation that tells us what makes the Hindu traditions and Islam into religions or what makes the Hindu-Muslim problem into a religious conflict, their claims about the separation of politics and religion are obscure. Clearly, if this argument reveals an obsession on my part, it is an obsession with theory, which should give us knowledge of the problems of pluralism in contemporary India, and not with some or another definition of \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo;, or \u0026lsquo;secularism\u0026rsquo;, however precise it may be.\nGiven the absence of theory, it is incredible that the language of secularism has today become the sole language in which to reflect on the clashes between – and the peaceful coexistence of – different cultural communities in India. Deb\u0026rsquo;s writing is illustrative in this regard. He makes some matter-of-fact statements about the \u0026ldquo;complex ground realities\u0026rdquo; of the Indian situation (\u0026ldquo;the butchering, raping, and looting of thousands of Muslims in Gujarat;\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;the communal holocausts during partition;\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;the caste inequalities and violence which were a ubiquitous feature of Hinduism\u0026rdquo;) and from these he concludes that India needs secularism to survive. When I deny the latter, and point out that the idea of secularism does not even make sense, he concludes that I must be either ignorant of, or denying the existence of, the horrible conflicts that have taken place in India. It is interesting to note what happens here: Deb is in fact conflating a particular description of certain phenomena (the secularism discourse with its notions of \u0026rsquo;the all-encompassing Hindu religion\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;Hindu-Muslim strife\u0026rsquo;) with these phenomena themselves (the conflicts among different communities in India). That is, he ignores the distinction between a description and the phenomena it describes. Take the example of a stone dropped from a tower. It falls until it hits the ground. Imagine three descriptions of this phenomenon. The first says that the stone falls because it is in love with earth. The second says that the stone falls because objects strive to return to their natural position in the world. The third says that the stone falls because of the gravitational forces acting upon it. In these cases, it is obvious that there is a distinction between the phenomenon of the falling stone, and the descriptions of this phenomenon. The progress in scientific theorising is possible precisely because we are aware of this distinction: if a description does not help us to understand the phenomena in question, we will try to develop a better theoretical description.\nTake the issue of the conflicts and injustices in India. Kushal Deb describes these phenomena in terms of \u0026rsquo;the Hindu religion\u0026rsquo; and the \u0026lsquo;religious conflicts\u0026rsquo;, and claims that secularism is the single solution to the problems involved. Because no alternative descriptions are available, Deb speaks as though unaware of the distinction between description and phenomena. It appears to me as though he simply cannot imagine other ways of talking and thinking about the problem of pluralism in India in a language other than that of secularism. The secularism discourse presupposes that the Hindu-Muslim problem is a religious problem and that secularism is the only solution without developing any falsifiable hypothesis on the conflicts in question, which demonstrates that there is a necessary connection between the structure of these conflicts and the conceptual structure of secularism.\nContrary to what he suggests, I am not questioning the \u0026lsquo;moral right\u0026rsquo; of the Indian secularists to state that religion ought to be separated from politics. What I am questioning, however, is their belief that such normative statements contribute anything to the pursuit of a solution to the growing animosity between Hindus and Muslims. As the bloodshed turns out to be more horrible with every new outburst of conflict, the problem becomes ever more acute. What worries me is that so many of the Indian scholars are wasting their intellectual energies in pontificating about secularism, instead of theorising the Indian situation so that new insights can be gained and new solutions created. As you say, they may well \u0026ldquo;be convinced about the genuineness of the issues that they are striving for,\u0026rdquo; but those personal convictions cannot make good the theoretical poverty and the lack of argument in their stories on secularism. The choice is open. Either you continue to preach in your normative language of secularism – deflecting all challenges as \u0026ldquo;vacuous attempts at secularism bashing\u0026rdquo; – and then you confine yourself to the reproduction of empty mantras. Or you start taking my challenges to the secularism discourse seriously – accepting the basic lessons of logic and philosophy of science – and then I invite you to participate in the fascinating enterprise of building alternative theory that will give us knowledge of the current predicaments of Indian society. If there is a real concern about the tragedies that are taking place in\n","tags":[],"title":"Secularism and Absence of Theory","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/secularism-and-absence-of-theory/"},{"categories":["epw","Jakob","published","secularism"],"content":"On the Indian Debate and Its Western Origins\nThe rise of Hindutva has often been interpreted as a threat to the secular state. Similarly, the recent outbursts of Hindu-Muslim conflict are said to be related to the decay of secularism. The author argues that the concept of secularism is fundamentally obscure, since it is founded upon an arbitrary distinction between the religious and the secular. The belief that religion should be separated from politics is a normative dogma that precedes all theoretical analysis of the Indian situation. Therefore, this concept of secularism prevents us from understanding the problems of pluralism in contemporary India, instead of helping us to solve them.\nSince the declaration of Independence in 1947, the issue of secularism has been at the centre of the struggle between the conservative and progressive forces in Indian society. With the rise of the Hindu Right and the growing intensity of Hindu-Muslim conflict in recent decades, the issue has once again become as urgent as it was in the aftermath of Partition. At least, that is what the secularists tell us. Indian society is characterised by its religious pluralism, they say, and therefore the state should absolutely be secular, that is, it should be impartial towards all religions. According to this view, the problem with the Hindu Right is that it strives to make India into a religious state. If this were done, the state would persistently take the side of the Hindu majority in conflicts between Hindus and Muslims, and it would no longer be able to curb the violence as an impartial arbiter. Shortly, the basic fear of the secularists is that India threatens to fall apart if the domain of politics is not separated from that of religion. It is this view that brings them to sweeping statements such as the following: \u0026ldquo;Secularism, for India, is not simply a point of view, it is a question of survival\u0026rdquo; .\nWhen the Indian intellectuals attach such importance to the idea of secularism, one would expect it to be more or less clear what its content is. However, whenever the participants in the debate attempt to pinpoint what secularism is, they end up in obscurity and confusion. In 1972, Mushir-Ul-Haq made the following remark: \u0026ldquo;For the last two decades Indians have been talking of secularism, yet the term remains vague and ambiguous. One may, therefore, be justified in asking: what does secularism really mean – especially in the Indian context?\u0026rdquo;. Twenty years later, M M Sankhdher came to the same conclusion: \u0026ldquo;Such a commonplace concept as secularism, with which the man in the street is so familiar and so used to, tends to acquire the character of a riddle, a puzzle, an enigma amongst intelligentsia\u0026rdquo; . In the last few decades, similar remarks have surfaced again and again. Some point out \u0026ldquo;the curious absence, the startling and significant vacuity of the notion \u0026lsquo;secularism\u0026rsquo; itself,\u0026rdquo; and go so far as to claim that the notion has become \u0026ldquo;a sort of mantra, a quasi-religious incantation\u0026rdquo; . Others put it mildly and say that there is a tendency among Indian intellectuals to interpret the concept in their own subjective manner , or they use more pointed terms: \u0026ldquo;Like liberal Hindu gods who can take different forms and give a chance to the devotees to worship in any form they like, in India the concept of secularism has acquired so many interpretations and it now means different things to different groups of people\u0026rdquo; . Whether Muslim or Hindu, rightist or leftist, sociologist or philosopher, these thinkers all agree on one point: the term \u0026lsquo;secularism\u0026rsquo; has so many different meanings in the Indian context that it appears to have lost all meaning.\nIn this paper, I will argue that the semantic confusion surrounding \u0026lsquo;secularism\u0026rsquo; masks a number of deeper problems in the Indian debate. Instead of being embedded in a well-structured theory, the idea of secularism consists of a number of isolated normative propositions regarding the relation of politics and religion, which are proclaimed as though they are self-evidently true. First, I will show that these tenets of secularism do not make much sense, because they are based on an arbitrary and unstable distinction between the religious and the secular. The argument continues by demonstrating that this cannot be a problem particular to the Indian context, but that secularism should be as difficult to grasp elsewhere as it is in India. Finally, I will conclude by formulating a question for future research: Why do so many intellectuals remain under the spell of the principle of the separation of politics and religion, while this principle suffers from a basic lack of intelligibility?\nI\nThe Religious and the Secular\nNot all participants in the secularism debate experience difficulties in making sense of the concept around which the debate revolves. Those who intend to protect the secular character of the Indian state from the onslaught of the Hindu Right often provide definitions that appear to leave no doubt as to the meaning of the term. Secularism, they say, requires the separation of the state from religion in general, from all faiths, or from any particular religious order, or it stands for the separation of religious and non-religious institutions . Obviously, when the secularists argue that this kind of secularism is indispensable in India, it is their burden to produce a theoretical description of the Indian situation which demonstrates that the separation of politics and religion is its only conceptual solution.\nAt the very least, any such description has to answer two basic questions. Firstly, it should be able to tell us what the properties of religion are. If there is no theoretical clarity on what makes some phenomena of Indian culture into religious phenomena or some institutions of Indian society into religious institutions, then there is simply no point in stating that the religious ought to be separated from the political. Secondly, the belief that the secular state offers the political answer to the Hindu-Muslim strife in India derives from the underlying belief that it is the one viable solution to the predicament of religious pluralism. For this inference to hold, the description should identify the general properties of religious pluralism, and show that these properties can also be discerned in the Hindu-Muslim problem. In other words, it should describe the structure that distinguishes the predicament of religious pluralism or religious strife from other problems of human co-existence. As the cogency of the secularism discourse is fully dependent on these two issues, I will examine the extent to which they are satisfactorily addressed by some of the prominent advocates of secularism.\nReligion of Secularism\nWhen India became independent, it was obvious to most leaders of the Indian National Congress that it had to become a secular state, because they considered this to be the only form of government that would secure the peaceful co-existence of Hindus and Muslims. This view found one of its strongest proponents in Jawaharlal Nehru, who went so far as to assert that \u0026ldquo;no state can be civilised except a secular state\u0026rdquo; . According to Bipan Chandra, Nehru\u0026rsquo;s definition of secularism was four-pronged:\nSecularism meant first, separation of religion from political, economic, social and cultural aspects of life, religion being treated as a purely personal matter; second, dissociation of the state from religion; third, full freedom to all religions and tolerance of all religions; and four, equal opportunities for followers of all religions, and no discrimination and partiality on grounds of religion .\nPrima facie, this may appear to be a precise definition. However, when one is aware of the confusion surrounding the concept of religion, its obscurity becomes baffling. For instance, it is often said that religion in India is simply a way of life; and Durkheim\u0026rsquo;s approach defines religion as a unified system of beliefs and practices which unite into a single moral community all those who adhere to them. If secularism means the separation of religion from all social aspects of life, and religion is a way of life or a system of social unification, then the former necessarily implies the complete annihilation of religion. At the same time, secularism is supposed to stand for full freedom and tolerance of all religions. Unless one thinks it is possible to reconcile annihilation and tolerance, this shows that Nehruvian secularism becomes inconsistent when it is interpreted in the terms of some common definitions of religion. It turns out to be a scarcely intelligible idea once one tries to give content to loose talk on the separation of religion from the different domains of public life.\nAt times, Nehru seems conscious of the lack of clarity in the concept of religion. Consider the following statement: \u0026ldquo;If religion, or rather what is called religion, in India continues to interfere with everything, then it will not be a mere question of divorcing it from politics, but of divorcing it from life itself\u0026rdquo; . This statement has a rather peculiar form. First, Nehru admits that it is not clear to him what religion is, since he is not sure whether what is called religion in India really is religion. But then he suggests that religion interferes with everything and that it has to be divorced from life itself, as though it is obvious how to recognise religion and distinguish it from other social phenomena. The ambiguity is even more confusing in one of B R Ambedkar\u0026rsquo;s interventions in the Constituent Assembly Debates:\nThe religious conceptions in this country are so vast that they cover every aspect of life from birth to death. There is nothing which is not religion and if personal law is to be saved I am sure about it that in social matters we will come to a standstill…There is nothing extraordinary in saying that we ought to strive hereafter to limit the definition of religion in such a manner that we shall not extend it beyond beliefs and such rituals as may be connected with ceremonials which are essentially religious .\nReligion seems easily identifiable to Ambedkar since he perceives that it covers every aspect of life from birth to death. Naturally, he should be aware that when there is nothing which is not religion, the term loses all meaning. Next, he proposes that political expediency obliges us to limit the definition of religion. Now, how will we find out what is really religion and what not? The extraordinary answer is that we shall define it in terms of beliefs and rituals connected with ceremonials which are essentially religious. When we are still striving to define what religion is, how can we possibly know which things are religious? In this quote, it is painfully clear how arbitrary the statements about Indian religion are. One can feel that \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo; covers every aspect of life in India, and one can at the same time propose that \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo; ought to be limited to those things which one feels are \u0026rsquo;essentially religious\u0026rsquo;. In the absence of a consistent theory of religion, there is no firm cognitive ground for any of these feelings, and one can perpetually continue to invent stipulative definitions according to one\u0026rsquo;s personal intuitions or one\u0026rsquo;s political preferences.\nThe theoretical problems in the secularism discourse will not disappear when the term \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo; is replaced by \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo;, because that strategy confronts us with similar questions as to what Hinduism is, whether it is religion or not, or even whether it exists or not. Nehru himself would certainly admit that these are thorny issues:\nHinduism, as a faith, is vague, amorphous, many-sided, all things to all men. It is hardly possible to define it, or indeed to say whether it is a religion or not in the usual sense of the word. In its present form, and even in the past, it embraces many beliefs and practices, from the highest to the lowest, often opposed to or contradicting each other. Its essential spirit seems to be live and let live .\nIt should be quite impossible to unambiguously identify something which cannot be defined, which is vague, amorphous, many-sided, and all things to all men. And when one does not succeed in identifying the Hindu religion, how can one even dream of separating it from the state or from the public sphere? Surely a serious problem is involved here. As R N Dandekar points out, the social scientific study of Hinduism has long accepted that this religion defies all attempts at definition:\n\u0026hellip;Hinduism does not insist on any particular religious practice as being obligatory, nor does it accept any doctrine as its dogma. Hinduism can also not be identified with a specific moral code. Hinduism, as a religion, does not convey any definite or unitary idea. There is no dogma or practice which can be said to be either universal or essential to Hinduism as a whole .\nBasically, the conclusion is that the Hindu religion does not have any properties – i e, any common beliefs or practices – that allow us to recognise it. This being the case, how shall we determine when an intrusion takes place of this religion into the political domain? When does a state become a Hindu state, as opposed to a secular state? When the government publicly cites Rama as the prototype of the ethical king? Or when it consults an astrologist before making an important political decision? When a puja is done in parliament? Any answer to these and similar questions will be derived from the standard that distinguishes the class of things Hindu from that of things secular. Since there is not the least consensus on such a standard, one can fix it as one chooses, and accordingly one can give one\u0026rsquo;s own interpretation as to what it means for India to be a secular state.\nBesides, if the essential spirit of the Hindu traditions seems to be live and let live, what then is the point of arguing for secularism in India? In the west, such great import was assigned to the separation of church and state because the Christian theocracies had been persecuting states that imposed one specific form of doctrine and worship upon the subjects. Considering that the Hindu traditions do not regard any practice or doctrine as obligatory, it is impossible that contemporary India is confronted with the same threat of a persecuting religious state, and that it is in need of the same safeguard of the secular state. Here, the objection may arise that although it is quite true that Hinduism generally has no difficulty with accommodating all kinds of practices and beliefs, the more dogmatic and intolerant form of Hindutva also exists, and that therefore the Hindu religion should be separated from the state in India. For such an objection to be meaningful, one will have to show what makes the various Hindu traditions into one \u0026lsquo;Hindu religion\u0026rsquo; (or several Hindu religions for that matter), how the religious elements of this religion are present in an excessive form in the discourses and practices of the Hindu Right, and what it would mean to separate these elements from politics. These questions have not even been addressed by the secularists. Thus, one cannot but conclude that they simply presuppose that the present difficulties in Indian politics should be understood in terms of the relation between \u0026rsquo;the religious\u0026rsquo; and \u0026rsquo;the political\u0026rsquo;, while they have no clue as to where to draw the line between these two domains.\nThis one assumption is constitutive of the entire debate. For instance, Amartya Sen (1996: 13-14) argues that the principle of secularism does not require that the state must steer clear of any association with any religious matter whatsoever: \u0026ldquo;Rather, what is needed is to ensure that in so far as the state has to deal with different religions and members of different religious communities, there must be a basic symmetry of treatment.\u0026rdquo; The virtue of this approach, he emphasises, is that the requirement of symmetric treatment leaves open the question as to what form that symmetry should take. Two imaginary examples are sufficient to assess the consequences of Sen\u0026rsquo;s liberality. The first is that of some predominantly Muslim state, which allows freedom of religion to the minorities, but also proclaims that all women should wear full burqa. The second example asks us to imagine a time in the future at which the Indian state enacts a law that forbids the consumption of meat to all citizens. Both states are still politically secular according to Sen\u0026rsquo;s principle, since they treat the members of different religious communities in a symmetric manner. Of course, he may object to these counter-intuitive examples of secularism by pointing out that these states do not really respect the principle of symmetry because they impose the religious values or beliefs of the majority on the other communities. To make the latter point convincing, however, Sen should show that matters of dress and diet are part of the religion of the respective majorities. The validity of such an argument is dependent on including these domains of life in some definition of religion, and therefore the states in question could argue as convincingly that their measures are not related to religion in any way – provided they have another definition of religion.\nThus, Sen\u0026rsquo;s formula of \u0026ldquo;basic symmetry of treatment\u0026rdquo; once again illustrates that the theoretical inadequacy of the secularism discourse is largely due to the lack of stability in the essential conceptual distinction between the religious and the secular. The resulting equivocation is not limited to the academic debates. Perhaps, its consequences are best illustrated when the Indian judiciary arbitrarily invokes a number of differing definitions of Hinduism and religion to decide whether a certain community belongs to the religion of Hinduism , or whether Hindutva is a religion or a non-religious way of life . As I said earlier, the principle of the separation of politics and religion is intelligible only if one provides a consistent theoretical description that clarifies what religion is and what makes the various traditions of the subcontinent into religion. These issues being as opaque as they are, the idea of secularism was bound to become an empty mantra, and such a mantra will certainly fail to counter the dynamics that are currently disrupting Indian society.\nPredicament of Religious Strife\nIt is not that no attempts at all have been undertaken to theorise the conflicts among the cultural communities in India. In fact, a specific terminology has been coined to study these conflicts, namely, that of \u0026lsquo;communalism\u0026rsquo; and its cognates such as \u0026lsquo;communal violence\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;communal riots\u0026rsquo;. What is this phenomenon of communalism? Nehru defined it as \u0026ldquo;a narrow group mentality basing itself on religious community but in reality concerned with political power and patronage for the group concerned,\u0026rdquo; or, more bitterly, as \u0026ldquo;politics under some religious garb, one religious group being incited to hate another religious group\u0026rdquo; . In a series of essays, Bipan Chandra has argued that communalism should be understood as an ideology which connects religious identities with secular interests, and which suggests that the secular interests of the followers of different religions are opposed to one another (e g, Cahndra 1994:148-49]. Both Nehru and Chandra argue that the problem is not so much religion itself or even the existence of various religious communities, but that it lies in the fact that the religion of these communities is being used to pursue secular interests in the political domain.\nLet us try to illustrate this account of communalism with an example. Imagine a leader of the Jain community who encourages his followers to offer non-violent resistance to British rule in the colonial era, or one who does the same towards the campaigns of the Hindu Right today. Arguably, both leaders use religion (Jain ahimsa) to pursue political interests, and their position implies that these political interests are opposed either to those of the Christian colonials, or to those of the Hindu rightists. Thus the position fulfils the conditions to be called communalism. However, I think Nehru, Chandra, and most other secularists would not like to condemn these acts as instances of communalism in the same way they would condemn the case of Hindutva leaders who incite their followers to destroy a mosque. One can think of many other examples which throw doubt on the above explanation of communalism. The explanation is not useful because it is based on the invalid assumption that one knows what constitutes secular as against religious interests. Does Gandhian non-violence imply the pursuit of a secular interest, a religious interest, or that of a secular interest tied to a religious identity? The communalism account should allow us to answer such questions. Since it does not, it has its own conceptual foundation collapse, and it loses all credibility as an explanation of the negative role of community in Indian politics. Rather than being the conclusion of a careful analysis of this issue, the normative view that religion ought not to be used to pursue secular interests is the pre-theoretical assumption the account starts from.\nIt is often asserted that the most distinctive property of Indian secularism is its firm opposition to communalism. Secularism then is explicitly presented as the ultimate ideological answer to the communal tensions between Hindus and Muslims. Now, as I said, any description of the Hindu-Muslim conflict which is to prove that secularism is necessary in India, should discern the structure of the class of conflicts that can be resolved through secularism, and show the necessary connection between this structure and that of the latter concept. The account of communalism does certainly not offer such a description. When we remove its untenable distinction between secular and religious interests, all it says is that there are different communities which come into conflict because they have (or believe they have) differing interests. Of course, this is a description that can be applied to any and every conflict between two groups of people. Adding the terminology of religion gives us the impression that we are describing a specific kind of conflict; that we are referring to a specific category of conflicts that should be analysed and solved in the same manner. This would be the case if we demonstrated that the conflicts between Hindus and Muslims in contemporary India, those between Protestants and Catholics in early modern Europe, and all the other conflicts we care to designate as religious conflicts share a common structure that makes them into religious conflicts. But the predicate \u0026lsquo;religious\u0026rsquo; does not refer to such a common structure in the phenomena it intends to describe; rather it appears to be a self-explanatory tag which generates the illusion that we have a deeper understanding of these phenomena. So even if Nehru wrote in 1936 that \u0026ldquo;the communal problem is not a religious problem, it has almost nothing to do with religion,\u0026rdquo; and even if some contemporary thinkers agree that the communal riots do not revolve around religion, such claims do not explain anything about the conflicts among the various communities in Indian society as long as one does not provide theoretical criteria to distinguish religious problems from those that have nothing to do with religion .\nIf one does not possess such criteria, any argument one constructs in order to demonstrate that secularism is the sole answer to India\u0026rsquo;s predicament of \u0026lsquo;religious strife\u0026rsquo; is bound to end up in a conceptual muddle. This is well illustrated by the work of the political theorist Rajeev Bhargava. The case for secularism is \u0026lsquo;overdetermined\u0026rsquo;, Bhargava believes, since the reasons in favour of the idea are \u0026lsquo;overwhelming\u0026rsquo; . Of these reasons, he considers \u0026ldquo;the argument from ordinary life\u0026rdquo; to be the most convincing. This argument begins with the assertion that religious world-views are constituted by ultimate ideals. When the believers of different religions and non-believers have to live together, a clash of their ultimate ideals is always imminent. A clash of such ideals could deprive people of leading an ordinary life. Since it is the state\u0026rsquo;s task to secure a minimally decent existence for its citizens, all ultimate ideals must be expunged from the affairs of the state. Therefore, politics and religion have to be separated, the two domains have to keep a principled distance and respect each other\u0026rsquo;s boundaries. \u0026lsquo;To sum up\u0026rsquo;, Bhargava says, \u0026ldquo;ordinary life requires that an acceptable minimum standard exists and that it is barbaric to fall below it,\u0026rdquo; and political secularism is the only way to secure this minimum standard and to avoid barbarism .\nUnderlying this argument from ordinary life is a view of the common predicament with which human societies are generally confronted. Both in the west and in India, Bhargava suggests, secularism was consolidated in the face of irresolvable religious conflicts and in the aftermath of sectarian violence. More generally, he concludes that \u0026ldquo;whenever conflicts became uncontainable and insufferable, something resembling a politically secular state simply had to emerge\u0026rdquo; . This simply had to happen because of the following reason:\nAt no point in the history of humankind has any society existed with one and only one set of ultimate ideals. Moreover, many of these ultimate ideals or particular formulations of these have conflicted with one another. In such times, humanity has either got caught in an escalating spiral of violence and cruelty or come to the realisation that even ultimate ideals need to be delimited. In short, it has recurrently stumbled upon something resembling political secularism. Political secularism must then be seen as a part of the family of views which arises in response to a fundamental human predicament. It is neither purely Christian nor peculiarly Western. It grows wherever there is a persistent clash of ultimate ideals perceived to be incompatible .\nAlthough there is some ambiguity in this passage (societies have to develop political secularism itself or \u0026lsquo;something similar\u0026rsquo; that belongs to the same \u0026lsquo;family of views\u0026rsquo;), Bhargava does not really waver from his main point: all cultures and societies are confronted with one and the same fundamental human predicament and secularism is the answer to this predicament.\nWhen Bhargava claims that the secular state has to emerge whenever conflicts become uncontainable and insufferable, he cannot possibly mean all conflicts since this would imply that even fights between family members, lovers, or neighbours have secularism as their solution. He is referring to conflicts between groups holding divergent religions, and he defines these conflicts in terms of the distinctive property of \u0026ldquo;a persistent clash of ultimate ideals.\u0026rdquo; This, of course, is a rather vague notion and the author never comes to explaining what makes an ideal into an ultimate ideal. Personally, I do not see why a gang-war between Latinos and Blacks somewhere in LA, a battle between the hooligans of two rival soccer teams somewhere in Europe, a separatist struggle of an ethnic minority anywhere in the world, and literally thousands of other conflicts should not fall under this heading of a clash of ultimate ideals. It sounds slightly absurd if one claims that the secular state is the solution to all of these conflicts. Still, in Bhargava\u0026rsquo;s account, whenever some kind of a compromise emerges between the conflicting parties, this would have to be understood as an instance of humanity solving \u0026ldquo;the fundamental human predicament\u0026rdquo; by stumbling upon \u0026ldquo;something resembling political secularism\u0026rdquo;.\nBhargava is so keen on proving the universal scope of the idea of secularism, that he presents it as the indispensable solution to the human predicament of religious strife. Since he begins with the assumption that this predicament is a universal phenomenon of human societies, he does never really pose the question as to what properties make a conflict into a religious conflict. The consequence is that he takes recourse to some all-encompassing category – \u0026lsquo;clash of ultimate ideals\u0026rsquo; – which cannot possibly refer to a well-defined set of conflicts with significant structural similarities. The same is true for the resulting notion of political secularism: if all non-violent compromises that prevent barbarism between groups holding different \u0026lsquo;ultimate ideals\u0026rsquo; are termed \u0026lsquo;secularism\u0026rsquo;, the term becomes so all-encompassing that it loses its meaning. Thus, Bhargava\u0026rsquo;s argument from ordinary life is no more than a tautology: he wants to give secularism its due simply by stating that all peaceful and civilised pluralism in human societies is due to secularism.\nAt this point, we can come back to the confusion surrounding the idea of secularism among the Indian intellectuals. Fundamentally, this confusion is caused by the utter lack of theoretical clarity in the religious-secular distinction. On top of that, the vacuous term of \u0026lsquo;secularism\u0026rsquo; has grown to be the keyword in Indian political discourse to refer to any kind of situation in which different groups of people live together: if they get along well, this is because of secularism; if they fight and kill each other, they are in need of the antidote of secularism. Anything that allows different kinds of people to live together can be called secularism, and thus the notion has become as vague as it possibly could: it is defined as \u0026ldquo;a state of mind, almost and instinctive feeling, such as existed, by and large, for many centuries in India, when Hindus, Muslims, Christians, Parsis and followers of other faiths lived side by side in general harmony\u0026rdquo; , or as \u0026ldquo;a respect for differences cutting across class, caste, community, and gender, in which religion is a component in the shaping of identity but not the determining criterion\u0026rdquo; . Instead of examining and theorising the ways in which the different cultural groups have succeeded or failed to live together peacefully, we automatically take recourse to this obscure concept of secularism to discuss these matters. Consequently, the secularism discourse prevents us from understanding the problems of pluralism in India, instead of helping us to solve them. The urgency of these problems today makes it all the more painful that the idea prevails that they can be dealt with by endlessly repeating that the religious should be separated from the political.\nII\nThe Misfortune of Separation\nThe tenets of secularism have their origins in the liberal-democratic principle of the separation of church and state. Although this principle originally referred to the specifically Christian conception of the church, liberal theorists today use it to designate the separation of the state and religious institutions of any character, and thereby they aspire to give the principle a universal scope, since the assumption is that religious institutions are present in any society . Thus, in the contemporary western debate, \u0026rsquo;the separation of church and state\u0026rsquo; amounts to a general political principle, which prescribes that the state should not interfere in religious institutions, and that religious institutions should not interfere in state policy. In this section, I will argue that such normative tenets should be as difficult to grasp in the West as they are in India, since the ambiguity is not confined to \u0026rsquo;the Hindu religion\u0026rsquo;, but it has its roots in the concept of religion itself.\nAnyone slightly familiar with the domain will know that a multitude of definitions awaits the one who tries to find out what religion is. However, let us ignore this lack of consensus for the time being, and consider two definitions of religion that at least possess a prima facie plausibility. In his famous article on the subject, Melford Spiro (1966: 91) writes that any definition of \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo; should include, as a key variable, \u0026ldquo;the belief in superhuman …beings who have power to help or harm men.\u0026rdquo; The second definition of the religious we will consider is that of the anthropologist J Van Baal (1971:3): \u0026ldquo;ll explicit and implicit notions and ideas, accepted as true, which relate to a reality which cannot be verified empirically.\u0026rdquo; First of all, we should note that we end up with extremely puzzling propositions when we explain the separation of state and religion in terms of these definitions. What could it possibly mean to say that the state should be separated from the belief in superhuman beings who can help or harm men, or from all notions and ideas that cannot be verified empirically?\nSecondly, as S N Balagangadhara (1994:276f) has argued, disputes about the definition of religion are as endless and meaningless as disputes about taste, since one cannot provide counter-examples to a definition. Let us say that I defend the principles of the secular state in terms of Van Baal\u0026rsquo;s definition, and that you want to demonstrate that I am mistaken. \u0026lsquo;Well\u0026rsquo;, you might point, \u0026ldquo;in the contemporary research of theoretical physics many notions and ideas relate to a reality that cannot be verified empirically at present, while they are certainly accepted as true, so do you mean to say that the state should not interfere in any institution that engages in such research?\u0026rdquo; I might reply that, according to my definition, such research is a kind of religion, and that therefore the secular state should indeed have nothing to do with it. Even if you insist that theoretical physics cannot possibly be a brand of religion, I can always reply that it all depends on one\u0026rsquo;s definition of religion. Now, there are hundreds of such definitions of religion. Each of these will fill in the idea of the secular state in a different manner, and each interpretation will seem as (im)plausible as all the others. Therefore, the debates on the notion of the secular state will necessarily be as endless and arbitrary as the disputes on the definition of religion.\nNaturally, religion may also be a concept embedded in a larger theoretical framework that could enable us to spell out more or less clearly what it means to separate religion from the state. Even if there were different hypotheses on the structure of religion, all of these could be tested empirically and compared in terms of their cognitive productivity. Unlike the barren clash of stipulative definitions, this theoretical competition could result in a fertile confrontation of the notions of secularism that derive from the competing theories of religion. Regrettably, such a theoretical framework is not available, since theory formation on religion has taken the form of ad hoc speculation regarding its origin in human beings or societies. Balagangadhara (1994: ch 5) has shown that all the explanations of religion have the same deficient structure: first they presuppose the truth of the pre-theoretical claim that religion is a cultural universal, and consequently they produce an arbitrary account that speculates as to why this universal phenomenon of religion has come into being. A well known example is Hume\u0026rsquo;s fear-theory of religion: religion arises because man strives to reduce his fear of the natural chaos by ordering and explaining the facts of nature through the postulation of divine beings. It is clear that such an account cannot help us in understanding secularism; it does not make sense to argue for the separation of the state from some fear-reducing mechanism which all human cultures are supposed to share. More generally, the ad hoc explanations regarding the origin of religion do not enable us to distinguish the structure of religion from that of other phenomena, and therefore they cannot solve our problem.\nWhen there is no agreement on the concept of religion, there will also be divergent opinions when it comes to the identification of religious institutions, practices, or beliefs. This consequence can be illustrated by the example of policies of \u0026lsquo;charity\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;protection of the weak and the poor\u0026rsquo;. One could easily argue that any state which engages in such policies is inspired by the religious values of the Christian church. Or one could go even further and claim that a state which levies taxes to secure a redistribution of wealth is so deeply influenced by Christianity that it imposes this religion\u0026rsquo;s doctrines upon its citizens. In fact, why could it not be true that the welfare state which embodies these policies is itself a religious institution based on Christian beliefs and values? The conclusion of this argument would be that any welfare state could not live up to the demands of secularism. Naturally, one could just as well propose that the underlying values are not religiously inspired since they are propounded by many different ethical systems and even by atheists. Thus, according to one\u0026rsquo;s predilections in attributing the predicate \u0026lsquo;religious\u0026rsquo; to certain values, beliefs, and institutions, one can give various interpretations to the idea of the secular state. To sum up, as a general principle of political theory, the separation of politics and religion prescribes the impossible, since there is no theoretical consensus on what religion is and how to distinguish it from other phenomena.\nNevertheless, the nation-states of Europe and North America appear to have been quite successful at solving the problem of the peaceful accommodation of different Christian groups in one political community, and this success is often linked to the belief that they are secular states. When we have a look at the history of this issue, it becomes clear that the accommodation between the majority and the minority communities in the different European countries has come into being through a series of specific treaties and acts. That is, the dominant Christian confession and the minorities have reached a consensus with regards to the freedom of the latter to engage in a specific set of practices without risking persecution by the state. Similarly, in the US, a number of Protestant churches have at some point agreed not to let the differences among their beliefs and practices lead to political persecution or discrimination by creating a state which is constitutionally neutral with regards to these specific confessional differences. Three points have to be emphasised. First, both in Europe and the US, the consensus has never been about the meaning of terms such as \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;religious institution\u0026rsquo;, rather it merely implies that members of some (majority) community have agreed not to persecute a number of other communities because they have certain practices or beliefs. Second, when these states are confronted with new groups, which were not part of the original consensus, this often leads to severe difficulties in accommodating their practices (e g, the \u0026lsquo;headscarf\u0026rsquo; issue in several European countries). And third, in most European countries, the Christian church that has been historically dominant still has a privileged political status; and in the US, the same is true for the original blend of Protestant churches. Therefore, the particular developments in the western nation-states should not be thought of as the rise of an all-encompassing principle of the separation of politics and religion. In fact, the \u0026lsquo;secularism\u0026rsquo; which is attributed to these states is to be understood in the specific terms of the historical consensus that has made the peaceful co-existence of a limited number of communities possible, and not in the general terms of some universal political tenet.\nIII\nEnd of Secularism?\nAgain and again, the argument has brought us to the following conclusion: the secularism discourse is condemned to obscurity, because no conceptual tools are available that allow us to distinguish the religious from the non-religious. It does not come as a surprise then that \u0026ldquo;some have begun to believe that we should, in the interest of intellectual clarity, stop using the term altogether\u0026rdquo; . Naturally, our predicament is not confined to one term, but it pertains to the entire language of secularism and its normative propositions concerning the relation of politics and religion. Still, so many intellectuals are deeply convinced that any civilised state ought to be a secular state in which the religious and the political are separated. Therefore, my argument generates the following puzzle: How to explain the persistence of the idea of secularism, while this idea is not intelligible in the first place? Where does this normative dogma of separation come from? As yet, I cannot provide a full-fledged answer to this question, but I will end this paper by pointing out a direction for future research.\nIn the Indian debate, some of the anti-secularists have claimed that secularism is \u0026ldquo;a gift of Christianity,\u0026rdquo; which should not be imposed upon Indian society . The idea, they point out, derives from Protestant doctrine, and therefore it is absurd to prescribe its transfer to non-western societies. I think we should take this insight seriously. In Reformation theology, the old Christian distinction between the spiritual and the temporal became of supreme import. The Reformers claimed that the Christian was not subject to human authority in matters of faith, since no man could mediate in the relation between god and the individual believer. The freedom of the Christian was limited to the spiritual sphere, however, and he still was to obey all laws of the temporal authorities as long as they did not infringe upon his faith. This conception of Christian liberty was dependent on the belief that there is a twofold government over man, which corresponds to his twofold nature of flesh and spirit. As Calvin put it in his Institutes (1559): \u0026ldquo;There are in man, so to speak, two worlds, over which different kings and different laws have authority\u0026rdquo; . The two worlds were conceived of as two kingdoms: the temporal or political kingdom is concerned with the present life of the body, and it is constituted by human laws that regulate the outward behaviour of man; the spiritual kingdom pertains to the life of the soul or the faith of the inner man, and here god is the only king or judge.\nThe distinction between the temporal (or the secular) and the spiritual (or the religious) was made within the Christian tradition, and it was essential to the Protestant understanding of human life. The conceptual frame of Christian doctrine allowed one to identify the boundaries of these two domains. To put it in very simple terms: the sphere of the religious consists of all matters related to the soul and the pursuit of eternal salvation, while the sphere of the secular consists of all matters related to the bodily life in this world. Such an internal distinction makes sense only within a Christian society, where it has reference to a specific set of beliefs regarding the nature and goal of human existence, and to the institutions and practices of everyday life. The same is true for the normative conceptions regarding the separation of the temporal and the religious. Against the background of Protestant thought, the significance of such conceptions was self-evident: since god alone has authority in the religious sphere, the human laws of the secular authorities should never touch this sphere.\nIn the secularism discourse, these conceptions have been severed from the theological frame that gave them significance, and transformed into universal precepts for the government of human societies. The belief that the religious ought always to be separated from the political has not come into being through a theoretical analysis of the predicaments of plural societies; it appears to have been derived from the foundations of Protestant doctrine. We will have to further examine this connection to find out why the notion of secularism has acquired the character of a pre-theoretical normative dogma in the Indian debate. Of course, this proposal for future research generates more questions than it answers. How come Protestant beliefs have been transformed into the tenets of western political theory? Why have the Indian intellectuals adopted these tenets so easily? What has been the role of the British colonials in this process? Even more important than these questions, however, will be that of developing alternative theory on the pluralism of Indian society and the way it can be managed. I hope to have shown that any such endeavour should dispose of the vacuous concept of secularism rather than accept it as a starting point.\nReferences\nAudi, Robert (2000): Religious Commitment and Secular Reason, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge.

However, the mutual understanding between the advocates and the adversaries of conversion has not advanced much. This paper suggests that this is due to the fact that Hindus and Christians refer to two different objects when they discuss \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo;. The traits which the Christians ascribe to religion account for the premium they put on the right to convert, while the traits of the Hindu view of religion explain the opposition to conversion. As the two parties attribute mutually exclusive properties to religion, they encounter difficulties while seeking to make sense of each other\u0026rsquo;s claims about religion and conversion\nReligious conversion has become the subject of passionate debate in contemporary India. From the early 20th century onwards, it has surfaced again and again in the political realm, in the media and in the courts. During the last few decades the dispute has attained a new climax in the plethora of newspapers, journals, and books whose pages have been devoted to the question of conversion. Apparently, a large group of Indians considers this to be an issue of crucial import to the future of their country.\nThe positions in the dispute are clear. On the one hand, there are those who plead for a ban on conversion, because it disturbs the social peace in plural India. This group consists mainly of Hindus. The aversion towards the proselytising drive of Christianity and Islam is widespread among various Hindu groups – from the radical spokesmen of the Sangh parivar to the moderate Gandhians. On the other hand, there are those who argue that conversion is a fundamental human right, which should be protected in any democracy. Generally, the proponents of the right to conversion are Christians and secularists. In spite of the clarity of these two positions, which have remained unchanged throughout the previous century, the debate has not seen significant progress. The discussions are still governed by feelings of mutual incomprehension, unease, and resentment. The participants in the debate seem to agree on one thing only: the gap between the different views on conversion is unbridgeable.\nThere is much to be said in favour of this conclusion, since all attempts to settle the conflict have failed. The Indian Constitution addressed the issue of conversion more than half a century ago. In Article 25, it is stated that \u0026ldquo;all persons are equally entitled to freedom of conscience and the right freely to profess, practise and propagate religion\u0026rdquo;. Soon, it would turn out that this piece of legislation was not able to resolve the problems around conversion in Indian society. In 1954, the Madhya Pradesh state government launched an inquiry into the proselytising activities of foreign missionaries, which resulted in a report that recommended legal restrictions on conversion. In the next decade, the Orissa government endorsed a Freedom of Religion Act that put such recommendations into practice. Other states would follow. Recently, the Tamil Nadu Prohibition of Forcible Conversion of Religion Ordinance added more confusion. The ensuing polemics demonstrated that the question of conversion is still as contentious as it was before.\nThe situation is growing worse today. The encounters between the Hindu traditions and the proselytising religions of Christianity and Islam are more explosive than ever. Little is needed, these days, for hostile feelings to flare up. In recent years, a similar enmity towards the proselytising activities of Christians has surfaced in Sri Lanka. Conversion seems to play a crucial role in these conflicts. Thus, there is an urgent need to understand why so many south Asians are disturbed by the issue of religious conversion. Why has this issue become a bone of contention? As yet, our research does not allow for conclusive answers. However, given the current weight of the issue, we would like to submit some provisional results for consideration.\nReligion and Conversion\nThe current explanations suggest that the cause for the conflict is not to be located in the issue of conversion itself, but in some hidden agenda of the dominant Hindu community. Some say that high caste Hindus fear they will lose their grip on Indian society if more and more members of the lower castes are converted away from Hinduism . Others suggest that the attack on Christian conversion is merely a convenient pretext of the Sangh parivar to support its agenda of Hindu nationalism . These explanations are not supported by an analysis of the debate on conversion. They seem to consider the viewpoints in this debate as side issues in the struggle between the aggressive Hindutva movement on the one hand and the religious minorities, the downtrodden castes, and their secular protectors on the other. At the very least, a genuine explanation of the clash over conversion in contemporary India should give us insight into the viewpoints of the different parties. It should tell us why so many Indians have invested so much time, energy, and emotion in discussing this particular issue.\nAs Sebastian Kim\u0026rsquo;s recent overview (2003) illustrates, the debates of the last 70 years or so have revolved around the same concerns. One of the early 20th century debates on conversion took place when Mahatma Gandhi was interviewed in 1931 by The Hindu about the role of foreign missionaries in independent India of the future. He said he would ask them to withdraw if they engaged in proselytising by means of medical aid and education. His arguments were clear: \u0026ldquo;Every nation\u0026rsquo;s religion is as good as any other. Certainly India\u0026rsquo;s religions are adequate for her people. We need no converting spiritually\u0026rdquo; (Collected Works, Vol XLV: 320). Although Gandhi later pointed out that the reporter had twisted his words, the modifications he made did not change the picture much. His true standpoint, he said, was the following: \u0026ldquo;Every nation considers its own faith to be as good as that of any other. Certainly the great faiths held by the people of India are adequate for her people. India stands in no need of conversions from one faith to another\u0026rdquo; (Young India, April 23, 1931). An American missionary, E Stanley Jones, replied in an open letter to Gandhi. He asserted that – although he agreed that hospitals and schools should not be used to proselytise – it is \u0026ldquo;a fundamental human right and a fundamental human duty\u0026rdquo; to share what one finds precious in the spiritual realm. Opposing Gandhi\u0026rsquo;s claim that every nation\u0026rsquo;s religion is as good as any other, he said that religious truth – like scientific truth – is by its very nature universal. Jones reproached Gandhi for denying Christians the right to share the truth of Christ with others .\nIn the constituent assembly debates (CAD), similar views were expressed during the quarrel regarding the question whether or not Article 25 of the Constitution should grant Indian citizens the right \u0026ldquo;to propagate their religion\u0026rdquo;. The Christian participants had very strong feelings about this matter. They repeatedly asserted that \u0026ldquo;millions of Christians\u0026rdquo; felt passionately about \u0026ldquo;this right to propagate their religion\u0026rdquo; and that it is perhaps \u0026ldquo;the most fundamental of Christian rights\u0026rdquo; . The Hindus involved in this quarrel, on the contrary, did not at all agree that belonging to a religion entailed a right to convert others. Purushottamdas Tandon put it this way: \u0026ldquo;We Congressmen deem it very improper to convert from one to another religion or to take part in such activities and we are not in favour of this\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;it is absolutely futile to be keen on converting others to one\u0026rsquo;s faith\u0026rdquo; . Nevertheless, they agreed to retain the formula about the propagation of religion, because they desired to stay on good terms with the Christian minorities in India. Tandon again: \u0026ldquo;Generally, we, Congressmen, do not think it at all right – I say so frankly – that people should strenuously go about trying to convert peoples of other faiths into their own, but we want to carry our Christian friends with us […]\u0026rdquo; .\nThe debates of the last few decades have been variations on the same theme. On the one hand, there are Christians and secularists who insist that conversion is a fundamental right, which is part of the universal freedom of conscience: \u0026ldquo;The right of an individual to convert to another religion must be considered a universal human right and should be vigorously defended by Christians and other religious leaders. No state, church, or institution should stand in the way of an individual\u0026rsquo;s pursuit of religious truth\u0026rdquo; [Christianity Today 1999:28]. On the other hand, we have Hindus who say that conversion is an act of violence, which violates religious traditions and disrupts families, communities, and society in general: \u0026ldquo;Religious conversion destroys centuries-old communities and incites communal violence. It is violence, and it breeds violence\u0026rdquo; (Swami Dayananda Saraswati 1999). While it is obvious to one party that belonging to a religion implies the need and the right to convert others to that religion, the other party shows nothing but incomprehension towards this professed link between religion and conversion.\nThese different stances bring about confusion. Consider the following interpretation of the constitutional right to propagate religion. In a 1977 Supreme Court judgment, chief justice A N Ray said Article 25 does not grant the right to convert another person to one\u0026rsquo;s own religion. In fact, he continued, \u0026ldquo;there is no fundamental right to convert another person to one\u0026rsquo;s own religion because if a person purposely undertakes the conversion of another person to his religion … that would impinge on the \u0026lsquo;freedom of conscience\u0026rsquo; guaranteed to all the citizens of the country alike\u0026rdquo; . From the very beginning, the Christians had argued that freedom of conscience also implied the freedom to convert: \u0026ldquo;Freedom to believe without freedom to spread that belief is nothing but bondage\u0026rdquo; [Christianity Today1999:28]. Justice Ray, however, thought differently. Religious conversion, to him, is a violation of the freedom of conscience of the Indian citizens. Thus, to one group, freedom of religion means to be free to convert; to the other, it means to be free from conversion.\nWhat is happening in the Indian debate on conversion? The two parties do not seem able to make sense of each other\u0026rsquo;s claims about religion and conversion. The Christians consider it self-evident that conversion lies at the heart of what religion is all about, while the Hindus cannot see how this could possibly be the case. In the words of a participant in an internet discussion on the topic: \u0026ldquo;Indeed this whole notion of conversion seems all wrong to me. What are they converting? Why can\u0026rsquo;t anyone who wants to practise Christian religion do so without converting? I may be asking stupid questions here, but at this moment, the whole premise of conversion strikes me as odd.\u0026rdquo; In this article, we take the first steps towards an explanation of the difficulties the two parties have in making sense of each other\u0026rsquo;s claims. Our tentative hypothesis is that Hindus and Christians are not talking about the same object when they discuss \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo; and its relation to conversion. Religion according to the Hindus is something completely different from what the Christians refer to as religion.\nOn the one hand, we will look at how Christians have attributed certain traits to religion throughout the history of their encounter with the Hindu traditions. These traits explain why, according to the Christian view, belonging to a religion entails the duty and the right to convert others to that religion. On the other hand, we show that Hindus have attributed a different set of properties to religion in their encounter with the Christians. From this perspective, the incomprehension they express towards the professed link between religion and conversion becomes understandable. Finally, we come to the suggestion that Hindus and Christians do not have the same object in mind when talking about religion. If this turns out to be true, the current debate on conversion is predestined to remain the dead end it is today.\nTriumph of the Cross over Idolatry\nFrom the earliest encounters, missionary zeal characterised the way the European Christians approached Hindu traditions. The Portuguese Catholics who conquered the isle of Goa were the first to put the typical Christian stance towards the traditions of the Indian subcontinent into practice. In 1545, King John III of Portugal gave a series of detailed instructions to the governor of Goa about dealing with Indian heathens:\nIn this brief the king orders that neither public nor private \u0026lsquo;idols\u0026rsquo; be tolerated on the island of Goa and that severe punishment must be meted out to those who persist in keeping them. The houses of people suspected of keeping hidden idols are to be searched. Heathen festivals are not to be tolerated and every brahman is to be banished from Goa, Bassein and Diu. Public offices are to be entrusted to neophytes and not to heathens; Christians are to be freed from heavy labour at the port of Goa, such tasks in the future being reserved exclusively for heathens. Portuguese, under pain of severe punishment, are forbidden to sell heathen slaves to Muslims, since heathens are converted more easily to Christianity under the Portuguese and to Islam under Muslim ownership. Revenues previously used for the support of mosques and temples should be diverted to aid in spreading the gospel .\nIn the Portuguese view, the future of the indigenous traditions was clear: these had to be eradicated. The \u0026lsquo;idols\u0026rsquo; could not be tolerated and neither could the heathen festivals. Measures had to be taken to spread the gospel and to promote the conversion of heathens to Christianity. The Christian religion was something to be spread, if not peacefully, then through force. Apparently, there was something deeply wrong with the native traditions, and the only way to right this wrong was to guide the natives into the Christian faith.\nWhat exactly was wrong? To answer this question, let us turn from the Catholic Portuguese to a German Protestant who landed in India a few centuries later. In the early 18th century, the Lutheran missionary Bartholomeus Ziegenbalg composed a pamphlet entitled Abominable Heathenism, which contains a clear formulation of the reasons behind conversion. Originally written in Tamil, this pamphlet was spread in Tamil Nadu in order to convince the local Hindus that their lives were rooted in error. Using the word a-jnana to convey the idea of sin or error, Ziegenbalg told these Hindus the following: \u0026ldquo;We have come to you to save you from a-jnana. … Make a study of the Christian precepts and accept them in faith, and so become the people of God\u0026rdquo; . In the eight chapters of the pamphlet, Ziegenbalg told the heathens how the gospel would save them from their ignorance:\n(i) What is a-jnana? – It is idol-worship and moral perversion according to Rom 1: 21-32. (ii) How a-jnana spread in this world. – It did so because of the devil\u0026rsquo;s deceit and men\u0026rsquo;s guilt and not because of God. (iii) There is much a-jnana in the whole of Tamil Nadu. (iv) How detestable a-jnana is – Because by a-jnana soul and body will be perverted and punished. (v) How God is helping those in a-jnana to be saved. – Jesus Christ took upon himself the burden of a-jnana and delivers from a-jnana saving soul and body. (vi) What the things are which those who wish to be saved from a-jnana have to do – Answer: Scripture reading, realisation and confession of sin, faith in Jesus Christ, asking for baptism with renunciation of a-jnanaand acceptance of the triune God, living in the communion of the Word of God and the Lord\u0026rsquo;s Supper, living a life of witness and suffering and a life of love and justice. (vii) The trials and tribulations which those who give up a-jnana and enter the church experience in the world for the sake of righteousness. (viii) The benefits promised to those who give up *a-jnana,*accept the true religion and stand in the Christian faith unshaken .\nThis summary discloses what type of a phenomenon religion is to a Christian like Ziegenbalg. On the one hand, the false religion of the heathens consists of sin and error. It perverts soul and body. It is the religion of the followers of the devil. The heathens should be saved from this false religion. On the other hand, there is the true religion of the people of God. This Christian faith is a divine gift to humankind. It is the only way to salvation of body and soul. To escape from false religion, the heathens have to turn to God: they have to read the scripture, accept the triune God, confess their sins, have faith in Jesus Christ, etc. In short, they have to give up false religion, \u0026ldquo;accept the true religion and stand in the Christian faith unshaken\u0026rdquo;.\nNaturally, not all Europeans travelling to India in this period shared the missionaries\u0026rsquo; fanaticism to do away with the heathen idolatry. Some of the East India Company officials, for instance, gave more sympathetic accounts of \u0026rsquo;the Hindoo religion\u0026rsquo;. Among the latter was Alexander Dow, who wrote a dissertation on \u0026rsquo;the Hindoos\u0026rsquo; in his History of Hindustan (1768). What struck him about these Hindus was that they did not try to convert:\nContrary to the practice of all other religious sects, they admit of no converts; but they allow that every one may go to heaven his own way, though they perhaps suppose, that theirs is the most expeditious method to obtain that important end. They chuse (sic) rather to make a mystery of their religion, than impose it upon the world, like the Mahommedans, with the sword, or by means of the stake, after the manner of some pious Christians .\nAs he repeats a few pages further, the Hindus never tried to convince others that theirs was the one true way to heaven:\nIt is, as we have already observed, a principle peculiar to the Hindoo religion, not to admit of proselytes. But instead of being solicitous about gaining converts, they always make a mystery of their faith. Heaven, say they, is like a palace with many doors, and every one may enter in his own way .\nMany would later join Dow in pointing out the peculiar absence of an urge to convert in the Hindu religion. This absence becomes peculiar only if one expects each and every religion to convert. How does one come to such a belief? On the one hand, Dow could have reached this point through induction. All religious sects he had encountered so far did convert, and thus he expected the same to be true of the Hindus. Considering the limited number of religions he could possibly have known in the 18th century, this makes a rather weak case. On the other hand, Dow could simply have assumed that all religions do proselytise. That is, he may have held an image of religion which told him that there is continuous competition among religions with respect to gaining converts. Dow may not have been a fanatic or a missionary, but of course he was a Christian. He shared this image with his fellow Christians. It derived from the belief that religion revolves around the struggle between God and the devil for the souls of men and women. Satan seduces humanity with subtle lies; God saves with the gift of truth. Given this background, the surprise must have been great indeed when one came about a religion that did not in the least bother about gaining converts.\nTo the more zealous Christians, the Indian subcontinent literally appeared as a battleground of the clash between God\u0026rsquo;s truth and Satan\u0026rsquo;s fraud. In the early 19th century, the evangelistic missionaries of the London Missionary Society already knew what to expect when they set foot on Indian soil. One of them, George Gogerly, tells us \u0026ldquo;an unusual feeling of solemnity\u0026rdquo; gradually crept over his mind as he caught his first sight of India:\nBefore me was the land of idolatry, concerning which I had heard and read so much; and I was now to come into contact with that mighty system of superstition and cruelty which was holding millions enslaved in its bonds; to see its hateful rites, and by the exhibition of the Truth, to contend with its dreadful power .\nThe missionaries had their expectations confirmed everywhere in the traditional practices and stories of the Indians. When they were confronted by \u0026ldquo;the vaunted holy books of the Hindus,\u0026rdquo; the strongest terms of denunciation could not do. In the words of William Campbell:\nIn what terms shall I describe the Hindu mythology? There was never, in any age, nor in any country, a superstition so cruel, so atrocious and so diabolical as that which has reigned over this people. It is a personification of evil. Satan seems to have used all his ingenuity, his malice and his gigantic power to create a system which would represent all his own attributes upon the earth, render its votaries as much like his angels as possible, and make Hindosthan an image of the infernal regions .\nWhen this is how one views the practices and the stories of the Hindus, the desire to convert must be strong indeed: the Hindus have to be liberated from the mighty system of superstition that holds them enslaved in its bonds. What should come in its stead? Why, the Truth, of course! That is, the true message of the atoning death of Jesus Christ has to replace the false Hindu mythology. The worship of the true God must replace the honouring of the false gods. For instance, when Christian Wolff arrived at Goa on October 31, 1833 and saw the cross of Christ planted and heard the church bells ringing, he could not help but exclaim: \u0026ldquo;Behold! the triumph of the cross over idolatry\u0026rdquo; .\nThis was not just the victory cry of an aggressive religion out to rule the world. Instead, these Christians were honestly and deeply concerned about the souls of the Indian subjects of the Empire. In his Letters on India: With Special Reference to the Spread of Christianity (1840), for instance, Reverend William Buyers writes the following:\nThe fact that nearly one hundred millions of our fellow-subjects are living and dying in a state of awful estrangement from God, and without the means of having that estrangement removed – the victims of error, superstition, pollution and horrid cruelty – while we possess every facility of access to them, involves a responsibility the most tremendous that can possibly be conceived .\nAnother missionary, William Carey, also reminds the Christians of their obligations in his An inquiry into the Obligations of the Christians, to Use the Means for the Conversion of the Heathens. He asks rhetorically:\nAfter all, the uncivilised state of the heathen, instead of affording an objection against preaching the gospel to them, ought to furnish an argument for it. Can we as men, or as Christians, hear that a great part of our fellow creatures, whose souls are as immortal as ours, and who are as capable as ourselves, of adorning the gospel, contributing by their preaching, writings, or practices to the glory of our Redeemer\u0026rsquo;s name, and the good of this church, are inveloped (sic) in ignorance and barbarism? Can we hear that they are without the gospel, without government, without laws, and without arts, and sciences; and not exert ourselves to introduce amongst them the sentiments of men, and of christians?\nWhy were the Reverend Buyers, the Reverend Carey, and their Christian audience burdened by the responsibility to bring their fellow-human beings back to God? In Christ, they believed, God had disclosed His will to humanity. It is only through belief in – and submission to – His revealed will that human beings can be saved from the devil and eternal damnation. Thus, it becomes the duty of the Christians to try and convert others. It would be sheer cruelty and a violation of God\u0026rsquo;s will not to do so.\nThis background allows us to make sense of the claims of both Indian and European Christians that conversion is a right and a duty of the religious. They simply have to share the universal truth of Christ with the rest of the humankind. They should at least attempt to convince the heathens that the latter\u0026rsquo;s corrupt beliefs ought to be replaced with pure Christian doctrine. This explains why E Stanley Jones reacted so strongly to Gandhi\u0026rsquo;s claim that every nation\u0026rsquo;s religion is as good as any other. And it also accounts for the position of the Indian Christians in the constituent assembly debates. Listen to how two Christian authors, J F Butler and S Samuel, summed up the issue in a pamphlet entitled The Right of Conversion, issued shortly before the inauguration of the constituent assembly:\nTruth is universal – true, and therefore good, for all: hence, when it fully grips a man, it (or what is sincerely taken to be it) grips him not only as a thing to hold, but as a thing to spread. And (subject to the usual provisioes (sic) about anti-social conduct) a man has a right to give due expression to so fundamental a conviction as this. This right is a universal one (cited in Kim 2003:40).\nAs the true religion conveys the will of God for the humankind, its truth should be spread among all the nations. Although God and Satan are not always explicitly present in the contemporary pleas for the right to convert, the notion of turning from false to true religion presupposes the opposition between the true God and the false god. This remains the implicit background that propels demands for the right to convert.1\nFrom the 16th to the 21st century, the Christians have viewed their encounter with the Hindu traditions as a battle between Christianity and idolatry. This theological framework attributes certain characteristic properties to religion: it is conceived of as a struggle between the true and the false. The struggle has different aspects to it. Firstly, it involves rivalry between religions with regard to the truth of doctrines. Insofar as different religions are either true or false, they revolve around a set of doctrines or beliefs. Therefore, the Christians oppose the Hindu traditions to the Christian religion in terms of the beliefs these \u0026lsquo;rival religions\u0026rsquo; proclaim. The main issue of religion is to make a choice between these different sets of beliefs – the message of the atoning death of Jesus Christ and the related precepts on the one hand or the errors of false religion on the other. Secondly, the competition between religions revolves around the gaining of converts. The true religion strives to save the souls of men and women, while false religion keeps them in the command of the devil. This can also be put in terms of their respective ends. The true religion is the only path to salvation. Hell is the fatal destination of all other religions. Thirdly, the rivalry does not only concern the life to come, but is also expressed in the conduct of the followers of the different religions here on earth. As false religion, Hinduism embodies immorality.2 And the true religion of Christianity exemplifies morality. Conversion, then, cannot but be a fundamental right, since it allows individuals to be guided from falsity to truth and from depravity to the good.\nCountless Rivers Flowing Seaward\nThe attacks of the Christian missionaries on the native traditions provoked reaction among the Indians. Surprisingly, this did not take the form of a plea for the truth of the Hindu religion. Nor did the response consist of a counter-attack on the Christian teachings. We can move back to the 18th century to get a flavour of Hindu resistance to the missionary zeal. In 1719, Ziegenbalg published reports of some conferences in which he had discussed the truth of the Christian religion with the \u0026lsquo;Malabarian\u0026rsquo; natives. The first conference gives an account of Ziegenbalg\u0026rsquo;s attempt to convince one of the local brahmins of the falsity of his religion. When the missionary urged him and his fellow Hindus to \u0026ldquo;break off the Cords of inveterate Errors, and save your own Souls, seeking diligently the knowledge of the One only True God,\u0026rdquo; the brahmin gave the following retort; \u0026ldquo;Our Religion is Venerable for its Antiquity, and has been professed by many pious Kings and holy prophets, thro\u0026rsquo; an Uninterrupted Succession of many incircling Ages …\u0026rdquo; . His religion could not be an imposture, the brahmin continued, since so many generations had continued its practice. In Ziegenbalg\u0026rsquo;s opinion this was a ridiculous argument:\nUninterrupted succession, and great throngs of proselytes are no characteristicks of the truth of any religion; else it would follow, that the devil is very orthodox: For he is as famous for the multitude of his disciples, as he is for his hoary venerable antiquity. But you must judge of the goodness or badness of religion, by the Fundamental Articles thereof, agreeing or disagreeing with the revealed word of the true God; but you Malabarians having no Knowledge of God\u0026rsquo;s Word, can take no Cognisance of what is true Worship, believing with an implicit Faith, the Fables and Reveries of Tradition-mongers, your Poets and Doctors ….\nThe brahmin\u0026rsquo;s conclusion that his religion must be \u0026rsquo;true\u0026rsquo;, because it had existed for so many ages, was \u0026ldquo;altogether illogical and an unjust Way of arguing,\u0026rdquo; according to Ziegenbalg . Nevertheless, the Hindus consistently defended their tradition in terms of its antiquity, rather than in terms of truth. In another conference, while Ziegenbalg was heaping ridicule on the Hindu deities, \u0026ldquo;a Venerable Old Man\u0026rdquo; stood up and said: \u0026ldquo;… that we have no True, but false Gods in our Country, this you are still to demonstrate: For tho\u0026rsquo; the Christians call us Heathens, we are not so in Reality; but we are a very Ancient Nation, whose Religion is as Old as the World itself…\u0026rdquo; .\nTo a Christian missionary, these claims to antiquity provided no proof for the value of a religion. The European heathens had also worshipped the devil for thousands of years before they were enlightened by Christianity. Besides, Ziegenbalg asserted, God had from the beginning of time given to human kind the promise of sending his son as the redeemer: \u0026ldquo;And thus you see, that the Christian Religion has been professed from the Beginning of the World, and is certainly the most Ancient of all Religions; and your Religion is nothing else but the Corruption of ours\u0026rdquo; . But when Ziegenbalg explained the promise of God\u0026rsquo;s grace in Christ, his brahmin opponent was equally unimpressed:\nI believe all you say of God\u0026rsquo;s Dealings with you White Europeans, to be true; but his Appearances and Revelations among us Black Malabarians, have been quite otherwise: And the Revelations he made of himself in this Land are as firmly believ\u0026rsquo;d here to be true, as you believe those made in your Country: For as Christ in Europe was made Man; so here our God Wischtnuwas born among us Malabarians; And as you hope for Salvation through Christ; so we hope for Salvation through Wischtnu; and to save you one way, and us another, is one of the Pastimes and Diversions of Almighty God .\nThe Christian religion might be fine for the Europeans, the brahmin suggested, but the Hindu traditions were as good for the Indians. In other words, the Hindus simply refused to see Christianity as a rival to their own traditions. No matter how much the missionaries stressed the falsity of the Hindu religion, their subjects of conversion maintained that \u0026ldquo;every one may be saved by his own religion, if he does what is Good, and shuns Evil\u0026rdquo; . And when Ziegenbalg tried to show how wicked and ridiculous their Gods were, one of the \u0026ldquo;Malabarian\u0026rdquo; Hindus stood up and told him \u0026ldquo;that it does not become an holy Man to blaspheme our Gods; for true Piety despises no Man upon Account of Religion; and \u0026rsquo;tis therefore we Malabarians do neither condemn nor despise the Christians upon the Account of their Religion\u0026rdquo; .\nOver the next few centuries, the Christian colonials would make more attempts to convince the Indians that Jesus Christ was the only way to salvation. In 1839, the East India Company servant and Orientalist John Muir published the Matapariksa, a Sanskrit tract that – as always – was to prove that Christianity was true religion while Hinduism was false. When three Hindu scholars wrote rejoinders to this tract, they opposed the idea that one single religion was to be followed by all human beings. One of them, Nilakantha Goreh, pointed out the many different ways of attaining \u0026lsquo;moksha\u0026rsquo;:\nIf someone located in Gaya wants to go to Kasi, he asks people there and they tell him, \u0026lsquo;You must go west,\u0026rsquo; whereas an inhabitant of Prayaga, wanting to go to Kasi, asks people there and is told, to the contrary, \u0026lsquo;Go east\u0026rsquo;. Going both east and west, which is by all means contradictory, yields one result on account of being located in different places. By the same token, one way (to salvation) would not be rewarding to (all) men, whose aptitudes are different, on account of the unarguable maturation of their good and bad deeds. Reflecting in these terms, Bhagavan, an ocean of compassion, made various kinds of margas by which everyone may attain salvation. For instance, among all the scriptures, the Sankhya, Vaisesika and others, likewise the devotional margas of Vaishnavas, etc, in which their faults are completely done away with by means of much examination and meditation, some people esteem the Vaisesika, some the Sankhya or others, some the Vaisnava marga, and others the Saiva, etc. This indicates that people have different aptitudes … Yet only one among the margas yields a direct result, it alone is followed by people whose aptitude is pure .\nAs there are various kinds of people with different capacities and skills, so there are several paths they can take to arrive at moksha. This is not to say that all paths are equal. As another critic of Muir\u0026rsquo;s, Somanatha, wrote:\nMen who travel on other roads are not said to be competent for the Vedic marga. It is for this reason that Hari would be displeased when someone spurns his own religion. … When men who dwell in various quarters are going to a certain city, in no way whatsoever would they reach it by only on one path. Likewise, those men, whom the all-creator made to possess different qualifications (adhikara) and (put into) different situations, would be unable to attain God by means of any single path. …For each person his own religion is best; the same religion would be perilous for another person. Now, therefore, praise be to those who worship Hari according to their religion without reviling other .\nThe religion one should follow depends on one\u0026rsquo;s specific situation. Therefore, persons belonging to different religions should neither dismiss their own religion nor that of others. In fact, the deities would be displeased to see this happen. If this is basic to religion, this \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo; is different from the phenomenon the Christians were describing. In one case, the diversity of religions is said to consist of one path through which God saves humanity from eternal damnation, while the other paths are the devil\u0026rsquo;s snares. In the other case, the diversity of religions corresponds to the innate diversity among human beings. Various valid paths exist, which have been developed for – and by – different groups of people.\nIn the 18th and the 19th century, the Hindus had not as yet adopted the tendency of the Christians to conceive of religion in terms of truth and falsity. This would change in the 20th century, when Mahatma Gandhi began to expound his views on the relation between religion and truth. In a \u0026lsquo;discussion on fellowship\u0026rsquo; between Gandhi and some members of the Council of International Federation, which was published in Young India in 1928, Gandhi explained his position on this issue:\nI came to the conclusion long ago, after a prayerful search and study and discussion with as many people as I could meet, that all religions were true and also that all had some error in them, and that whilst I hold my own, I should hold others as dear as Hinduism, from which it logically follows that we should hold all as dear as our nearest kith and kin and that we should make no distinction between them. So we can only pray, if we are Hindus, not that a Christian should become a Hindu, or if we are Musselmans, not that a Hindu or a Christian should become a Musselman, nor should we ever secretly pray that anyone should be converted, but our inmost prayer should be that a Hindu should be a better Hindu, a Muslim a better Muslim and a Christian a better Christian .\nDifferent Paths to Realisation\nAll religions are true, Gandhi suggests, and all have some error in them. Again, we can only note how strongly this notion differs from that of the Christians. If no religion is false, there is simply no point in religious conversion. There is no question of turning from falsity to truth by converting from one religion to the other. So, even if Gandhi appropriates the Christian vocabulary of \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo; and \u0026rsquo;truth\u0026rsquo;, the statement \u0026lsquo;a religion is true\u0026rsquo; has a completely different meaning to him. It does not mean that this particular religion is the unique gift of God that leads humanity to salvation. Rather, it means that this religion is one of various roads human beings can take to reach \u0026rsquo;the goal\u0026rsquo;. In his own words: \u0026ldquo;Religions are different roads converging to the same point. What does it matter that we take different roads so long as we reach the same goal? Wherein is the cause for quarrelling?\u0026rdquo; When all religions lead to the same goal, one should not try to have others follow one\u0026rsquo;s own path. One should rather strive to improve one\u0026rsquo;s own practice of religion and stimulate the devotees of other religions to do the same.\nGandhi was not the only one to translate the Hindu view that human beings could follow various paths to moksha into the proposition that all religions are true. In the Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna, Ramakrishna is recorded to have made the same point about the variety of paths: \u0026ldquo;God can be realised through all paths. It is like your coming to Dakshineswar by carriage, by boat, by steamer or on foot. You have chosen the way according to your convenience and taste; but the destination is the same. Some of you have arrived earlier than others, but all have arrived\u0026rdquo; (cited in Neufeldt 1987:67). And he also presented the claim that all religions are true as the equivalent of this point: \u0026ldquo;God can be realised through all paths. All religions are true. The important thing is to reach the roof. You can reach it by stone stairs or wooden stairs or by bamboo steps or by a rope. You can also climb up by a bamboo pole\u0026rdquo; (cited in Neufeldt 1987:68).\nWhat does it mean for these Hindu sages to say that all religions are true? When the Christians attribute truth to their religion, they are referring to a particular set of doctrines – including, for instance, that humanity is tainted by original sin and can be saved only through Christ\u0026rsquo;s redemptive death – which is god-given truth according to them. Other religions consist of deviant sets of doctrines and therefore they are necessarily false. If the Hindu thinkers were addressing the same issue of doctrinal truth, the claim that all religions are true would render them inconsistent. That is, if this means that all doctrines of all religions are true – even when standing in plain contradiction – then it also implies each and every statement about the world is true. This was not the message the Hindu thinkers intended to convey. As yet, we cannot argue conclusively what \u0026rsquo;truth\u0026rsquo; did mean to them. But it certainly does not concern the truth of doctrines or claims about the world. In their view, this kind of truth predicate does not apply to religion. In Radhakrishnan\u0026rsquo;s words: \u0026ldquo;The Hindu attitude to religion is interesting. While fixed intellectual beliefs mark off one religion from another, Hinduism sets itself no such limits. Intellect is subordinated to intuition, dogma to experience, outer expression to inward realisation\u0026rdquo; .\nWhen religion does not revolve around the truth of a particular set of beliefs, it becomes futile to compare different religions in terms of their respective truth or falsity. Or, as Swami Vivekananda put it, only those who do not properly understand religion, insist that religions be compared in order to decide which is the best. Religion, according to him, has nothing to do with the truth of certain views, but everything with \u0026ldquo;the great universal truth\u0026rdquo;. Instead of being contradictory, religions are supplementary, said Vivekananda, \u0026ldquo;each religion, as it were, takes up one part of the great universal truth and spends its whole force in embodying and typifying that part of the great truth\u0026rdquo; . Different religious traditions are not conceived of as rivals, neither when it comes to the ultimate goal they pursue, nor where it concerns the morality of their followers:\nWe do not say that ours is the only way to salvation. Perfection can be had by everybody, and what is the proof? Because we see the holiest of man in all countries, good men and women everywhere, whether born in our faith or not. Therefore it cannot be held that ours is the only way to salvation. \u0026ldquo;Like so many rivers flowing from different mountains, all coming and mingling their waters in the sea, all the different religions, taking their births from different standpoints of fact, come unto Thee.\u0026rdquo; This is a part of the child\u0026rsquo;s everyday prayer in India. With such everyday prayers, of course, such ideas as fighting because of differences of religion are simply impossible .\nIt is not as though the Hindu spokesmen were ignorant of Christianity\u0026rsquo;s claims to universality. But even after spending many years on \u0026ldquo;the comparative study of religion\u0026rdquo;, the philosopher Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan did not consent with the Christian notion of true and false religion. In fact, he went so far as to say that the idea of one single religion for the humankind is illogical:\nThe illogical idea of one single religion for all mankind, one set of dogmas, one cult, one system of ceremonies which all individuals must accept on pain of persecution by the people and punishment by God, is the product of unreason and intolerance. A religion represents the soul of the people, its peculiar spirit, thought, and temperament. It is not a mere theory of the supernatural which we can put on or off as we please. It is an expression of the spiritual experience of the race, a record of its social evolution, an integral element of the society in which it is found .\nThe religion of a people is a record of its social evolution and an expression of its spiritual experience. To understand what Radhakrishnan means, we can turn back to the Hindus who told Ziegenbalg that they had venerable antiquity on their side, since they were \u0026ldquo;a very Ancient Nation whose Religion is as Old as the World itself\u0026rdquo;. Religion, both to these 17th century Indians and to a 20th century Indian philosopher, is the tradition of a people or a community. It consists of the practices, customs, and stories that have been passed on by the ancestors of this community from ancient times.3 Therefore, the older it is, the more respectable. When they are accused of being followers of false religion, the Hindus reply that their religion is tradition, so how can it be false? As tradition, religion represents the past experience of a people, and hence the idea of one single religion for humankind becomes illogical or even inconceivable.\nThe foregoing permits us to sum up some of the properties which Hindus attribute to the phenomenon they have called \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo; since colonial times. On the one hand, religion consists of a variety of paths an individual can take to attain moksha. On the other, religion is the ancestral tradition of a people, viz, the system of practices, customs, and stories a particular community has passed on over time. In both aspects, different religions are not rivals with respect to gaining converts nor competitors with respect to truth. Religion does not revolve around the belief in a system of doctrines, which is either true or false. Therefore, truth predicates do not apply to the object that religion is. All religions may be true in the sense that they all lead to the same goal of moksha, but no religion can possibly be false. Finally, the various religions are not rivals when it comes to the morality of their followers. All religious traditions produce good men and women.\nThese traits of religion, as the Hindus view it, allow us to take a first step in understanding the antagonist position in the conversion dispute. For instance, in December 1946, a conference of the heads of various Hindu institutions issued a memorandum to the constituent assembly, in which they concluded that \u0026ldquo;ocial peace and political stability can best be secured by allowing cultural and religious groups to live their own life, unhampered by external interference and aggression,\u0026rdquo; letting the people \u0026ldquo;continue in the faith in which they were born,\u0026rdquo; free from \u0026ldquo;proselytising interference\u0026rdquo; . Or, as the Constitution of the Hindu nation of Nepal puts it: \u0026ldquo;Every citizen, subject to the current traditions, shall practice and profess his own religion as handed down from ancient times. Provided that no person shall be entitled to convert another person to his religion.\u0026rdquo; When religion is the tradition of a community and one of various valid paths, this advocacy of non-interference makes perfect sense. The proselytising drive of the Christian religion, then, indeed becomes \u0026ldquo;one-sided violence\u0026rdquo;, as Swami Dayananda Saraswati (of the Arsha Vidya Gurukulam, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu) wrote in his *Open Letter to His Holiness The Pope John Paul II.*This document – composed on the occasion of the pope\u0026rsquo;s visit to India in 1999 – voices the hurt conversion causes to those who conceive of religion as tradition:\nAny protest against religious conversion is always branded as persecution, because it is maintained that people are not allowed to practice their religion, that their religious freedom is curbed. The truth is entirely different. The other person also has the freedom to practice his or her religion without interference. That is his/her birthright. Religious freedom does not extent (sic) to having a planned programme of conversion. Such a programme is to be construed as aggression against the religious freedom of others.\n\u0026ldquo;Religious conversion is violence and it breeds violence\u0026rdquo;, the Swami concludes. Thus, when religion is the tradition that makes a people into a people, conversion becomes a disrupting interference in the life of a community.\nMisunderstanding Religion and Conversion\nTo conclude this interim research report, we will formulate a hypothesis to account for the lack of mutual understanding in the Indian debate on conversion. In the foregoing, it has become clear that the Christians and the Hindus attribute mutually exclusive properties to religion. The former claim that some religions are false, that different religions are rivals, and that one religion leads to heaven and all others to hell. The latter say that no religion is false, that religions cannot be rivals, and that all religions lead to the same goal. These are contradictory predicates that cannot be ascribed to one and the same object.4 Therefore, we are compelled to conclude that the Hindus and the Christians are talking about two different things when they discuss \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo;. The implications for the dispute on conversion need further investigation. However, one implication is clear. If it turns out to be true that the advocates and the opponents have different objects in mind when discussing \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo; (and its relation to conversion), they should continue to have great difficulties in making sense of each other\u0026rsquo;s statements and arguments.\nThis raises several problems. How come the two parties involved in the debate have not seen that the term \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo; as they use it does not refer to the same object? This cannot be answered hastily. The conversion debate has gone on for a few centuries and the participants have been as gifted as they come. Thus, the lack of understanding they show towards each other becomes all the more difficult to explain. Likewise, why have they continued to engage in this debate with such vigour, in spite of the mutual incomprehension? Our future research on the question of conversion in India will focus on these and other questions.\nNotes\n1 We have tried to elaborate this point in our ongoing work on conversion, truth, and violence. 2 For an analysis of the impact which the Christian view of Hinduism as an immoral and false religion has had on the contemporary understanding of the Indian caste system, see Raf Gelders and Willem Derde (2003).\n3 For a scientific account of the dynamic of religion and its implications for the relation between religion and tradition, see S N Balagangadhara (1994).\n4 For a further analysis of this aspect of the Indian debate on conversion and its implications for the neutrality of the secular state in India, see S N Balagangadhara and Jakob De Roover: \u0026lsquo;Secular State as the Harbinger of Religious Violence\u0026rsquo; (forthcoming).\nReferences\nBalagangadhara, S N (1994): \u0026lsquo;The Heathen in His Blindness…\u0026rsquo;: Asia, The West and the Dynamic of Religion, E J Brill, Leiden.

Europeans from diverse ideological and religious backgrounds identified the brahmins as priests and brahmanism as a \u0026lsquo;religion of the priests\u0026rsquo;. This common understanding derived its consistency from a Christian understanding of religion. Even the writings of Rammohun Roy and Babasaheb Ambedkar, this article suggests, reveal an unconditional acceptance of Europe\u0026rsquo;s conceptualisation in a debate over religion that continued into the 20th century\nIndian Society in the Orientalist-Anglicist Debate\nContemporary research that addresses the important period of the early 19th century in India generally takes the controversy between Anglicists and Orientalists as a useful explanatory framework . Convinced that the Indian society was saturated by heathendom, Anglicists considered India to be corrupt. They believed that its culture was degenerate and its population irrational, retarded, superstitious and morally depraved. The Orientalists, on the other hand, genuinely sought to understand the foreign culture. Surely, they wanted to bring reform. But they were certain that a transformation could only be successful if it resonated with the mores of the natives. Hence, they studied the Indian culture, learned its local languages, collected and preserved what belonged to its cultural inheritance, and discovered a grand past that presented an India excelling in the political, social, religious and intellectual domains.\nThe differences between the two factions are generally considered significant and important . However, we would like to highlight that they turn out to be superficial when it comes to the assessment of the fundamental structure of the Indian society. Unerringly, both identified brahmins as the \u0026lsquo;priests\u0026rsquo;. They both were convinced that these \u0026lsquo;priests\u0026rsquo; had a negative influence on religion and society. Brahmins were held responsible for the creation and sanctification of the caste system, which brought social development to a halt. They accepted as true that this system consisted of a rigid social compartmentalisation and that it was created to preserve religious and social privileges of the brahmin caste. They were convinced that the brahmins used their religious authority to dominate those in civil power which explained why the system of hierarchical castes was not contested by those in power as well, etc.\nIf there were differences between Orientalists and Anglicists in this regard, they were very shallow. Anglicists found Indian culture and society intrinsically corrupt from the very beginning. Orientalists, however, saw India\u0026rsquo;s culture as being based on sound principles which steadily degenerated. But the cause of corruption, however, was in both cases the same, i e, \u0026lsquo;brahmanism\u0026rsquo;.\nIn this article, we propose that both the idea of religious degeneration and the role played by the priests in this process are derived from deep seated Christian conceptions of religion. On the one hand, the biblical story of a god-given religion that was subsequently corrupted through the course of time was the general framework that structured the history of Christianity and of all the other so-called religions. On the other hand, because Christianity assigned a primary role to the clergy, religion was an affair of the priests only. Consequently, the mechanism of degeneration had to be found in the priesthood: priests became the instruments of the devil and began to transform the original god-given religion. This understanding of religion, we would like to suggest, structured the European quest for the \u0026lsquo;religious\u0026rsquo; elsewhere. Brahmins were identified as \u0026lsquo;priests\u0026rsquo;, who created \u0026lsquo;brahmanism\u0026rsquo;, which was imposed upon Indian society. One of the main elements of this sacerdotal religion that preserved their privileges was the caste system. This conception, we would further like to emphasise, became more poignant, more structured and more coherent against the background of the reformation and the Protestant critiques of the Roman-Catholic church.\nIf this suggestion is convincing, the prevalence of Europe\u0026rsquo;s conceptualisation in the modern Indian intellectual\u0026rsquo;s reflection on his own society is nothing but remarkable. Even though there existed a long tradition of criticism of brahmins and caste in India itself, Rammohun Roy, for example, while criticising contemporary brahmanism vigorously, merely echoed the assessment of the British. Similarly, Babasaheb Ambedkar did the same a century later when he took up its sacerdotal invention of caste along familiar lines. By doing so, both accepted exactly that which Orientalists and Anglicists shared: they ended up criticising \u0026lsquo;brahmins\u0026rsquo; as \u0026lsquo;priests\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;brahmanism\u0026rsquo; as a deprived \u0026lsquo;religion of the priests\u0026rsquo;.\nOrientalist Conceptualisation of \u0026lsquo;Sacerdotal Slavery\u0026rsquo;\nJohn Zephania Holwell was one of the first to clearly formulate the principles that would guide the Orientalist approach to India. His Interesting Historical Events, Relative to the Provinces of Bengal, and the Empire of Indostan, first published in 1765-67, was highly influential both in England as well as across continental Europe. It had a significant impact on the French philosophes and would be praised by German romantics .\nHolwell himself was very conscious of the significance of his own work and presented it as a break with the available literature on India from the ancients until the present time. Most important, he was especially critical of descriptions of idolatry inspired by the zeal of religious fanaticism. Knowledge of the native languages was essential for the success of any neutral representation. For were the traveller \u0026lsquo;skilled in the language of the people he describes, sufficiently to trace the etymology of their words and phrases, and capable of diving into the mysteries of their theology, he would probably be able to evince to us that such seemingly preposterous worship had the most sublime rational source and foundation\u0026rsquo; (1765: 9-10). Despite Holwell\u0026rsquo;s promise to shed light upon contemporary India, his method to \u0026lsquo;dive into the mysteries of theology\u0026rsquo; forced him to make a clear distinction between the present and the past. Confronted by an endless multitude of rituals and ceremonies, this is how he assessed the situation:\n… we should touch only on the original principal tenets of these ancient people the Gentoos; for were we to penetrate into, and discuss the whole of their modern ceremonials, and complicated modes of worship; our labour would be without end: these are as diffuse, as the ancient fundamental tenets of bramah are short, pure, simple and uniform…(Holwell, 1776: 1, all emphasis in the original).\nAgain a so-called typical Orientalist stance was born. The Indians had been rational, in a period long gone. From then onwards the history of India reads like a history of growing corruption and decline. Holwell was very explicit about the cause of this corruption. The pristine, pure and simple religious tenets, promulgated by Bramah were originally conserved in a text called the Chatah Bhade. However, the brahmins, who were supposed to preserve this message, made it increasingly obscure and forced a nation into sacerdotal slavery. More remarkably, Holwell found this process described in the \u0026lsquo;Shastas\u0026rsquo; of the brahmins themselves. After a period of 1000 years in which the original religious doctrines were faithfully preserved, the \u0026lsquo;Shastas\u0026rsquo; continued thus:\n… about the close of this period, some Goseyns (Gentoo bishops) and Battezaaz bramins ; combining together, wrote a paraphrase on the Chatah Bhade, which they called the Chatah Bhadeof bramah, or the six scriptures of the mighty spririt; in this work the original text of bramah\u0026rsquo;s Chatah Bhadewas still preserved …it was now also that they first began to veil in mysteries, the simple doctrines of Bramah. That about five hundred years later … the Goseyns and Battezaaz bramins, published a second exposition, or commentary on theChatah Bhade; which swelled the Gentoo scriptures to 18 books …the original text of the Chatah Bhade, was in a manner sunk and alluded to only; the histories of their Rajahs and country, were introduced under figures and symbols, and made a part of their religious worship, and a multitude of ceremonials, and exterior modes of worship, were instituted; which the commentators said were implied in Bramah\u0026rsquo;s Chatah Bhade, although not expressely directed therein, by him; and the whole enveloped in impenetrable obscurity by allegory and fable, beyond the comprehension even of the common tribe of bramins themselves; the laity being thus precluded from the knowledge of their original scriptures had a new system of faith broached unto them, which their ancestors were utterly strangers to .\nThe success of these developments was completely due to the brahmin priests. They clearly saw that the power of their class rested on making the laity dependent upon them and diverted the people from the original simple tenets of religion. Holwell continued that,\n… the Goseyns and bramins by the first of these Bhades, determined to enlarge, and establish it, by the promulgation of the last; for in this the exterior modes of worship were so multiplied, and such a numerous train of new divinities created,…that those professors of divinity, became of new and great importance, for the daily obligations of religious duties, which were by these new institutes imposed on every Gentoo, from the highest to the lowest rank of the people, were of so intricate, and alarming a nature, as to require a brahmin to be at hand, to explain and officiate, in the performance of them: they had however the address to captivate the minds of the vulgar, by introducing show and parade into all their principal religious feasts, as well as fasts; and by a new single political institution, to wit, the preservation of their caste or tribe, the whole nation was reduced to sacerdotal slavery .\nAlthough the citations speak for themselves, we would like to emphasise some important elements of the picture that is outlined here. The thrust of the argument is the replacement of the original pure religious tenets with something else: a corpus of complex and elaborated expositions and commentaries. What was not part of religion is made part of it and is falsely worshiped. Exterior modes of worship make religion hollow and bereave it from its content, i e, the essence of religion. What is not expressly directed in the original is made obligatory by sophisticated reasoning. Consequently, the religion is no longer accessible without the help of a specialist, i e, the priest. What keeps these developments going is the thirst for more power after the priests first tasted it. What begins as priestly power soon extends itself to a longing for worldly richness and civil authority. The result is caste: a political institution meant to keep a whole nation under the sway of sacerdotal slavery.\nHeydays of Orientalism\nDespite huge intellectual efforts, future generations of Orientalist scholars never fundamentally challenged the structure of Indian society outlined by Holwell: as far as its religion and its \u0026lsquo;priests\u0026rsquo; were concerned, even sympathetic voices did not change the picture. In the fifth edition of James Mill\u0026rsquo;s The History of British India, Horace Hayman Wilson agreed that India was far behind the stage that Europe had reached. Interestingly, he explained the difference by \u0026rsquo;the advantages we possess in a purer system of religious belief\u0026rsquo;, as against the character of the Indian religion and institutions (1858: 164 ff. 1).\nWhat an absence of pure religion could do, had already become clear in two lengthy essays on religious sects, published in subsequent volumes of the Asiatic Researches (1828, 1832). While the first discussed the so-called Vaishnavas, the second work provided a detailed account of Shaivas and miscellaneous sects. The discussion of the Vaishnava movement started with an outline of religious degradation. The second essay ended similarly. What distinguished these movements from the \u0026lsquo;purer system of belief\u0026rsquo; was bhakti or devotion to the deity. Bhakti was an invention, Wilson said, \u0026lsquo;and apparently a modern one … intended like that of the mystical holiness of the Guru, to extend their own authority\u0026rsquo; (1832: 312).\nOn the issue of caste Wilson tried to temper the condemnation Europeans had expressed. His lectures at Oxford demonstrated that even within the lowest classes caste was nothing but a subject of pride and privilege. As a matter of fact, those occupying the highest echelons didn\u0026rsquo;t seem to be attached to it: \u0026lsquo;in proportion as the scale of society descends, so are the people more tenacious of their caste\u0026rsquo; (1840: 107). Nevertheless, \u0026lsquo;he principle of the distinction\u0026rsquo; was still \u0026lsquo;indefensible…\u0026rsquo; (1840: 107). A similar ambiguous attitude characterised his description of brahmins. A brahmin of learning would never approve of the modern ritual and idolatry his less enlightened colleagues advocated. But still, Wilson stressed that a learned brahmin had temporal interests of his own: \u0026lsquo;he derives no small share of emolument and consideration from his connexion with religion, as the interpreter of the works in which it is taught\u0026rsquo; (1840: 81). Therefore, he wouldn\u0026rsquo;t oppose any innovation whatsoever as long as new doctrines and views did not \u0026lsquo;meddle … with existing institutions… or trespass upon the privileges, of the brahmans.\u0026rsquo; (1840: 86)\nDegradation also characterised The History of India by Mountstuart Elphinstone. Elaborating on Wilson\u0026rsquo;s essays referred to above, Elphinstone argued that monastic orders started to supplant the original purity of religion: theism as advocated by the Vedas was \u0026lsquo;supplanted by a system of gross polytheism and idolatry…\u0026rsquo; (1842: 86). The followers of the Vedas, i e, the brahmins, didn\u0026rsquo;t try to stop this: they permitted this worship of too many gods and never erected a temple for the One and Only – all for \u0026rsquo;the authority of custom and the interest of a priesthood.\u0026rsquo; (1842: 86) The new orders could not but recognise the divinity of brahmin laws and hence, \u0026lsquo;could not withhold their acknowledgement of the high station to which the class had raised itself by the authority of these writings\u0026rsquo; (1842: 61). Indeed, Elphinstone had already emphasised that at the time of Manu even the monarch was subjected to \u0026rsquo;the laws promulgated in the name of the divinity; and the influence of the brahmins … would afford a strong support to the injunctions of the code\u0026rsquo; (1842: 19). After Manu\u0026rsquo;s codification of the social structure the movement of decline accelerated further: as far as caste was concerned, the lowest classes had started to display \u0026lsquo;a large division of castes within themselves\u0026rsquo; (1842: 55).\nFinally, in a series of lectures given at Cambridge in 1882, Max Müller presented \u0026lsquo;India such as it was a thousand, two thousand, it may be three thousand years ago\u0026rsquo; and invited his students to look at its \u0026lsquo;religion … if only purified from the dust of 19 centuries…\u0026rsquo; (1883: 7-12). What we could learn from this course would be the manner in which \u0026rsquo;the human mind arrives by a perfectly rational process at all its later irrationalities.\u0026rsquo; (1883: 195) His preface to The Sacred Books of the East had already explained the manner in which the human mind arrived at that stage: \u0026lsquo;The priestly influence was at work, even before there were priests by profession, and when the priesthood had once become professional, its influence may account for much that would otherwise seem inexplicable in the sacred codes of the ancient world\u0026rsquo; (1879: 15).\nPriestly Despotism Taken for Granted\nOrientalist scholars might have presented their case in the garbs of rationality and open-mindedness. However, when it came to the identification of the brahmin \u0026lsquo;priests\u0026rsquo; as the cause for the degeneration of religion, the enslavement of the minds of the people, and the preservation of their own caste, their resemblance to the story told by Protestant zealots is remarkable.\nCharles Grant was one of the earliest and most influential representatives of the Evangelical movement. His greatest concern was the moral deprivation of the Indian population. To make this \u0026lsquo;wretched\u0026rsquo; state of affairs intelligible so that the East India Company could be more efficient in its amelioration, he had to identify the causes that had led to the present situation. The results of his search can be read in his famous *Observations on the State of Society among the Asiatic Subjects of Great Britain, Particularly with Respect to Morals; and the Means of Improving It.*Though originally written to support Wilberforce\u0026rsquo;s first attempt in 1793 to change the charter of the company in favour of missionary activities, it would only become widely acknowledged when it was published in the parliamentary papers of 1813.\nIn Grant\u0026rsquo;s view the brahmin tribe could be held responsible for almost everything he noticed in contemporary India. For their own benefit they had made the ignorant masses believe in a false religion. The rays of light that still shone through the Bhagavad-Gita had been \u0026lsquo;conceived from the vulgar\u0026rsquo; to support, together with the ceremonies of the Vedas, \u0026rsquo;the consequence, and the very existence of the brahminical order\u0026rsquo; (1792: 48). As Holwell wrote before, Grant argued that the brahmins \u0026lsquo;have made themselves indispensably necessary.\u0026rsquo; They had \u0026lsquo;formed the religion, they are the sole exclusive depositaries of its ordinances*… It is thus that abject slavery, and unparalleled depravity, have become distinguishing characteristics of the Hindoos\u0026rsquo;*(1792: 58).\nAgain, the running thread throughout Grant\u0026rsquo;s account was one of sacerdotal despotism. Where Holwell mentioned a \u0026rsquo;new political institution\u0026rsquo;, Grant claimed that the priests had deceived the ignorant masses and installed their superiority in a system of social gradation. This diverges from the genuine principles of equity, truth, and honesty that had truly influenced the spirit and the manners of the people. To demonstrate these principles Grant made more than generous use of William Jones\u0026rsquo; translation of the Manu Dharma Shastra (1794). The law, Grant said, \u0026lsquo;stands upon the same authority as the Hindoo religion; both are parts of one system, which they believe to have been divinely revealed.\u0026rsquo; (1792: 34). Nothing was clearer than that \u0026rsquo;this whole fabric is the work of a crafty and imperious priesthood, who feigned a divine revelation and appointment, to invest their own order, in perpetuity, with the most absolute empire over the civil state of the Hindoos, as well as over their minds\u0026rsquo; (1792: 35).\nContinuity of Discourse\nThe late 18th and 19th century works discussed above suggest a constancy and internal coherence in European accounts of Indian society across religious and ideological boundaries. Evangelicals and secular Orientalists transcended the Orientalist-Anglicist debate: both agreed that brahmanism was a religion created by priests who had used their religious authority to invent a system of social stratification. This conceptualisation would become the stock-in-trade of European knowledge about India and would become standard in the more general writings consumed by the European public at large. One of the most influential works in this genre was James Mill\u0026rsquo;s The History of British India.\nTo provide the British with the necessary knowledge to establish local government, Mill wanted to identify the stage India had reached on a scale of civilisations. For this purpose, Grant\u0026rsquo;s evaluation and explanation of Indian society was not difficult for Mill to accept: priestly despotism was, once again, the main evil that held sway over the subcontinent. After all, secular thinkers had already adopted the religious idea that \u0026lsquo;he priesthood is generally found to usurp the greatest authority, in the lowest state of society artfully clothe themselves with the terrors of religion\u0026rsquo; (1817: 48).\nMill argued that \u0026lsquo;just and rational views of God can be obtained from two sources alone: from revelation; or where that is wanting, from sound reflection upon the frame and government of the universe.\u0026rsquo; (1817: 186). Because the One and Only hadn\u0026rsquo;t been so benevolent as to reveal Himself to India and thus, because the Hindus lacked both, they \u0026lsquo;produced that heterogeneous and monstrous compound which has formed the religious creed of so great a portion of the human race; but composes a more stupendous mass in Hindustan than in any other country…\u0026rsquo; (1817: 191). Still, brahmins showed the tendency to corrupt things: with the insertion of flattery and the worship of heroes they had made it even worse than it ever was and anywhere had been, because \u0026lsquo;in Hindustan a greater and more powerful section of the people…have…been solely occupied in adding to its volume and augmenting its influence\u0026rsquo; (1817: 191). Having remixed and annotated the work others had done before him, Mill arrived at the same conclusion as his informants: \u0026lsquo;Never among any other people did the ceremonial part of religion prevail over the moral to a greater, probably to an equal extent…\u0026rsquo; (1817: 193). This religion was based on the prejudices of despotic brahmins. They alone were responsible for India\u0026rsquo;s decadence.\nThe original laws demonstrated that the Indian kings were merely instruments in the hands of brahmins; the classification of the people showed that \u0026rsquo;through a system of priestcraft, built upon the most tormenting superstition that ever harassed and degraded any portion of mankind, their minds were more enslaved than their bodies…\u0026rsquo; (1817: 472). Like Charles Grant before him, Mill made copious use of Jones\u0026rsquo;Institutes of Hindu Law (1794) to establish this claim: brahmins appeared as the sole guardians of the so-called sacred books, using their religion and sacerdotal caste-rules to exercise power over the civil sphere of kings and empires.\nMill\u0026rsquo;s account might have appeared as the secular counterpart of so-called evangelical interpretations. However, he was neither an ardent anglicist, nor was he an orientalist. He nevertheless accepted as self-evident the story which was shared by all of them about religious degeneration, the depraving influence of the brahmins and their creation of caste. When a story transcends all ideological and theoretical boundaries, there must be a more fundamental common framework from which its consistency is derived. We will suggest that this coherence could only be obtained from a christian conception of religion, and more precisely, from its Protestant variety.\nLiberty of Protestantism vs the Tyranny of Priesthood\nThe notion of degeneration of religion, as well as the concepts of \u0026lsquo;priests\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;priesthood\u0026rsquo;, were very familiar to the Europeans. Both had been essential to Christianity because they structured its understanding of religion. As the Old Testament told us, god had given mankind true religion upon creation. The same book continued that, ever since, this divine gift had been corrupted due to the efforts of the devil. When god revealed Himself and had chosen the people of Israel to make his first covenant, even the Jews, so the Christians told, were led astray by the multiple laws and the empty regulations which departed from the true religion. Thanks to the coming of Jesus, god restored His original bond with mankind by means of a \u0026lsquo;New Covenant\u0026rsquo;. However, even this was not safe from corruption. Fifteen hundred years after god uniquely revealed Himself in the figure of Christ, Protestants told us that Christianity had gone through a period of degeneration once again. Again a connection with the true religion had to be restored by means of direct access to the word of god, i e, the Bible.\nDuring the first centuries this biblical theme not only structured the relationship of Christianity with Judaism, it also structured its relationship with the so-called pagan Roman traditions that were transformed into a corruption of the original \u0026lsquo;purer system of beliefs\u0026rsquo;. As Balagangadhara summarised this kind of history writing:\nThere was once a religion, the true and universal one, which was the divine gift to all humankind. A sense or spark of divinity is installed in all races (and individuals) of humanity by the creator god himself. During the course of human history, this sense did not quite erode as it got corrupted. Idolatry, worship of the Devil (i e, of the false god and his minions) was to be the lot of humankind until god spoke to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and led their tribe back onto the true path .\nThe priests had been essential to Christianity in the sense that religion was an affair of the priests only: the flock of believers was merely supposed to do what the priests told it to do. The latter, therefore, was part of religion too. Thus, as the Christians saw it, religion was exactly that which the priests entertained. Protestantism would not alter this conception. On the contrary, Protestant critiques against the institutionalised church strengthened its hold, albeit in a rather peculiar manner. In defiance of the Catholic church, which preserved priesthood exclusively to the selected few, Protestants argued that all believers could be priests. They condemned the institutionalised church as the necessary mediator between man and god: the church had corrupted the true religion and hence, was nothing but an institute of the devil. As no shepherd could lead us to god, each one of us was \u0026lsquo;responsible\u0026rsquo; for his own salvation.\nThanks to this Christian understanding of religion, the mechanisms of corruption were clearly brought to the fore as well. If religion was a priest-centred activity, it were also the priests that were responsible for its degeneration. However, with the Protestant Reformation and its assessment of the Catholic church, critique of the priesthood as an instrument of the devil was not only of paramount importance, it had also further gained theoretical depth and consistency.\nTo protect the Christian public from the machinations of the devil, it was said, the priests had to preserve the word of god. However, while interpreting the Bible, they had made into religion what formerly was not part of it. Therefore, religion not only meant preserving god\u0026rsquo;s word: what the priests imposed upon the laity was part of religion as well. The tools these priests had used were many. Instead of preserving the purity of Revelation as it was written in the Bible, new creeds were added. Instead of keeping to the pure faith of the Bible, new prescriptions were made and new modes of worship promulgated. The cults of the saints and martyrs made human into the divine and multiplied religious feasts and festivals. Therefore, the story that the Protestants told about the history of the western church was a history of corruption and decline as well: the priesthood of the Catholic church had given in to the Antichrist and had used the true word of god to turn Christianity into heathendom. From now on, \u0026lsquo;Catholic Christianity was merely \u0026lsquo;Christian paganism\u0026rsquo;\u0026rsquo; .\nThose who benefited from all this were the priests only. In order to conceal their fraud, they kept the Bible secret behind the dark curtain of the Latin language. Instead of directing their attention to spiritual matters, they were interested in earthly wealth and honour. As the issue of indulgences clearly proved, the priesthood was said to exploit the people\u0026rsquo;s wealth for their own well-being; and so on and so forth… The power of kings depended on the Pope\u0026rsquo;s consent. With the Pope as the vicar of Christ and his universal jurisdiction, spiritual authority was more important than any temporal power. The papacy was accused of usurping princely power by claiming to be the highest authority on earth and by installing social hierarchies both within and outside the church.\nWhen Europe confronted the \u0026lsquo;pagan world\u0026rsquo; a second time, the Judeo-Christian theme of an original true religion and its subsequent degeneration still structured Europe\u0026rsquo;s conception of the history of the religious. The non-Christian religions had, at the most, fragments of insights derived from the true pristine religion which was implanted by god in all of us. Lacking revelation, however, they became false religions. Over a period of time they were corrupted even more, because the devil freely reigned over these religions through the medium of the pagan priests. As must be clear, this is exactly what the western authors were arguing for. The brahmins who performed and directed the rituals, who maintained temple complexes, etc, could only have been the priests of the Indians, be it of a false religion. What they imposed upon society as part of their religion must have been the work of the devil as well. The moulding of multiple traditions into brahmanism as a grand religion created by heathen priests was now inevitable.\nThe search for the carefully hidden \u0026lsquo;religious texts\u0026rsquo; became one of Europe\u0026rsquo;s obsessions. Differences between the \u0026lsquo;pure original\u0026rsquo; as embodied in those texts and that which the priests imposed upon the laity confirmed that priesthood was a similar phenomenon all over the world. The Catholic church knew of pilgrimages and indulgences; brahmanism displayed \u0026lsquo;ceremonial and pecuniary atonements.\u0026rsquo; As the Catholic clergy imposed a system of false prescriptions in its quest for worldly power, brahmins imposed a system of rules and prescription to preserve their own temporal interests. They had their own secret language too, i e, Sanskrit, and eagerly tried to conceal their fraud.\nAs Catholic priesthood was confined to the selected few, brahmins dominated Indian society through the institution of caste. As the priests of the church of Rome were the only rightful administers of the sacraments, Hinduism turned out to be a religion \u0026lsquo;of which the brahmins are the exclusive depositories of its ordinances\u0026rsquo;. The \u0026lsquo;brahmin church\u0026rsquo; had imposed social hierarchies due to its priestly despotism. Therefore, the most salient feature of this religion became the caste system, imposed upon society to preserve brahmin privileges. \u0026lsquo;Absolute empire over the civil state of the Hindus as over their minds\u0026rsquo; was exactly what priesthood and its craft had given birth to in Europe as well.\nIndian Intellectuals and Mantras of Anti-Brahmanism\nThe Judeo-Christian theme of religious degeneration and the Christian theological interpretation of religion as a religion of the priest did not only structure Europe\u0026rsquo;s identification of the brahmin priests and brahmanism. More remarkably, it even structured the conceptualisation of religion provided by Indian intellectuals in modern times. When Rammohun Roy published the first of his English works he \u0026lsquo;appealed to the sacred books…as bearing witness against the idolatry of the priest-ridden masses\u0026rsquo; (Müller cited in Mookerjee 1970: 32) Echoing European descriptions, Roy exclaimed that the brahmins had emphasised \u0026rsquo;to the utmost of their power, that part … which, treating of rites and festivals, is justly considered as the source of their worldly advantages and support of their alleged divinity\u0026rsquo; (1817: 88). The Hindus didn\u0026rsquo;t know that the Vedanta prohibited that which brahmins entertained because the brahmins permitted \u0026rsquo;themselves alone to interpret, or even to touch any book of the kind.\u0026rsquo; They had kept the \u0026lsquo;brahmin bible\u0026rsquo; secret \u0026lsquo;within the dark curtain of the Sanskrit language.\u0026rsquo; As a result \u0026rsquo;the practice of few Hindoos indeed bears the least accordance with its precepts.\u0026rsquo; (1816: 59) About the source of his inspiration, Roy is very explicit. In a letter to Alexander Duff, he declared that he had read about\nthe rise and progress of Christianity in apostolic times, and its corruption in succeeding ages, and then of the Christian Reformation which shook off these corruptions\u0026hellip; (and) that something similar might have taken place in India, and similar results might follow from a reformation of the popular idolatry (Cited in Collett 1913: 280).\nTherefore, in the preface to his translations of the Upanishads, he formulated his goal of demonstrating that the originals proved that the Indians were also familiar with the true conceptions of the One and Only. However, the brahmins had not only emphasised that which served their own interests; the texts were also written in an obscure language of allegory. His reading had to allow the Europeans to make their own judgement instead of deriving it from \u0026rsquo;the superstitious rites and habits daily encouraged and fostered by their self-interested leaders\u0026rsquo; (1819: 23). As his public already knew by then, this was a system \u0026lsquo;which destroys, to the utmost degree, the natural texture of society\u0026rsquo; – all by and for their self-interested leaders (1819: 23).\nMore than a century later Babasaheb Ambedkar whole-heartedly attacked those practices that Roy – according to his more critical readers – had overlooked, i e, caste practices. His views were well summarised in his exposé of the origin of the shudras. Referring to brahmin laws and a literary system of varnas, Ambedkar argued for the religious basis of caste. Its practices were laid down in books and explained that which the Europeans also saw: a corrupted society. Disregarding his opponents, he would continue \u0026rsquo;the exposure of the sacred books so that the Hindus may know that it is the doctrines contained in their sacred books which are responsible for the decline and fall of their country and their society…\u0026rsquo; (1947: 15).\nThat all this was the fault of a religion of priests was again clear from the start. The books were \u0026lsquo;almost entirely the creation of the brahmins … to sustain the superiority and privileges of the brahmins as against the non-brahmins\u0026rsquo; (1947: 16). Yet Ambedkar didn\u0026rsquo;t seem to wonder how brahmins managed to realise this supremacy when they kept the books devised for this purpose secret from the general public.\nBe this as it may, the brahmins were the forces behind transforming the Vedic concept of class system into the contemporary system of castes (cf Ambedkar 1917). Why did the brahmins do this? As he answered in his Annihilation of Caste, the caste system, \u0026lsquo;is a social system which embodies the arrogance and selfishness of a perverse section of the Hindus who were superior enough in social status to set it in fashion and who had the authority to force it on their inferiors\u0026rsquo; (1936: 50). Hence, the priestly brahmins had done this for the obvious reasons that they were arrogant, mercenary, and perverted. They were the ones who originated the exclusivity of class and the other classes merely imitated them.\nThat he merely accepted European authority and adopted polemical slogans might well be reflected in his belief in the remarkable explanatory power of this social system, based on that grand religion of priests. Caste explained the anti-social and selfish spirit of the Hindus and their unwillingness to forgive. It accounted for the timidity and cowardice that distinguished the Hindu from the Muslim and the Sikh – even though they are also said to be organised into a system of social hierarchy – and all this resulted in the Hindu\u0026rsquo;s low ways of treachery and cunning. Caste impeded public spirit, public charity, and public opinion (1936: 51-6). In other words: caste as deus ex machina explained the degradation prevalent in Indian society. Taking into account the many horror stories he provides us with, we might well conclude that caste is the embodiment of moral corruption, based on prejudices and sacred books, instilled by a perfidious section of the Indian population. The legislative measures he proposed to abolish this system should \u0026lsquo;help to kill brahminism and will help to kill caste which is nothing but brahminism incarnate.\u0026rsquo; (1936: 77).\nBoth reformers are divided by a century of changing socio-political circumstances. Each had its own political and/or religious agenda as well. Yet it is clear that the difference between orientalists and anglicists or Evangelicals others find so important in the context of modern Indian intellectual movement is of no relevance when it comes to an understanding of Indian religion and society among Indian intellectuals.\nIndian Intellectuals and the European Experience\nIf theological concepts structured the experience of the Europeans, how well could they capture the experience of the natives? Wilson suggested that a resistant attachment to caste corresponded with the lower classes. Elphinstone agreed and noticed that the lowest classes started to display a large division of castes among themselves. Indeed, from an empirical point of view, most will agree that a multitude of sub-castes can be identified in the so-called lowest social strata. To argue that priests imposed such an organisation upon society requires, minimally, the identification of an overarching organisation of priests. However, neither in the long haul of Indian history, nor in its present context has such a structure, necessary to impose upon society any social organisation whatsoever, been identified.\nSecondly, regarding their secret books, Grant claimed that \u0026lsquo;ith respect to the real tenets of the Hindus…they are to be taken from their ancient books…\u0026rsquo; (cited in Mill 1817: 410 ff). However, when Rammohun Roy later translated the Upanishads a contemporary pundit charged him with having fabricated them himself (Hay 1963: 46 ff). Moreover, on the subject of Bengal, Fitzedward Hall wrote in 1868 that \u0026rsquo;ntil very recently, the learned Bengali has long been satisfied, substantially, to do without the Veda\u0026rsquo; (cited in Kejariwal 1988: 3). A strange state of affairs, suggesting that brahmins didn\u0026rsquo;t really know what Europeans were talking about when they enquired about their sacred books. Even more, those who did seem to know about the texts didn\u0026rsquo;t seem to understand them. Regarding their secret language, Abbé Dubois, for example, had the following observation to make:\nIt is true…that those who devote themselves to the study of these books (the Vedas) cannot hope to extract any instruction from them, for they are written in ancient Sanskrit, which has become almost wholly unintelligible; and such numberless mistakes have been introduced by copyists, either through carelessness or ignorance, that the most learned find themselves quite unable to interpret the original text. Out of 20,000 brahmins I do not believe that one could be found who even partially understood the real Vedas .\nWhat Dubois saw was not the exception but the rule. When talking of the prayers in the Vedas, Horace Hayman Wilson discovered that they were hardly studied at all. Besides, \u0026lsquo;when they are studied it is merely for the sake of repeating the words; the sense is regarded as a matter of no importance, and is not understood even by the Brahman who recites or chants the expressions\u0026rsquo; (1840: 49).\nThere were other elements as well that did not fit the picture of a class of priests that controlled the laity through the corruption of original beliefs. Wilson, for example, felt it necessary to nuance Jones\u0026rsquo; views as based on Manu\u0026rsquo;s text, stating that brahmins were not \u0026lsquo;in great measure the ghostly advisers of the people…This office is now filled by various persons…Many of these are brahmans, but they are not necessarily so, and it is not as brahmans that they receive the veneration of their lay followers…\u0026rsquo; (1832: 311).\nHowever, when Indian intellectuals began to write their own story, they did not start from those experiences. Neither did they try to make them intelligible: India, as they saw it, had its own religion of priests and the hierarchy of caste system was due to priestly despotism. The implication of this account is the unconditional acceptance of Christianity\u0026rsquo;s theological conception of religion by Indian intellectuals.\nConclusion and Coda\nThe Orientalist-Anglicist distinction is said to have had a decisive influence on the outset of Indian reform movements. Mainly in Bengal, Indian intellectuals began to discover what orientalists had shown them: a golden age in a history of decline. It is said that exclusively due to orientalists, Indians became aware of original scripts and pure religions, of morality and virtue in a long distant past. It is also said that orientalists and anglicists differed in their assessment of Indian society. However, we have tried to show that despite these differences, the opposite camps shared the same conceptions of brahmins in India tout court: the Christian-theological themes that structured christianity\u0026rsquo;s own understanding of the religious and nurtured the attacks against the priesthood in Europe during the reformation, re-emerged in the explanation of contemporary Indian society. Therefore, if what we have suggested in this article is true, it follows that whenever Roy, Ambedkar or the people who are inspired by them accept Europe\u0026rsquo;s conceptualisations, they are not criticising their cultural inheritance at all. They are just repeating christianity\u0026rsquo;s critique against the pagan \u0026lsquo;priests\u0026rsquo;. It is also clear that the so-called differences between anglicist and orientalists are themselves dependent upon the same Judeo-Christian conception of religion and are, therefore, distinctions which make sense within a theological framework only. From this perspective the anglicist was correct in saying that corruption was there from the very beginning – after all, it was a pagan worship inspired by the devil. But the orientalists – working within the same theological background – were correct too when they stressed that compared to the original books, in which sound conceptions of the divine could still be found, these insights were lost due to a mounting corruption of the priests ever since.\nWhen contemporary scholars take this divide as a valuable structuring framework for describing the history of modern India they end up being theologians in a secular guise (see Balagangadhara 1994 for an amplification of this theme). That this framework makes sense after all could be explained by de-christianised Christianity being part of the history of the west, and, hence, being constitutive of the west\u0026rsquo;s cultural and religious experience. However, when Indian intellectuals take the same story for granted, they end up repeating a protestant Christian theme without Christianity being fundamental to the construction of the Indian culture. What they say must, therefore, be vacuous to a double extent. That they keep repeating the west in endless mantras of anti-brahmanism is not only puzzling, it is tragic as well. They do not only stop thinking, they are bereft of their own experience. The world of the west will never be theirs while the world of their own is no longer accessible due to the western mantras which prevent them from seeing and reflecting upon their own experience. Therefore, if a novel and innovating step towards a different approach of Indian culture is desirable and sought after, it is high time that the Indian intellectuals start taking their colonial experience seriously.\nReferences\nAmbedkar, B (1917): \u0026lsquo;Castes in India.

The dispute about the value of this idea to contemporary India is no longer confined to the academic circles. Politicians, journalists and others have strong views on the topic. Secularism regularly surfaces in newspaper articles, speeches and public meetings. The critics of the idea, however, are not often taken seriously at the theoretical level. The proponents of secularism dismiss all objections against their pet idea as misguided. Critics are either considered to be naive obscurantists, who dream of a return to a romantic image of Indian traditional society; or they are condemned as Hindu fundamentalists, who resist modern secular values and strive for a Hindu religious state.\nThough the secularists are genuinely concerned about the tensions currently disrupting Indian society, their fight for secularism has not been very effective when it comes to putting an end to \u0026ldquo;the Hindu-Muslim strife.\u0026rdquo; In fact, the Nehruvian secularism of the first few decades of the independent Indian state appears to have had as its long-term result an upsurge – rather than a decline – of intercommunity conflict. The problem I will address is to account for the stubborn adherence to the value of secularism among the Indian intellectuals, in spite of this spectacular failure. This adherence seems based in dogmatism, rather than in rational, critical or scientific argument. To account for this state of affairs, I will first turn to the history of the idea of secularism and show the deep roots it has in the religious doctrine of the Christian West. Next, I will analyze the role it has played in the colonial domination over the subcontinent and its intellectuals. The idea of secularism has been one of the backbones of the colonial educational project, which approached India as a backward society in need of conversion to modern western values.\nThese two steps bring me to the conclusion that the Indian secularists are today sustaining the colonial stance towards their own culture and society. They presuppose that the modern value of secularism or toleration is the superior way of organizing a plural society. Given this assumption, they easily come to the conclusion that India should adopt this value like all other modern nation-states. This is not an exhibition of human scientific rationality, but rather an instance of the fallacy of petitio principii. That is, the secularists take as a presupposition what they actually have to prove: the superiority of the modern value of secularism. The consequences are dramatic. Alternatives to secularism – e.g., the \u0026ldquo;traditional\u0026rdquo; ways of living together as they have developed on the subcontinent – are not even taken seriously as solutions to the predicament of pluralism in twenty-first-century India. Anyone who dares challenge this supreme value is classified as a naive conservative, a Hindu communalist, or worse. Thus, secularism limits the options of the Indian intellectuals to two equally flawed positions: either one continues the colonialism of the last three centuries through a dogmatic adherence to \u0026ldquo;modern secular values;\u0026rdquo; or one fights this stance on its own terms by becoming an \u0026ldquo;anti-modern\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;anti-western\u0026rdquo; or even \u0026ldquo;anti-scientific\u0026rdquo; fanatic.\nFortunately, there is a way out of this dilemma. It is to be found in the old human pursuit of knowledge. At a time when societies all around the world are becoming more diverse, we have to be ready to re-examine our long-standing ideas about pluralism and tolerance. More than ever, the search for scientific solutions to the problems of humankind should direct itself at the knowledge developed in the non-western world. The ways of living together of several Asian cultures have proven successful at creating a relative stability and harmony in extremely plural societies. Therefore, I argue, we should set up a massive enterprise to examine the nature and the success of these alternative ways of living together.\n1. A Modern Christian Value?\nA recent exchange in the Indian weekly Outlook revealed some of the damage done by colonialism to the Indian intellectuals and their understanding of secularism. It started with an opinion piece by Kuldip Nayar, who criticised Ashis Nandy\u0026rsquo;s views on secularism (Outlook, May 31, 2004). Nandy\u0026rsquo;s reply, \u0026ldquo;a Billion Gandhis\u0026rdquo; (June 21, 2004), restated his critique of secularism as \u0026ldquo;a dry import\u0026rdquo; from the West unable to find roots in the Indian soil. This in its turn lead to a vitriolic reaction by the historian Sanjay Subrahmanyam (July 5, 2004). The latter accused Nandy of being ignorant of European history. The word \u0026ldquo;secularism,\u0026rdquo; Subrahmanyam suggested, has never been all that important in western politics. It has acquired \u0026ldquo;a deep meaning and significance\u0026rdquo; in India, which it never had in Europe. Therefore, it is ridiculous to call secularism an imported idea. Nandy, he concluded, keeps on repeating his views only because he is \u0026ldquo;profoundly ill informed\u0026rdquo; about the history of concepts. Neither the derogatory language used by Subrahmanyam nor his impressive career in the European academia should blind us to his own lack of understanding of the western history of ideas. Unlike what he thinks, the main problem in the Indian secularism debate does not lie in the fact that a thinker like Nandy has not studied European history. Rather, it is rooted in the way Indian scholars have blindly adopted the self image of the Europeans.\nTo deny that secularism is an export from the West to India, one cannot simply repeat the old story about the British thinkers who coined the term in the nineteenth century, and the way its meaning changed in India. Secularism is not just a word; it is an idea. As an idea it has a long history going back to medieval times, but it is as alive as ever in the nation-states of the contemporary West. European intellectuals and politicians may prefer to use terms such as \u0026ldquo;toleration,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;state neutrality\u0026rdquo;,\u0026ldquo;laïcité\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;de lekenstaat\u0026rdquo;, or \u0026ldquo;Toleranz.\u0026quot; However, like \u0026ldquo;secularism,\u0026rdquo; these terms refer to a number of norms and values regarding the way a plural society and its state should be organised. The basic idea is that the state and its laws ought not to mingle with the realm of religion. The state should be secular, that is, its laws cannot be based in one or another religion. Today, this idea is presented as the one rational and democratic ideal for all human societies. Like liberal democracy, the secular humanists believe, this political salvation for the humankind should be exported to India and other plural countries.\nFortunately, we have independent thinkers like Ashis Nandy, who challenge the universal value of this idea. He suggests we would better look into the traditional ways of living together on the subcontinent, before we impose the barren idea of secularism on the cities and villages of India. And a barren idea it is. How and why it is so will not become clear by studying European history through the standard framework developed by the western intellectuals. This might make for Indian academics who share the assumptions, the vocabulary, and the pretences of their colleagues at Oxford or Harvard. But it does not produce significant insights into the encounter between India and the West.\nThe idea of secularism or toleration has become as barren as it is today, because it has been detached from the religious background that made it significant and fruitful. In order to get a grasp on its history, we first have to understand the Christian theological framework from which it emerged. Early in the history of Christianity, the belief became dominant that the human world is split into two different realms. On the one hand, there is the spiritual realm. Each human individual has a soul, Christian doctrine claimed, and this soul should become as spiritual as possible. That is, it should turn away from \u0026ldquo;the carnal world\u0026rdquo; in which we live and towards \u0026ldquo;the spiritual world\u0026rdquo; of God. In this eternal spiritual realm, the Holy Spirit operated and it regenerated the human soul so as to convert it to Christ. This realm was opposed to the temporal carnal realm. Each individual also consisted of a body – \u0026ldquo;the sinful flesh,\u0026rdquo; as Christian thinkers liked to call it. This sinful body lives here on earth in the temporal carnal realm, which is ruled by Satan – \u0026ldquo;the lord of this world.\u0026rdquo; From Augustine to Aquinas, all of the dominant political thought in Christian Europe took this two-fold division of human society as its starting-point.\nThen happened the Protestant Reformation of the sixteenth century – a cultural revolution that shaped the modern western culture. Its reform was also based in the opposition between the spiritual (or religious) world and the temporal (or secular) world. But it changed the relationship between the two worlds dramatically. Whereas the spiritual and the temporal had been equated with the clergy and the laity in the medieval Church, the Protestants claimed there was no such hierarchical division of humanity. There could not be a spiritual estate of priests as opposed to a temporal estate of laymen. All human beings lived in these two worlds at the same time. And all human souls should be left free to be regenerated by the Spirit of God. This gave rise to the entrenched normative belief that the state and its laws ought not to intrude upon religion. The Protestant thinkers asserted that one human being could not compel others as to what to believe and how to worship God, since \u0026ldquo;God alone was the Lord of our souls.\u0026rdquo; In theological terms, they said the following: (a) all human beings live in two spheres, the spiritual (or religious) and the temporal (or secular); (b) in the religious sphere, they strive for the salvation of their souls, and this is a purely individual affair over which God alone has authority; (c) in the secular sphere, they are bodies who pursue the preservation of their earthly interests, and here they should always obey the laws of the secular authorities. This was the Protestant theological framework within which thinkers like John Locke and Pierre Bayle elaborated their theories of toleration and liberty of conscience. The same religious motivation brought Thomas Jefferson to the famous claim that there should be \u0026ldquo;a wall of separation\u0026rdquo; between church and state. As he wrote in his letter to the Danbury Baptist Association, dated January 1, 1802:\n\u0026ldquo;Believing with you that religion is a matter which lies solely between Man \u0026amp; his God, that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship, that the legitimate powers of government reach actions only, and not opinions, I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should \u0026ldquo;make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,\u0026rdquo; thus building a wall of separation between Church \u0026amp; State.\u0026rdquo;\nThis Protestant doctrine remains the implicit background of the contemporary political theories of liberal toleration in the West. The idea of secularism or toleration is dependent on a number of deep-seated Christian assumptions concerning the nature and the aim of the human life. It takes the conceptual schemes of Christian theology – more specifically, its division of the world into a spiritual religious sphere and a temporal political sphere – as though these correspond to the universal structure of human societies. Moreover, secularism suggests that plural societies will fall apart, if they fail to adopt the Protestant norm of separation of the religious and the political.\nNaturally, this does not fit in with the story mainstream scholars like to tell about European history. This is the case, because they have accepted the West\u0026rsquo;s self-understanding – in which it is supposed to have released itself from Christian religious dogma at the time of the Enlightenment. This story is part of the mythology built by the western culture to claim for itself a grandiose place in human history. Earlier, it was the religion of Christianity that was to grant spiritual salvation to all peoples crowding the earth. Nowadays, it is the \u0026ldquo;secular\u0026rdquo; modernity of the West, which should bring political salvation to all cultures and societies. In between, the main change has been the shift from an explicitly religious language to a new \u0026ldquo;secular\u0026rdquo; vocabulary, which also claims to be \u0026ldquo;universal\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;rational\u0026rdquo; (this point is argued extensively by S.N. Balagangadhara in his \u0026ldquo;The Heathen in His Blindness …\u0026rdquo;: Asia, the West, and the Dynamic of Religion (E.J. Brill, 1994); a new edition by Manohar Publishers).\n2. Secularism and the Colonial Project\nIf the history of ideas proves that secularism is a Christian idea, why then have so many Indian intellectuals appropriated it as the norm to be attained by the Indian state and its citizens? This question becomes all the more pertinent once we are aware of the many theoretical shortcomings of the concept of secularism. For instance, as I have argued elsewhere, we do not possess a scientific framework today that allows us to distinguish the religious from the secular or the political. We do not even have a clue as to what makes the Hindu traditions into religion. All we have is vague and useless definitions of the word \u0026ldquo;religion,\u0026rdquo; which do not offer us any understanding of the phenomenon of religion. Still, we keep on saying that \u0026ldquo;the religious\u0026rdquo; should be separated from \u0026ldquo;the political\u0026rdquo; or that the state ought to be \u0026ldquo;secular\u0026rdquo; and not \u0026ldquo;religious\u0026rdquo; as though it were eminently clear what distinguished these spheres. Without providing any convincing argument, the secularists never cease to preach that \u0026ldquo;secularism should be revived in India\u0026rdquo; (see my \u0026ldquo;The Vacuity of Secularism,\u0026rdquo; in the Economic and Political Weekly, September 28, 2002, pp. 4047-4053).\nThe danger is that this critique of secularism is mistaken for a justification of \u0026ldquo;the Hindu religious state\u0026rdquo; in India. But this is not at all implied by my argument. Rather, the suggestion is that the conceptual distinction between \u0026ldquo;the religious\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;the secular\u0026rdquo; does not help us to understand Indian society and that the norm of secularism does not help us to alleviate the inter-community tensions of this society. Still, a bizarre but often-heard reply suggests that this is equivalent to rooting for a Hindu state. In other words, the secularists assume that any deviation from – or opposition to – secularism amounts to \u0026ldquo;religious fundamentalism.\u0026rdquo; To understand where this comes from, we have to reveal the role played by the idea of secularism in the colonial educational project.\nDuring its \u0026ldquo;golden age\u0026rdquo; in the nineteenth century, western colonialism presented itself as an educational project, which claimed to bring native societies to the developmental stage of the modern West and its \u0026ldquo;scientific values.\u0026rdquo; Colonial education intended to reveal to the colonized how backward they actually were. It either assumed implicitly or claimed explicitly that the practices, stories and traditions of the indigenous cultures had to be replaced by the law and order of western civilization. As S.N. Balagangadhara shows in a forthcoming article (\u0026ldquo;Colonialism, Colonial Consciousness, and Political Theory\u0026rdquo;), this stance makes colonialism into an immoral phenomenon. This is the case because of the following reasons: (a) Like all educational projects, colonialism tries to transform the experience of the colonized. It does so by replacing the cultural experience of the colonized with western colonial descriptions of his or her own culture and of the West. (b) But, the latter accounts have never been proven to be cognitively superior to the indigenous accounts. Instead, the colonial descriptions presuppose the superiority of the western culture and from this they conclude that the colonized culture must be inferior to that of the West. (c) The consequence is that fallacious colonial accounts, which beg the question as to the superiority of the West, are imposed on the colonized. As these accounts are not cognitively superior to those of the colonized, the use of violence becomes inevitable in this process of indoctrination. The colonizer does not have cogent arguments, so he is forced to take recourse to other means. Therefore, colonialism cannot be an educational project, though it claims to be that. In reality, it consists of a vicious circle that takes the \u0026ldquo;modern western values\u0026rdquo; as the beginning and end of human civilization.\nBalagangadhara\u0026rsquo;s account of the immorality of colonialism is well illustrated by the imposition of secularism on the Indian people. When the British missionaries, travelers and colonial administrators described Indian society, it was self-evident to them that this society was suffused by religion, albeit a false one. The \u0026ldquo;Hindoo religion\u0026rdquo; and, to a lesser extent, its \u0026ldquo;Mahometan\u0026rdquo; rival were said to determine every sphere of life and action. In India, no distinction was made between the political and the religious, so the colonials asserted: in fact, religion was consistently abused for political ends and the state took the form of a pernicious theocracy. Naturally, this description was implicitly opposed to the modern West. In the European self-image, the Reformation and the Enlightenment had demonstrated that toleration and the separation of church and state were the necessary conditions of civilized coexistence among religious groups. This self-image also shaped the image of India: if the political was not separated from the religious here, destructive conflict would inevitably erupt between the Hindus and the Muslims. Obviously, the Europeans thought, the Indians could not attain this insight by themselves. Colonial schooling had to educate them in the virtues of modern secularism. The Indian elite – created by this educational system – adopted the view of India as a caste-ridden society living under the tyranny of religion. It embraced the colonial description, which was founded on the presupposition of the superiority of the western civilization. The results were a Raja Rammohan Roy in the nineteenth century and a Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru in the twentieth.\nA few steps can be discerned in the process of intellectual colonization that shaped these \u0026ldquo;makers of modern India.\u0026rdquo; Firstly, the Indian elite accepted the terms of description of the western colonials as though these were scientific. This could happen because the colonial educational system put these fallacious descriptions of caste and religion in India at par with the accounts of Newtonian physics and other scientific theories. Thus, the elite began to conceptualize Indian society in terms of the division between \u0026ldquo;the religious\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;the secular\u0026rdquo; (or \u0026ldquo;the political\u0026rdquo;), even though this conceptual distinction was rooted in Christian dogma. Secondly, the conception of the subcontinent as an inferior civilization brought about the conviction that India should become like Europe. In the present case, this meant that the state ought to steer clear from \u0026ldquo;the Hindu religion,\u0026rdquo; just as church and state had been separated in Europe. Politics ought to be based in \u0026ldquo;modern secular values,\u0026rdquo; that is, in the norms of nineteenth- and twentieth-century western Christendom. The third step made this normative order into the one viable alternative to inter-community conflict. Without these values, the story went, India would eventually be reduced to chaos and violence. The language of secularism became the only vocabulary in which a stable and harmonious plural society could be imagined. In other words, peace and order in society were conflated with a particular normative description of the way in which \u0026ldquo;India ought to be secular.\u0026rdquo; The final step caused a similar change in the identification of the problems and tensions of Indian society. The colonial descriptions of the inferiority of India became the standard textbook stories on this \u0026ldquo;backward, caste-ridden and fossilized civilization, permeated by irrational religion and blind ritual.\u0026rdquo; Again, this specific description was equated with the very structure of Indian society and its problems.\nThe outcome of this process is the dead end we have reached today. The current tensions in the fabric of Indian society can be conceptualized in one way alone, it seems: these are \u0026ldquo;the predicaments of caste, communalism, and religious conflict.\u0026rdquo; Thus, a particular description of certain phenomena continues to be conflated with these phenomena themselves (viz., the tensions among different communities in India). The distinction is ignored between a description and the phenomena it describes. When such constraints are put on the identification of a problem, these will also operate on the solutions that are developed. As a consequence, according to this view, the one supreme virtue India needs today is secularism. As Salman Rushdie once put it: \u0026ldquo;Secularism, for India, is not simply a point of view, it is a question of survival.\u0026rdquo; This value is seen as the safeguard of peace, order and sanity in society. In the absence of secularism, India is bound to fall apart, so our colonial intuition tells us. Therefore, this point of view transforms any critic of the idea of secularism into a proponent of communalism, fundamentalism, theocracy, caste, inequality, and other evils.\n3. Ways of Living Together\nThe time has come to move beyond the constraints of this colonial stance. India does not need secularism for its survival. Hindus, Muslims, Christians and several other groups were quite successful at living together in relative peace for a long period of time in India. This plural society did not fall apart. Yet, it had never even heard of \u0026ldquo;secularism\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;toleration.\u0026rdquo; Therefore, the task ahead is to examine the ways of living together as they have emerged in various regions of India. In what remains, I will briefly consider two strategies that have been dominant in the search for alternatives to the modern western value of secularism. These strategies, I think, have had a harmful impact on this quest.\nThe first is the anti-modern and anti-scientific stance we find among some Gandhians, including Nandy. Considering what has happened to the world after the rise of industrialism, capitalism and modern technology in the West, this negative attitude towards science and technology is understandable. The problem, however, is that it takes a particular conception of science, its role in society and its value to humanity as though this is the only way to think about science. It confuses science with the western story on \u0026ldquo;modern scientific values.\u0026rdquo; However, one does not have to accept the latter story in order to appreciate and adopt the cognitive criteria developed by the natural sciences in the last few centuries. Science has given us the heuristics to attain reliable theoretical knowledge about the world. These heuristics and criteria of scientific knowledge cannot be thrown overboard in the search for alternatives to secularism. Rather, our hypotheses and theories on the traditional ways of living together in Indian society will be most fruitful when they share the characteristic features of any scientific hypothesis: refutable, refinable, coherent, and internally consistent. In the same way as the richest natural-scientific theories we possess today, they should have empirical consequences, strive for clarity of terms and identify the structures and mechanisms behind the phenomena. In this manner, our alternative theories of pluralism and co-existence among various religious and cultural groups will be able to outshine the normative dogmas of secularism.\nThe second strategy takes recourse to the widespread belief that the Indian traditions have their own doctrine of \u0026ldquo;Hindu secularism\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Hindu tolerance,\u0026rdquo; which surpasses that of western secularism. Both the proponents of Hindutva and many Gandhians claim that the innate belief in the equality of all religions has allowed all kinds of religious traditions to co-exist peacefully in the past, and that it will continue to do so in the future. This claim is easily refuted. The belief that all religions are equal cannot possibly be accepted by Muslim and Christian believers. The very foundation of Islam and Christianity suggests that these religions are the unique revelation of God – the Creator and Sovereign of the universe. Therefore, they have to distinguish between themselves as the true religion and all others as false religions. All religions cannot be equal, according to the religions of Muslims and Christians. Nevertheless, in past centuries, various communities of these two religions were part of the relatively peaceful and harmonious co-existence of Indian society. They lived side by side with Vaishnava, Jaina, Virashaiva, Buddhist and other groups, while they ceased to take part in systematic persecution, religious violence and aggressive proselytization. This cannot be explained in terms of a shared belief in the equality of all religions. Therefore, this story on the doctrine of \u0026ldquo;Hindu tolerance\u0026rdquo; does not help us to understand the Indian mode of pluralism.\nHow, then, could we go about examining the ways of living together of the Indian culture? Let us have a closer look at these phenomenona. On the one hand, we have the \u0026ldquo;internal\u0026rdquo; pluralism of the Hindu traditions. Although there were clashes among these traditions, these never developed into the systematic persecution of some particular tradition or the other. Alongside these clashes, there was a tendency in each of these traditions to absorb or adopt elements from the other traditions. On the other hand, we have the interaction among these Hindu traditions and the religions of Islam and Christianity, which reveals the same kind of pattern. Again there were violent clashes, but Muslims and Christians were not assaulted or persecuted because of their religious beliefs or their worship of Allah/God. On the contrary, the Hindu traditions had no qualms about the adoption of Jesus Christ, the Virgin Mary, or the prophet Mohammed as avatars. They would even include these new characters in their puja\u0026rsquo;s. Hindus joined Muslims in showing reverence at the dargahs of the Sufi pirs, or in the celebration of Muharram. Moreover, the initial intolerance of the Muslim invaders and Christian converts towards the \u0026ldquo;idolatry\u0026rdquo; of the Hindus soon disappeared from local Islamic and Christian traditions. Indian Muslims and Christians participated in Hindu festivals and revered some of the Hindu gods. They made contributions to traditions of Hindu literature, music, and painting – often adding Islamic or Christian elements. Importantly, the proselytizing drive of both Islam and Christianity was tempered to a large extent in their local manifestations on the Indian subcontinent.\nThe current explanations of these phenomena share a basic assumption: there must be a common framework – a shared set of values – which allowed these diverse groups to live together. To grant plausibility to this background assumption, one would have to identify this constitutive set of values shared by the different communities. The single candidate today is the account of Hindu tolerance, which says that these communities were able to live together because they all accepted the equality of religions. We have already confronted one flaw in this account. Another flaw concerns the Hindu traditions themselves: it is often pointed out that one cannot identify any one belief, doctrine, or principle on which they all agree. Still, if one explains the fact that these traditions did not persecute each other or Islam and Christianity in terms of a common principle of Hindu tolerance, one will have to show that they all shared this principle. But there is no proof for the claim that all of these traditions endorsed some orthodox Hindu belief that \u0026ldquo;all religions are equal\u0026rdquo; or that \u0026ldquo;the truth is one but can have plural manifestations,\u0026rdquo; besides the fact that they did not engage in systematic persecution. It seems that this explanation presupposes that there must be a common principle of tolerance, which has enabled the different traditions to live together. Consequently, one looks for such a principle in the \u0026ldquo;sacred texts of Hinduism,\u0026rdquo; and one finds it in the Sanskrit aphorism \u0026ldquo;Ekam Satya, Viprah Bahudah Vadanti\u0026rdquo; from the Rig-Veda, which is presented as the basic doctrine of Hindu tolerance.\nCould there have been another framework of values that was shared by the various communities – which we are yet to discover? This is unlikely. It would have to be an extremely complex system of values not only to allow co-existence, but also to cause the different communities to absorb elements and attitudes from each other\u0026rsquo;s traditions, and to participate in each other\u0026rsquo;s practices. The question then is what has enabled the various Hindu traditions to co-exist with each other, and with others? What explains the peculiar interplay of vigorous clashes and mutual exchanges among these traditions? How come the local Islamic and Christian traditions interacted with the Hindu traditions in a similar way? At the Research Centre Vergelijkende Cultuurwetenschap at Ghent University, we are currently examining an alternate route to answer these fascinating questions. The route suggests that different communities were able to build a reasonably stable and harmonious society, not because they agreed on a common framework, but because they developed a specific way of going about with each other. This plural Indian society did and does not revolve around a shared belief in some set of values or in the norm of secularism – rather it hinges on a set of practices and attitudes that has allowed the various communities to live together. Our future work will analyse the mechanisms of these ways of going about.\nLet me end by paying tribute to the main partisan of anti-secularism in India, Ashis Nandy. As he once pointed out in a pithy metaphor, secularism limits the options of humankind dramatically: it is either Coca-Cola or Ayathollah Khomeini. Though this may be a hyperbole, the image illustrates the constraints the story of \u0026ldquo;modern secularism\u0026rdquo; has imposed on our thinking about the problems of pluralism in India. Either secularism or violence. We should heed the insight of Nandy\u0026rsquo;s anti-secularist manifestos: chaos and violence will not erupt when we leave behind the barren idea of secularism. It is a pity this proposition can still lead to bitter retorts like that of Subrahmanyam. Naturally, as the historian points out, one should practice what one preaches in this matter and truly examine the nature and the history of Indian pluralism. To do so, however, a climate needs to be created that stimulates and sustains such research projects. Rather than singing the mantras of secularism, the academic world should provide a fertile soil for innovative research into the co-existence of communities in India. In more general terms, we are confronting a fundamental question: What direction should the Indian social sciences take today? Should they continue to gather empirical details that merely serve to sustain the intellectual colonialism of the West? Or should they move into exciting new fields where our current understanding of human beings and societies may be turned upside down?\n","tags":[],"title":"Secularism, Colonialism and Indian Intellectuals","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/secularism-colonialism-and-indian-intellectuals/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","published","review"],"content":"Review of Imaging Hinduism: A Postcolonial perspective. By Sharada Sugirtharajah. Routledge, 2003. 164 pages\nThis book is the first of its kind to bring post-colonial perspectivesinto a study of Hinduism. Consequently, there are no conventionalreference points for the author to use to build her narrative. She has to figure out how to use the conceptual apparatus ofthe one to study the other. In this sense, although the bookis experimental in its nature, there is nothing hesitant ortentative about some of the conclusions she draws. How successfulis the author in bringing the two, the study of Hinduism anda post-colonial perspective, together? If someone is influencedby post-colonial thought, the judgment will have to be in thepositive. However, having never been enamored by this genreof thinking, I find her framework both limiting and damagingto the study of Hinduism. Before I identify some of my problems,a few words about the book are necessary.\nEach chapter conveniently divides into two recognizable parts:one part where the author tells her narrative and the otherin which she explains in a transparent way the basic conceptsshe uses in the course of that chapter. Admirably free of jargon,which is definitely not one of the virtues of post-colonialwritings, the author succinctly explains the meaning and useof some of the crucial concepts of this genre of thinking andwriting in one part of each chapter. In the other, she plotsthe trajectories pursued by of some of the colonial writerson Hinduism.\nTo the students of Hinduism, the figures talked about are relativelyfamiliar: William Jones, Max Müller, William Ward and JohnFarquhar. Each is given a full chapter and the discussion oftheir ideas is rich and nuanced but, ultimately, unsatisfactory.In the last chapter, she takes up one of the aspects that agitateall those who study Hinduism: the practice of sati, the practiceof burning widows on the funeral pyres of their husbands.\nIn the introduction, the author lays out her project and herambition: \u0026ldquo;This volume aims to show how Hinduism came to betailored to fit the varied hermeneutical and ideological positionsof both western and Indian interpreters, all of whom, on theirown terms, tried to homogenize a loosely knit tradition, andinvest it with a tight structure, thereby making it static;fixed and palatable\u0026rdquo; (ix, italics mine). This theme is the leitmotiv:homogenization of a tradition which makes it static. In thecase of each of the authors she treats, she tries to demonstratethe tropes and the strategies they use to achieve this goalwithout, however, really appreciating the cognitive significanceof the question that is never far away from her consciousness:Why did they want to try and homogenize a tradition? In thecase of Jones, a \u0026ldquo;part of his motive\u0026rdquo; lay in the \u0026ldquo;needs of thecolonial government\u0026rdquo; (22), but here, it is not a complete explanation(23). In the case of Max Müller, a speculative psychologyprovides the answer: \u0026ldquo;his own romantic quest for the lost originsof the European culture\u0026rdquo; (73). To William Ward, a Christian missionary, his evangelical longings provide the answer: he\u0026quot;essentializes, dramatizes and manipulates\u0026quot; (89) his descriptionof Hinduism to show the \u0026ldquo;superiority\u0026rdquo; of Protestant Christianity.Farquhar, despite his desire for an \u0026ldquo;empathetic understanding\u0026quot;of Hinduism, merely wants to show that Christianity is the fulfillmentof Hinduism.\nThere are two ways of looking at these explanations. One isto draw attention to the varied set of \u0026ldquo;motives.\u0026rdquo; However, indoing so, one is merely trying to hide the fact of indulgingin some very bad arm-chair psychologising. There is no way onearth that one could demonstrate or \u0026ldquo;prove\u0026rdquo; the individual psychologicalmotives on the basis of their writings, whether they are booksor personal letters. Even if one can provide some plausibilityto such a speculation, what, if any, is the relation betweena theory and the psychological motive of an author? Unless thisquestion can be satisfactorily answered, the answers are totallyad hoc. And that is the second way of looking at such explanations:they are ad hoc and do not further the cause of knowledge. Onecould as well say that the traveler\u0026rsquo;s diarrhea inflictedJones, which is why he could never forgive the natives. Why would this speculation be any less acceptable than the \u0026ldquo;administrativeneeds\u0026rdquo; of the British East India Company?\nIn fact, there are two major challenges facing any study suchas this one: one set of challenges arises from the subject matter;the other set has its origins in the limitations of post-colonialthought. Let me begin with the last.\nThe first and the most obvious problem is about the usefulnessof a post-colonial perspective. What precisely is the theoreticalgain of using such a perspective? Apart from simply statingthat \u0026ldquo;knowledge is bound to power\u0026rdquo; or that one uses the tropeof a \u0026ldquo;child\u0026rdquo; to describe the Indian civilization to show the\u0026quot;superiority\u0026rdquo; of the western culture and civilization, thereare no other cognitive advantages. The disadvantages, by contrast,are many. Each claim from a post-colonial perspective generatesso many questions that cry out for an answer that it is simplyamazing to see them done away with some cliché from thearsenal. Consider just a random selection of questions thata few of the chapters raise. It is indeed a fact that the Britishwere very keen to discover the original legal texts from theIndian traditions and codify them. But why were they so keento do so? It could not be because of their \u0026ldquo;administrative needs.\u0026ldquo;The Islamic colonial rule was in place for centuries beforethat, and these rulers did not codify legal texts for their\u0026quot;administrative needs.\u0026rdquo; Why, then, could the British not followthe Mogul example? Or again, the Protestant evangelical needto show the \u0026ldquo;superiority\u0026rdquo; of Protestant Christianity was nowhereequal to the Muslim belief in the superiority of Islam or thelatter\u0026rsquo;s drive to convert the Kaffirs. Why, then, didthe West do what the Muslims never did, namely try and understandHinduism by \u0026ldquo;imaginatively constructing\u0026rdquo; it?\nConsider a different kind of question that emerges from thelast chapter: the need to defend or attack the practice of burningthe widows on the funeral pyres of their husbands by referringto the scriptural sanction for this practice. If we follow thedetails of this debate in colonial India, there is one staggeringfact that cries out for an explanation. The British did notban this practice straightaway, whatever their denominationalaffiliations, but sought instead to find out whether the Indianscriptures sanctified it. I know of no single instance of anyBritish official condoning it; without exception, they consideredit inhuman and barbaric. Nevertheless, they first wanted toknow what the Indian scriptures said of this practice. Why?Why did they not ban it straightaway? Surely, these questionscannot be answered by table thumping and hand waving in thedirection of \u0026ldquo;colonial exigencies.\u0026rdquo;\nIf anything, because Sharada Sugirtharajah does not raise oranswer these questions, she runs the risk of simplifying someof her criticisms to such an extent that they end up becomingridiculous. Let me take an example. One of her criticisms whichis also the standard diet in post-colonial thinking is the leitmotivof the book. There is no one homogenized \u0026ldquo;Hinduism\u0026rdquo; but merelymultiple, \u0026ldquo;loosely knit Hinduisms.\u0026rdquo; One does not need any philosophicalsophistication to realize that this standard criticism is completelyuntenable. There is nothing logically, linguistically, or evenphilosophically wrong in using \u0026ldquo;Hinduism\u0026rdquo; in the singular evenwhere the word refers to a multiplicity and plurality of phenomena.On the contrary, such use is absolutely essential. As homo Sapiens,we belong to a single species. However, by indicating that webelong to a single species, there is no suggestion anywherethat this species is either \u0026ldquo;monolithic\u0026rdquo; or that there is no\u0026quot;diversity.\u0026rdquo; To speak of \u0026ldquo;Hinduisms\u0026rdquo; in the plural, and to denyits singular use, is an expression of philosophical, logical,and linguistic illiteracy; it does not express any conceptualsophistication. The very possibility of \u0026ldquo;Hinduisms\u0026rdquo; making sensedepends on the guarantee that \u0026ldquo;Hinduism\u0026rdquo; makes sense.\nConcomitant to this post-colonial stance, a huge explanatoryproblem comes into existence. Why did generations of writersfrom the West fail to appreciate the multiplicity and complexityof Hinduism, if they indeed failed in appreciating this factso evident to every post-colonial writer? I am aware of the answers that float around, including the many ego-flatteringones. The problem with them is their ad hoc nature: they merelypick up some or another random difference between the past andthe present (lack of information, \u0026ldquo;wrong\u0026rdquo; philosophical presupposition,colonialism, etc) and simply postulate or allege a \u0026ldquo;causal\u0026quot;relationship.\nTo appreciate the absurdity of such \u0026ldquo;explanations\u0026quot;consider another random collection of such differences. Theearlier generations failed in appreciating the depth and complexityof \u0026ldquo;Hinduism\u0026rdquo; because: (a) Bush was not the president of theUnited States; (b) the X-Files had not yet been screened; (c)this reviewer was not yet born; (d) the European Union did nothave 25 member states . . . . Why does one random collection\u0026quot;explain\u0026rdquo; and not the other?\nI consider this question the biggest challenge and a litmustest to any and all studies into the history of Hinduism. Ifone is inclined to say that the earlier generations failed,the onus is on the claimant to come up with a reasoned \u0026ldquo;explanation\u0026quot;of such a failure without appealing to ad hoc arguments. Pointingat imperialism and colonialism and what have you is no answerunless one is able to show what the relationship is betweenthe one and the other. Here, the track record of post-colonial thought has been abysmal so far. If the author of this bookwas not blinded by this genre of thinking, she would have seenit as well.\nThe second problem that faces any and all attempts like thisbook is the relationship between the Christian theology andthe study of Hinduism. Increasingly, it is becoming acceptedthat the former has shaped the latter. But this insight merelyincreases the complexity of the task: those who criticize theearlier generations of thinkers in their failure and lay thisfailure at the doorstep of their Christian understanding needto exhibit a superior mastery in the field of Christian theologicaldiscussions as well. It is not sufficient anymore to merelynote that Max Müller was \u0026ldquo;influenced\u0026rdquo; by Protestant thinking.One has to show (a) not merely how and in what sense such aninfluence can be traced in his writings but also (b) more importantlywhat is wrong with that influence. What is wrong with the influenceexerted by the Protestant theology? To simply wave one\u0026rsquo;shands vaguely in the direction of \u0026ldquo;ideological\u0026rdquo; influence isto say and show nothing. The stakes merely go up: What indeedis wrong with ideological influences in the study of religion?Is one contrasting \u0026ldquo;science\u0026rdquo; with \u0026ldquo;ideology\u0026rdquo;? In which case,how does a \u0026ldquo;scientific\u0026rdquo; study of Hinduism look like?\nAlthough one cannot blame the author for not raising or answeringthese questions in this slim volume, I would have liked to knowwhether she is cognizant of these issues. Nothing in the booksuggests that she is; by the same token, nothing in the booksuggests that she is not. I hope she takes up these issues inher future research.\nQuite apart from these challenges, the nature of the subjectmatter raises other kinds of problems as well. The most obviouslacuna lies in the selection of the authors when the book isabout \u0026ldquo;Imagining Hinduism.\u0026rdquo; Quite apart from the fact that theseauthors are well-known figures in the British study of Hinduism,there is nothing else that brings them together in the confinesof a single volume. It is almost as though these authors, allon their own, came up with the constructions they did come up with. The rest of Europe simply plays no role in the narrativethat Sharada Sugirtharajah pens. Of course, there are explanationsfor this oversight; the most obvious one, perhaps, is the author\u0026rsquo;slack of mastery in other European languages. However, this hasbeen the bane of most Anglo-Saxon writings on this subject.The foundations, the frameworks, and even most of the contentfor these authors were prepared in Continental Europe first;it was in continental Europe that the work of the Asiatic Societyresonated first before it moved people in the British Isles.Even the schism in Christianity took place in continental Europefirst. If one is unable to bring the absolutely vital contributionsof the continental Europeans into the picture, our understandingof the \u0026ldquo;imaginative construction of Hinduism\u0026rdquo; will not merelybe poor; it will also be distorted and one-sided. It will be distorted because one of the hobbyhorses, the \u0026ldquo;exigencies ofthe British colonial rule\u0026rdquo; which is the \u0026ldquo;favorite\u0026rdquo; song of thepost-colonials, used to explain the construction of Hinduismwill bite dust. It will be one-sided because we will have nounderstanding why these earlier generations of scholars claimed what they did claim.\nCorrelated to the above problem is the absence of context. Thisis a kind of history writing that ends up denying intelligibilityto its subject matter. We have some big names, intellectualgiants of their time no doubt, floating in an intellectual vacuum.They appear to have no precedents, either in the commonsenseideas that floated around in their time or in the debates oftheir age. Consequently, both the questions confronting theseauthors and the answers they provide become unintelligible. Instead of a history of ideas that is supposed to help us understandthe nature and status of the study of Hinduism, the narrativeitself becomes an opaque puzzle. What were the intellectualand cognitive problems faced by the earlier generations of writers?Where did these problems emerge from? Not answering these questionsis to take away the crucial instrument we need to evaluate the adequacy of their answers.\nBy embracing the post-colonial perspective, I think SharadaSugirtharajah has done a great disservice to herself. Despitebeing eminently readable and thoroughly enjoyable, the bookis beset with problems inherited from her fascination for post-colonialthinking. However, despite this deficiency, I consider thisbook an indispensable companion to any classroom teaching ofHinduism. It goes further than the many textbooks on HinduismI know, and it provides a much needed correction to their representation of Hinduism. It would have been a very good contribution toa study of Hinduism, if the author did not force some avoidableproblems on the book. She will do better by getting off thebandwagon of post-colonial thinking and focusing on what sheseems to be good at: provide a rich and balanced reading ofthe original texts and contribute meaningfully to the much neededdebate on the nature and structure of Hinduism.\n","tags":[],"title":"Review of Imagining Hinduism","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/review-of-imagining-hinduism/"},{"categories":["india-forum","Jakob","NRI"],"content":"In years to come, the Indian community in the U.S. will face a major challenge from American pluralism. This is the first time a powerful community of pagans has to be accommodated within the American society. The NRI community is well-educated, well-to-do and proud of its cultural traditions. At the same time, the representation of the Indian traditions in the U.S. educational system shows a pathetic level of understanding. I will argue that recent events like the California textbook controversy point to a profound problem: the American model of pluralism is unable to accommodate these pagan traditions. This is the case, because its structure has emerged from a co-existence of Protestant denominations. Maximally, the resulting model could encompass other variants of the religions of the book: Catholicism, Judaism and Islam. Incorporating the pagan traditions of India, however, will require a fundamental rethinking of American pluralism.\nThe Structure of American Pluralism\nAlthough it aspires neutrality towards all religions, the American model of pluralism is deeply religious in nature. The model takes its basic structure from Protestant Christianity. It combines specific notions of \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;God\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;church\u0026rsquo; with a set of principles on toleration, equality and religious liberty\u0026ndash;all of which derive from a particular theology.\nThe predicament faced by early American society was relatively simple: how does one build a viable state when the subjects are devotees of a variety of Christian denominations\u0026rsquo; Since so many of the migrants were members of religious groups persecuted in Europe, no one church could ever dominate colonial America. After the revolution, the established churches that had existed in some states were soon compelled to give up their entanglement with state authority. They could no longer dismiss other groups as dissenters. Hence, the need and opportunity to create a new political system also involved a difficulty: how to house Presbyterians and \u0026lsquo;Papists\u0026rsquo;, Mennonites and Moravians, Anglicans and Baptists, Deists and Quakers, etc. without alienating any of these citizens?\nThe American solution drew heavily on the political thought of early modern Europe. The political thought in question, in its turn, was a sophisticated expression of a strand within the Protestant Reformation that also gave shape to American culture. Take John Locke\u0026rsquo;s theory of toleration. This theory was often invoked in revolutionary America, because it endorsed certain principles: the separation of civil and religious society; the voluntary nature of churches; and the liberty of conscience and worship, except where it poses a threat to civil society. These principles reproduced central notions of Reformation theology. More particularly, they built on the common belief that human existence is divided into a temporal or civil sphere, where all individuals ought to submit themselves to political authority, and a spiritual or religious sphere, where God alone could rule. Since this belief was part of the Protestant common sense of early America, the political principles that built on it would acquire the same status without much difficulty.\nWhat happened in the decades and centuries after the American Revolution could be characterized as a secularization of this theological framework. This secularization, however, did not result in the emancipation of rational values from Christianity or the extension of secular tenets to humanity. Rather, it constituted the diffusion and in many cases, the imposition of Christian principles in a secular guise. Instead of defending this hypothesis in terms of historical evidence, I will indicate some of its consequences with regards to the nature of American pluralism: the basic properties of this model make sense only for (and to) the biblical religions.\nIntrinsic to the American model is a specific notion of religion. In its original theological form, religion was seen as the duty and right of all human beings to worship their Creator in such a manner as they see fit. This Creator is none other than the biblical God: an eternal person without a body, who exists outside the universe and whose will creates and governs that same universe. Today, this notion of religion has become more abstract and less clear, but essentially religion is still viewed as the worship of God. The traditions of those people who do not follow any of the religions of the book are viewed as attempts to worship the same God. True, liberal Americans have tried to open up this biblical notion of God so as to include the many pagan deities. To this end, they invoke the concept of polytheism. However, the conceptual opposition between monotheism and polytheism has a hitch. \u0026lsquo;Theism\u0026rsquo; derives from the Greek word \u0026lsquo;theos\u0026rsquo;, commonly translated as \u0026lsquo;god\u0026rsquo;. The question, then, is to which object the \u0026lsquo;theos\u0026rsquo; in \u0026lsquo;mono-theism\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;poly-theism\u0026rsquo; refers. If it refers to \u0026lsquo;God\u0026rsquo; (the biblical god), the creator of the universe and the sovereign of the world, what does it mean to speak of \u0026lsquo;Gods\u0026rsquo; in the plural\u0026rsquo; Multiple creators of the universe and multiple sovereigns of the world\u0026rsquo; Hardly. The \u0026lsquo;gods\u0026rsquo; of the \u0026lsquo;polytheism\u0026rsquo; then, must necessarily refer to entities other than \u0026lsquo;God\u0026rsquo;, who is the Lord of the cosmos by virtue of being its creator. What kind of other \u0026lsquo;gods\u0026rsquo; could there be? One possibility is that the many deities of the pagan traditions are false gods. That is, these deities are falsely believed by the pagans to be the governing forces behind natural events, while in reality \u0026lsquo;God\u0026rsquo; (the biblical god) is the only sovereign of the universe. This is the classical story of biblical theology. In other words, the concept of polytheism makes sense only within a biblical framework.\nThe notion of religion of American pluralism has other important properties. It gives a central place to doctrine. That is, different religions are viewed as different sets of doctrines or beliefs. These doctrines are conceived as propositions about the nature of God (or gods), about His (or their) relation to humanity, and about the correct way of worshiping Him (or them). The practices of different religions are viewed as embodiments of doctrines: the followers of each religion strive to worship God (or gods) as its doctrine prescribes. Since they are propositions about the world, these doctrines also make competing truth claims.\nThe American model also entails a particular conception of churches or religious groups. These churches or religious groups are supposed to be united around the doctrines of some or another religion (or denomination). That is, the members of a church or religious group share core beliefs about God, His will and about human nature. Because of these shared beliefs, one individual or body can represent all other members of the church. They are given the authority to do so by the other members, because of theological proficiency or other capacities. In some cases, these individuals have the authority to represent others, because the doctrines of the religion in question impart them with this authority. But this is allowed by the legal model of American pluralism only in so far as the members of this church voluntarily subscribe to the doctrines and to the religious authority of the clergy. In other words, a church is a voluntary association and cannot be coercive in nature. At all times, every member possesses the right to exit. Any group of members can leave its original church and set up a new one. One is not born into a religion, but rather chooses to become part of it, when one reaches the age of religious consent.\nAll churches or religious groups should respect the division between political and religious society or the separation of church and state. That is, they ought not to aspire establishment or the status of state church. Neither should they attempt to interfere directly in state policy. At the same time, they also should not expect the state to intervene in any of their internal organizational matters. Each church or religious group ought to respect the doctrines and practices of other religions. In the public sphere, they should treat the other churches or communities as their equals, even if they consider these rivals to be theologically misguided. They ought to respect the religious liberty of the members of other churches or religious groups and should never prevent the latter from worshiping God.\nThe various normative principles of the American model make sense because they presuppose and build on these notions of religion, God and church. Firstly, the principle of toleration presupposes that there is something to be tolerated. That is, only where different religions are conceived as competing doctrines, does the question of toleration emerge. From this perspective, the differences between religions indeed become matters to be tolerated, since they correspond to different doctrines or beliefs whose truth is contested. Second, the principle of state neutrality also derives its importance from this understanding of religion as a question of truth. The different denominations or religious groups in society each hold a different set of doctrines to be true. Since the state ought to represent all of these groups impartially, it cannot subscribe to the truth of any of these doctrines. It should take a neutral position, which allows it to play the role of an impartial arbiter in the case of religious conflicts. In so far as the worship of each religious group is taken to embody its doctrines, the state should also not promote any one mode of worship over others. It ought never to interfere in any form of worship or religious practice, unless public order is at stake.\nThird, the principle of religious liberty would lose its significance in the absence of this conception of religion. Each religion takes itself to be the correct worship of God, since it holds the true doctrine. It is of the utmost significance to the members of a denomination to worship God in the way prescribed by their religion, because their salvation depends on this. Since God alone can judge and rule in the realm of religion, each human being ought to be left free in that realm. Religion is a matter between each believer and God. Therefore, religious liberty is an inviolable right of all citizens.\nFinally, all churches or religious groups should be equal in the eyes of the state. This also depends on the notion that a church is united around a common set of beliefs and therefore it can be represented by an individual or a body to whom has been given the authority to do so. Since the state cannot take a position on the matter of religious truth, public education should represent all religions equally, namely, as their followers want them to be represented. The textbooks and teachers of state schools should not disrespect the teachings of any religion or openly show signs of favor or disfavor. It is the duty and role of the representatives of each religious community to see to it that this principle of equality is not violated.\nThis model of pluralism make perfect historical sense: it addresses the problems that will always emerge where Protestant denominations co-exist. While each denomination believes itself to possess religious truth, all of them share a common understanding of religion, God and church. Together with a shared theological framework, the persistence of religious diversity compels them to endorse certain normative principles: toleration, state neutrality, religious liberty and the equality of churches in the public sphere. Since Roman Catholicism shares the same notion of God and religion, its followers are able to make sense of these principles. Once they agree to renounce the political authority of the pope and the coercive nature of the church, Catholics can be accommodated in this model without much difficulty. Mutatis mutandis, the same goes for Jews and Muslims. They might not endorse all of the above principles, but they can fit into the American model of pluralism, because their religions correspond to its basic theological structure. Historically, this is precisely what has happened during the formation of American pluralism.\nThe Nature of Pagan Traditions\nWhat happens when pagans enter the picture\u0026rsquo; Let us take the Hindu traditions as the example.\nFirst of all, the Hindu traditions do not fit into the notion of religion of the American model. They do not in any way revolve around the duty and right of all human beings to worship their Creator. The concept of God (the way the Bible \u0026lsquo;conceives\u0026rsquo; of this entity) is completely alien to them. Some theologians and scholars of India have undertaken clumsy attempts to argue that the Hindu traditions are aware of this God. They have tried to translate \u0026lsquo;Brahman\u0026rsquo; as \u0026lsquo;God\u0026rsquo; and see in these traditions a misguided attempt to worship the biblical god. The notion of polytheism reproduces the same view. In reality, however, the notion of God is absent in the Hindu traditions: there is no eternal person, whose will has created and governs the universe and who has revealed His true will to sections of humanity. Another problem is that the central place of doctrine in religion is as alien to the Hindu traditions. These traditions do not in any way revolve around propositions about the nature of gods or about their relation to humanity. There are no \u0026lsquo;doctrines\u0026rsquo; here. There are many stories about the devatas and their interaction with human and other beings. There are all types of ritual practices or pujas. There is a variety of adhyatmic and other traditions that intend to help different types of human beings to become happy. These include instructions for action that may help certain individuals to attain happiness. But the validity of these instructions depends on the extent to which they are helpful to an individual. Therefore, they should not be mistaken for doctrines, which can be either true or false. Naturally, Christian theologians and western scholars have done precisely that: the only way for them to make sense of these traditions is to construe them as doctrines. Needless to say, many Indian scholars reproduce these unintelligible ideas as though they are parrots.\nConsequently, a second mismatch occurs with the notion of church or religious group of the American model of pluralism. Since the Hindu traditions are not united around a core set of beliefs accepted by all followers, there is no one individual or body who can speak for all others. The question of religious authority is irrelevant here. Naturally, there are individuals who are highly respected because of their proficiency in a particular tradition or because of the distance they have covered on the route to happiness. These persons might speak for some tradition, but this is more like the way an excellent researcher speaks for a scientific domain than like the cleric representing his church. That is, the authority of the teacher of a tradition depends on several aspects: the extent to which his or her instructions help other people to progress on the route to happiness; the quality of his or her thought, speech, art, ritual performance; the level at which it resonates with others; etc. The authority of these individuals to represent a tradition can be challenged at any time, because it is not embedded in a shared set of doctrines or a fixed religious authority. Given the nature of these traditions, the norm that churches or religious groups should be voluntary associations has no significance. They cannot but be voluntary. An individual joins a tradition and remains a follower only to the extent this tradition and its teachers are able to help him or her and satisfy adhyatmic and other dimensions. At all times, individuals can leave a tradition and look for other teachers and instructions that appeal more to them. From this perspective, insisting that a religious association ought to be voluntary generates only puzzlement or amusement.\nGenerally, the normative principles of American pluralism fail to make sense to these pagan traditions. The principle of toleration is comical at best. Try telling a Hindu that she ought to tolerate the fact that her neighbor does puja to another deva, that he has another ishta devata, or that he belongs to a different adhyatmic tradition. Since the Hindu traditions do not embody doctrines that can be either true or false, there is nothing to be tolerated. Different kinds of people have different ishta devatas, belong to different traditions and participate in different practices. That is how it has always been. Difference is not problematic here. Therefore, there is no question of toleration. The neutrality of the state and the issue of separating politics and religion are more complex. The Hindu traditions revolve around the goal shared by all human beings: to become happy. They offer different roads and routes that appeal to different kinds of human beings. From their perspective, the only aim of politics is to create the conditions in which people can strive for and attain the goal of happiness. Therefore, the principle of state neutrality is as insignificant and unintelligible as that of toleration: it would be ridiculous for the state to impose one particular tradition on all its subjects, since the variety of inclinations and capacities among human beings necessitates a diversity of routes to look for and attain happiness. Such traditions do not claim truth for their routes, but let the validity of a route depend on the extent to which it works for an individual. Therefore, imposing one tradition is not a reasonable option.\nIt must be obvious by now that the principle of religious liberty becomes absurd in this context. In the absence of competing truth claims, what sense does it make to preach that all individuals ought to be left free to practice their own traditions? How would Hindus react if one tells them that they should not prevent their neighbor from doing puja to Ganesha instead of Krishna or from praying to Shirdi Sai Baba instead of Jesus Christ? The same sense of puzzlement and disbelief would return. It is true though that the rise of Hindutva in India has given a new significance to this issue. Should Muslims and Christians be free to propagate their religions as the only true ones and that all human beings ought to convert to Islam or Christianity? This question is important, but irrelevant to the problems of American pluralism. Therefore, it will not be discussed here.\nThe tenet that all religious groups should be treated as equals by the state and its educational system is perhaps the most relevant from the perspective of the Hindu traditions. These traditions have been depicted negatively in American textbooks and in higher education. The reasons are simple: Americans have viewed the Hindu traditions through the only perspective they have on religion and tradition, viz.,that of the biblical framework. Therefore, these traditions cannot but be represented as pale and erring variants of biblical religion. In the explicitly theological view, they are false religions, idolatry or worship of the devil; in the eyes of its secularized alternative, they are \u0026lsquo;polytheism\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo;. The result is the same: the pagan traditions of India are transformed into inferior variants of Christianity.\nThe trouble is that the only way in which the American model of pluralism allows the Hindus to challenge this depiction presupposes the same theological framework. That is, the notions of religion and church of American pluralism compel the Hindu traditions to represent themselves as variants of biblical religion. They have to appoint individuals or bodies that represent all other members; they have to inform the American educational system about the true teachings of Hinduism; they need to make their traditions respectable in the eyes of American Protestants and their secularized brethren. The consequence is that the NRI community is compelled to cooperate in the transformation of its traditions into inferior variants of the religions of the book. But this takes us to the next question: what challenge confronts American pluralism and the NRI community?\nThe Challenge of the NRI Community\nThe structure of American pluralism and the nature of the Hindu traditions give rise to two options. These options present themselves as routes that can be traveled by the NRI community in the coming years. On the one hand, the pagan traditions of India could renounce their true nature and transform themselves into variants of biblical religion. Then they will soon fit in as well in the American model of pluralism as the Jews and Muslims. On the other hand, these pagan traditions can remain true to their nature and explicitly represent themselves as completely different from the religions of the book. Then they will turn into a major challenge to American pluralism: the very structure of this model will require rethinking in order to accommodate the Hindu traditions.\nCurrently, the NRI community is succumbing to the first option. It has accepted the American model of pluralism as the structure to which it should adapt itself. This could be seen very clearly in the California textbook controversy. A limited number of foundations have been appointed (or have appointed themselves) as the representatives of the Hindu traditions in the U.S.: the Hindu American Foundation and the Vedic Foundation are most prominent. These foundations play according to the rules of the notions of church and religion that are intrinsic to American pluralism. They challenge the unfair portrayal of the Hindu traditions in the American educational system. But they do so in a manner which advances the transformation of these traditions into inferior variants of Christianity. They intend to present the true doctrines of Hinduism and do so by making it look respectable to American Protestants. That is, the many devatas are transformed into different ways of worshiping the one true God. Hinduism becomes a proper monotheistic faith. A variety of pagan Indian traditions are excluded because they are embarrassing to the sanitized biblical model of American pluralism. These Hindu foundations have become the representatives of the \u0026lsquo;Hindu church\u0026rsquo; in America: they will decide the true nature of the Hindu traditions for the American public. The way they are going, however, they will end up with a secularized variant of the old biblical understanding of the Hindu traditions as false religion.\nWe have to be fair to these foundations: they confront an extremely difficult task. During the last four centuries, the dominant way of describing the pagan traditions of India has conformed to the Christian framework of the West. The missionaries and travelers transmitted the \u0026lsquo;facts\u0026rsquo; about these pagan traditions to the European common sense. But these facts were already framed within Christian theology: there had to be religion in India; these religions would worship many (false) gods rather than the one true God; these religions would be founded in a set of beliefs about these gods and their relation to humanity; the practices of worship would embody these doctrines; etc. The scholars and human sciences of Europe took these Christian theological descriptions as the basic material of their theorizing. Later, Americans reproduced the same assumptions and images. The result is \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo;, the religion of the Hindus. Tragically, colonialism had the Indian pagans adopt this description of their own traditions. Today their intellectuals and educated layers also believe this \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; exists. Consequently, the NRI community understands the predicament it confronts in a particular way: how should this religion of Hinduism be represented fairly and accurately in the American public sphere and educational system?\nIf the American NRI community desires to remain true to the nature of its cultural traditions and travel the second route, the first thing it will have to realize is that this is a flagrant misunderstanding of its predicament. Its real quandary is this: how to break out of the straitjacket in which American pluralism and its theological structure have imprisoned the pagan traditions of India?\nThis straitjacket has a long history. It is the framework through which the western culture has always looked at other cultures. It is the paradigm that still sustains the dominant human sciences of today and their understanding of non-western cultures. It effectively transforms the Hindu traditions into pallid variants of biblical religion. In case the NRI community decides to opt for the second route, it will require an alternative framework to approach its own cultural traditions. Such an alternative framework will study the pagan traditions of India in a different way. Some of the properties of these traditions have been reviewed in the previous section: they are instructions for action rather than doctrines; they offer a variety of routes to the human aim of happiness; the diversity of stories, practices, traditions, teachers and deities is intrinsic to their nature; etc. If the NRI community wants to avoid transforming its traditions into variants of biblical religion, it needs to promote and support such alternative approaches to the study of its cultural traditions.\nNow is the time for the NRI community to choose its leadership carefully. It needs people who are aware of the depth of the problems. Otherwise, it will succumb to the demands of American pluralism. It will waste its energy on irrelevant concerns borrowed from Christianity: \u0026lsquo;Who speaks for Hinduism?\u0026rsquo;; \u0026lsquo;Who has the authority to represent our religion?\u0026rsquo;; \u0026lsquo;Should only insiders be allowed to do so?\u0026rsquo;; \u0026lsquo;What are the true teachings of Hinduism?\u0026rsquo; Events like the California textbook controversy indicate that the NRI community is at a crucial juncture: either it will become a driving force behind the rejuvenation of the Indian culture and her traditions; or it will repeat the mistakes of three-hundred years of colonialism. In the last century, we have seen the endpoints of the latter route: a growing fanaticism in Indian society; intellectually superficial movements; the threat of bankruptcy of an entire culture. The other route promises to allow the NRI community to play its role: become a rich and vibrant challenge to American pluralism. Not so that pluralism and tolerance might disappear from the American society but so that a pluralism, worthy of its name and liberated from the biblical straitjacket, might come into existence. Perhaps it is time we explore this route!\nComments Vivek Shah — 2015-06-28 11:57:45\nI have been reading this series of articles, and I was hoping to get to the end before commenting. However, I think that this is an important to stop and describe my reaction reading thus far.\nFirstly, I commend your sensitivity at both comprehending and presenting the situation in previous articles. Yes, Indians have experienced two colonial periods in direct succession, the former which disrupted the transmission of tradition and the latter which totally altered the traditions themselves so as to render them unrecognizable to the recipients of that tradition. Industrialism, Enlightenment values, and modernity have also taken their toll on the transmission of these traditions, as many of these practices were meant for pre-industrial societies. So, \u0026ldquo;Hindus\u0026rdquo; of the current modern age (or rather post-modern age) face the double-challenge of 1) reaquiring the traditions which have been lost as a result of colonial violence and industrial displacement, and 2) translate these traditions in a way that can be recognizable to the 21st century. Particularly, Hindus living in the United States face the challenge of transmitting their traditions to their children coherently, and the particular means of action they adopt may serve as a model to the rest of the world.\nYou are also correct in your assessment of religion in America. Many different ethnic groups with differing religious constitutions have migrated to America, and all such groups have been more or less accommodated in the structure of American civil religion. The commonalities of Biblical origin is an obvious reasons, as well as the commonalities in praxis. However, Indians face a challenge in that their traditions do not trace themselves back to the Bible, and that difference does at times create complications. That much is true.\nHowever, where I depart with the description of Indian traditions above is the conception of Indian religion and doctrine. Yes, it is true that Indians did not traditionally use words like \u0026ldquo;religion\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;doctrine,\u0026rdquo; which have Latin roots. Yes, it is true that the Indians did not use words like \u0026ldquo;God,\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;church,\u0026rdquo; which have German roots. However, it is not the case that Indians are so different and so entirely \u0026ldquo;other\u0026rdquo; that they are absolutely unable to recognize commonalities of Abrahamic traditions within their own traditions.\nAfter all, there is the concept of a sampradaya, which is a well understood and utilized means of transmitting traditions in India. Often times, such as in the case of Vaishnava sampradayas, there is a very specific siddhanta or philosophical conclusion espoused and ascribed to each school. These sampradayas make their own truth claims based on scriptural interpretations, they congregate and pray in places of worship specific to their sampradaya, and they have rituals and marks specific to each sampradaya.\nSpeaking of Vaishnava sampradayas in particular, I am shocked at the portrayal of Hindu conceptions of the Sacred. Yes, it is true that some sampradayas hold the Advaitic concept of impersonal Brahman to be true and sacred, but there are several sampradayas which do assert the existence of an eternal personal being responsible for the creation, sustanence, and destruction of the world, the concept of Paramatman, Parabrahman, Purushottama, Ishvara, and Bhagavan. I should also point out that this conception of a personal deity predated the arrival of Muslims and Europeans into India. Furthermore, the continuity of discourse between Vedantins who posited impersonal Brahman and personal Ishvara were not with other religions like the Muslims - the discourse occurred amongst themselves. There are even sampradayas besides the Vedantins who had the components of personal deity, doctrine, and religious community. Examples include Kashmiri Saivism and Saiva Siddhanta.\nAre there forms of religiosity in India beyond the bhakti-traditions? Certainly. While it is true that the Vedic tradition does not possess a definite deity or doctrine, the very fact that the transmission of Vedic tradition has been facilitated through different shakhas is evidence enough of religious communities with slightly different opinions of ritual procedure. Furthermore, all Vedic shakhas claim to be descended from the Brahma Sampradaya, as Brahma is believed to have been first in their lineage, save for the Shukla Yajurvedins, who descend from the Surya Sampradaya.\nPerhaps the hard work of reaquiring the Indian traditions is itself the first option you outlined. Islamic and European colonial violence has displaced Indians from their traditions, and the traditional means of acquiring these traditions - the sampradayic lineages. Perhaps the job is, rather than continue performing pujas to a wide variety of devis and devatas without any particular doctrinal concerns, to realign themselves with their traditional sampradayas, which is how these traditions have been transmitted historically in the first place.\n","tags":[],"title":"Facing the challenge of American Pluralism on the future of NRI community","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/facing-the-challenge-of-american-pluralism-on-the-future-of-nri-community/"},{"categories":["india-forum","Jakob"],"content":"What is at stake in the California textbook controversy? Few would agree that it concerns only the image of Hinduism as offered to the pupils of the California state schools. The controversy involves much more than that alone. It is the next phase in the NRI community\u0026rsquo;s struggle for a less biased and more benign portrayal of Hinduism in the educational system and in American society in general. In the last three years many similar incidents have occurred: the acrimonious debate about \u0026lsquo;Wendy\u0026rsquo;s Child Syndrome\u0026rsquo;; the Kripal and Courtright controversies; the indignation about the depiction of Hindu deities on bikini\u0026rsquo;s, slippers and toilet seats; etc. These transient outbursts express a solid and growing concern about the derogatory conceptions of the Hindu traditions, which still dominate the western societies and academia. In very general terms, the aim of this struggle could be put as follows: to make the world aware of the positive contributions the Indian culture and its traditions have made and can make to humanity. Since this is an aim I share, I would like to assess the NRI community\u0026rsquo;s progress towards its realization. This evaluation will take the California textbook controversy as a reference point, while addressing some of the broader issues involved.\nI\nThe American Hindus often state their desire for a more positive portrayal of Hinduism. Hence, they point out, this religion should be represented by \u0026lsquo;insiders\u0026rsquo; and by those who are sympathetic towards it. Either Hindus should speak for Hinduism or those \u0026lsquo;outsiders\u0026rsquo; who hold a benign view of its teachings. In the California textbook controversy, we encounter an excellent illustration of the results of this approach.\nFirst, there are the recommendations of the Hindu Education Foundation (HEF). These seem very reasonable. The Aryan invasion should be presented as hypothesis rather than fact. When one intends to depict a Brahmin, one would better not use a picture of a Muslim praying to Allah. When one portrays Chandragupta, it is indeed preferable not to use a drawing of a Chinese nobleman or warrior. Obvious mistakes and damaging remarks are removed. So far so good. The problem is these corrections do not constitute much of an alternate portrayal of the Hindu traditions. They merely correct some of the details. These corrections will be acceptable to many Indologists, since the main understanding of Indian culture does not change in any way.\nWhen we turn to the proposals of the Vedic Foundation, however, dramatic changes do occur. Wherever the textbooks say Hindu \u0026lsquo;stories\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;writings\u0026rsquo;, it wants Hindu \u0026lsquo;scriptures\u0026rsquo;. Innocent this may seem. However, this move transforms the Hindu traditions with their vast array of rich and complex stories, told and retold in many different ways, into a rigid body of canonical scriptures\u0026ndash;much like Christianity or Islam. Consequently, these \u0026lsquo;scriptures\u0026rsquo; require protection, because they are no longer stories, but sacred doctrines.\nWhere the textbooks discuss \u0026rsquo;enlightenment\u0026rsquo; and the \u0026rsquo;enlightened\u0026rsquo; in the Hindu traditions, the Foundation writes \u0026lsquo;God realization\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;God realized\u0026rsquo;. \u0026lsquo;Brahman\u0026rsquo; is systematically replaced by \u0026lsquo;God\u0026rsquo;. Again, the implications go beyond mere words. Hindu tradition and its notions of Brahman and enlightenment are not in any way related to anything like the \u0026lsquo;God\u0026rsquo; of Christianity\u0026ndash;who is believed to be a person without a body who created and governs the universe, but exists outside it. It gets even worse when this Foundation denies that the Hindu traditions revolve around \u0026lsquo;multiple gods\u0026rsquo; and reverence towards these various gods. No, they claim, these many deities are in fact one \u0026lsquo;God\u0026rsquo; or at most various forms of \u0026lsquo;God\u0026rsquo;. Ancient Hindus did not go to temples to \u0026lsquo;connect with their gods\u0026rsquo;, but to \u0026lsquo;worship God\u0026rsquo;. Once again, when American children and adults read \u0026lsquo;God\u0026rsquo; in the textbooks, they will obviously understand the Christian God and not something like the \u0026lsquo;Brahman\u0026rsquo; of the Hindu traditions. In fact, when one uses \u0026lsquo;God\u0026rsquo; in English, the one possible referent is the Judeo-Christian God\u0026ndash;the creator and sovereign of the universe who demands from humanity perfect obedience to his will and exclusive worship of himself. In effect, the proposal of the Vedic Foundation makes this Christian \u0026lsquo;God\u0026rsquo; into the main focus of Hinduism.\nII\nDoes this transformation of the Hindu traditions constitute a positive portrayal? One would think not. Still, some might point out that sixth-graders will not be confused by theological intricacies. However, the point is not so much what American children will or will not grasp, but rather the fact that these Hindus think they are improving upon the dominant image of Hinduism. Here, one might add that the corrections of the Vedic Foundation were subject to the restrictions imposed by the California education department and that they are certainly less harmful than the concerned sections of the textbooks originally were. But are they really?\nWhen the textbooks talk about Hindus worshipping many gods, they inevitably presuppose the Christian image of idolatry or false religion. The very notion of polytheism makes sense only against this background. In English, \u0026lsquo;god\u0026rsquo; or \u0026rsquo;theism\u0026rsquo; refers to a being like the Judeo-Christian God. Now, of course, there can be only one such Being, since He is supposed to be the Creator and Sovereign of the universe. The universe cannot be governed by many gods. This would result in chaos, instead of the order supposedly created by the Judeo-Christian God\u0026rsquo;s Will. Consequently, if one says Hindus worship many \u0026lsquo;gods\u0026rsquo; or engage in \u0026lsquo;poly-theism\u0026rsquo;, the logical consequence is these can only be false gods (as opposed to the true God), since they are more than one. This reproduces the Christian theological claim that Hinduism is false religion.\nNow take the Vedic Foundation\u0026rsquo;s suggestion that the many \u0026lsquo;gods\u0026rsquo; should be replaced by \u0026lsquo;God\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;many forms of God\u0026rsquo; or that \u0026lsquo;Brahman\u0026rsquo; should be rendered as \u0026lsquo;God\u0026rsquo;. As said, \u0026lsquo;God\u0026rsquo; in western languages refers to the Creator and Sovereign\u0026ndash;a person whose Will governs the universe (everything that ever has been, is and will be). There is no such conception of God to be found in the Hindu traditions. Still, the implication of the Foundation\u0026rsquo;s corrections is that Hindus do not worship their many gods, but actually worship the one true God without being aware of it. This is a slightly modified version of what Christianity has always said about idolaters or devil-worshippers. They desire to worship the one true God. They thirst for Him, because He has ingrained a sense of divinity in their souls. But the devil seduces them into mistaking himself for the true God and therefore they begin to worship many false gods. Unwittingly, the Vedic Foundation is reproducing the same theological story: Hindus mistakenly believe they worship many gods, but they should become aware that they actually worship the one true God through different forms.\nTaking the issue to a level more general than this particular controversy, we can similarly assess another typical dispute. Hinduism has often been described as an inconsistent and incoherent \u0026lsquo;jungle\u0026rsquo; of beliefs and practices by the Indologists. A diversity of traditions co-exists within the Hindu fold. One can be a Hindu without accepting any one doctrine as true. Such facts have been taken as expressions of the inchoate nature of this religion. So has the fact that Hindu traditions have experienced relatively few problems in living side by side with religions like Islam and Christianity. Again, this view reproduces the Christian view of pagan idolatry. In James Mill\u0026rsquo;s words: \u0026lsquo;Whenever indeed we seek to ascertain the definite and precise ideas of the Hindus in religion, the subject eludes our grasp. All is loose, vague, wavering, obscure, and inconsistent. Their expressions point at one time to one meaning, and another time to another meaning; and their wild fictions, to use the language of Mr. Hume, seem rather the playsome whimsies of monkeys in human shape than the serious asservations of a being who dignifies himself with the name of the rational.\u0026rsquo;\nBoth the Hindu foundations and western Indologists who are sympathetic towards the Hindu traditions have tried to make this into a benign property of Hinduism. The intrinsic tolerance of Hinduism, they say, stems from its pluralist conception of religious truth. The Hindus believe that all religions are true and therefore they are very tolerant. Prima facie, this may sound nice and comfy. But let us not be misled by first impressions and draw a few implications. If Hindus believe that all religions are true, this implies they must believe that both Islam and Christianity are true i.e. the doctrines of both these religions are true. Christian doctrine claims that God consists of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit and that Jesus Christ is the Son of God. Islamic doctrine, on the other hand, states that God is one and cannot be a trinity and that He could not have a son who is both divine and human. These two doctrines stand in clear contradiction: both cannot be true at the same time. But according to the current \u0026lsquo;positive\u0026rsquo; portrayal of Hinduism, Hindus are not able to see this, since they believe that all religions are true. Thus, this portrayal makes the Hindus into logical cretins, who lack the basic capacity of consistent reasoning.\nThe same kind of problem recurs in most of the \u0026lsquo;positive\u0026rsquo; corrections made by today\u0026rsquo;s Hindu organizations to the dominant image of Hinduism. Does the problem in the contemporary understanding of the Hindu traditions really revolve around a few derogatory remarks and an occasionally negative tone? Should one merely leave out the two or three sexually-oriented paragraphs in Courtright\u0026rsquo;s Ganesha book in order to correct the mistaken portrayal? Do we just have to ban Kripal\u0026rsquo;s silly book and Witzel\u0026rsquo;s obnoxious remarks to come to a better assessment of the contributions of the Indian culture to humanity? Should we make \u0026lsquo;God\u0026rsquo; into the focus of Hinduism in order to have American students appreciate the richness of the Hindu traditions? It seems not.\nThe negativity is ingrained in the very structure of the dominant image of the Indian culture and its traditions. The entire understanding of the Hindu traditions today is constituted by Christian theological schemes. Therefore, one has to reject the understanding at the root and replace it by a cognitively superior description of the Indian culture. Otherwise, one will simply add \u0026lsquo;positive-sounding\u0026rsquo; layers to the currently dominant conception. Instead of improving the understanding of the Hindu traditions, such corrections simply hide the problems we are facing today in the study of the Indian culture. They superficially cover up the negativity. While doing so, they conceal the main problems to be addressed in the development of an alternative understanding of the Hindu traditions.\nIII\nWhat, then, is going wrong in the struggle of the NRI community? After all, its general aim of acknowledging and demanding recognition of the positive contributions of the Indian culture is a noble and legitimate one. So is the attempt to resist the negative representation of Hinduism in the western academia and educational systems. Yet, the difficulties arise when an alternate conception of the Hindu traditions is asked for. At that point, it becomes clear that no positive alternative is available today among \u0026lsquo;insiders\u0026rsquo; and scholars sympathetic to Hinduism. That is, in spite of its benevolent tone, the understanding they offer makes all the mistakes of the dominant negative portrayal.\nThe same thing has happened in the past. In the nineteenth century, the Romantic Orientalists and Hindu reformers also contested the dismissive and offensive picture of India and her traditions. This picture had been created by missionaries and travelers, who were convinced they would find nothing but devil worship, false religion and evil practices in the society of the subcontinent. The Orientalists and Hindu reformers attacked the \u0026rsquo;evangelists\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;anglicists\u0026rsquo; with the same kind of vehemence that has returned today in the struggle against the dominant forms of Indology. But they failed miserably to give an alternative understanding of the Indian culture. In fact, they succumbed to an era of evangelical propaganda and colonial education. Eventually, the colonial inferiority complex of the nineteenth-century Hindu reformers inspired a massive attempt to transform the native traditions into a Hindu theism\u0026ndash;Protestant theology dressed up in Hindu garb.\nIn my analysis, what happens today is a replay of those events. Michael Witzel, Wendy Doniger and their allies have taken on the role of missionaries like Charles Grant; while the Vedic Foundation and people like Rajeev Malhotra have become the Rammohan Roy\u0026rsquo;s and Dayananda Saraswati\u0026rsquo;s of the twenty-first century. If the battle is fought at this level, the outcome is predictable. The Hindus will accept the terms of description as fixed by the western culture, just like the nineteenth-century Hindu reformers succumbed to the colonial image of the Indian culture. The entire struggle will take place within the intellectual constraints set by American society and its academia.\nIn the end, the American Hindus will truly complete the work of the missionaries: they will have converted themselves into Hindu Christians. This is what the Brahmo Samaj, the Arya Samaj and their progeny have done in India; this is what the Hindu foundations in America will do if they continue along the same lines. Like the nineteenth-century reform movements, the foundations of today are sanitizing the Hindu traditions into a proper religion according to Judeo-Christian standards. They are neither continuing the traditions as passed on by the Indian ancestors nor critically reflecting upon them. Instead, they transform Hindu tradition into a second-hand Christianity.\nIV\nHow could we explain this sidetracking of the struggle of the Hindu community in America? This group lives in the West and it legitimately challenges the West\u0026rsquo;s negative stereotypes of India. What we have to understand today, is how the dominant framework of western societies compels them to reshape their traditions into a Christian mould while they are doing so. American identity politics seems to force each minority community to assert itself as a separate \u0026lsquo;church\u0026rsquo; with its own distinct religious or ethnic identity. Only in this way do western societies allow the local Hindu communities to strive for recognition and protection.\nIf I didn\u0026rsquo;t know better, I would suspect that what is happening today is part of a planned strategy. The tremendous success of the NRI community in American society is threatening at several levels: (a) after the Chinese, it is the first time members of a \u0026lsquo;pagan\u0026rsquo; culture are this successful in Christian America; (b) this success has made the NRI community aware of the fact that its own culture and its Hindu traditions have something to offer to the world; (c) hence, they contest the negative portrayal of their culture in Christian America and (unlike the Chinese) they have stridently joined the debates in the media and academia; (d) to the WASP-majority, this is very different from what the Catholics, Jews and Muslims did earlier, since it concerns a \u0026lsquo;heathen religion\u0026rsquo;, which is as different from the dominant Protestant culture as anything could possibly be. How does one neutralize such a threat?\nThe answer is obvious: by shaping the energy, the vehemence and the intellectual acuity of the American Hindus in a particular way, which defuses the attack. You give them an easy target: the Indologists who speak and write derogatorily about India and Hinduism. You allow them to assert the value of their culture within certain limits: they merely become the next group to demand recognition of their own religious and ethnic identity (after the Catholics, the Jews, the Blacks, etc.). Thus, the NRI community becomes the next church-like ghetto-culture in a society that revolves around identity politics. They no longer pose any threat to the mainstream WASP-culture. They do not even offer an alternative way of being.\nNaturally, things do not happen in a planned way like this. There is no WASP conspiracy against the NRI-community and its self-assertion. The problem lies at the level of the very structure of American society. Its identity politics has defused any threatening cultural alternative in the past. To borrow one of Rajeev Malhotra\u0026rsquo;s ploys: at first, the Irish Catholics were not regarded as \u0026lsquo;whites\u0026rsquo; by the WASP-community. After a struggle in which the Irish were gradually forced to form a Protestant church with Catholic overtones, they were accepted as a proper white community. Next, the same thing happened to the Jews. Later other communities followed. Now, it is the turn of the Hindus. Their cultural identity will be accepted and recognized once it takes a recognizable, non-threatening form, once it ceases being a true alternative to the dominant WASP-culture. This is the task assigned to the Vedic foundations and the Rajeev Malhotra\u0026rsquo;s in today\u0026rsquo;s America. This explains why, for instance, they find support among the conservatives in the California board: these conservatives recognize and acknowledge the fact that the American Hindus are the next community to aspire the proper \u0026rsquo;ethnic community\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;religious identity\u0026rsquo; status in American society.\nV\nTo conclude, the NRI-community stands at historical crossroads today: (a) It can become \u0026lsquo;white\u0026rsquo; like the Irish, the Jews and other communities have before. This implies it will make its own culture into the next ghetto within the western culture. It will then transform the Hindu traditions into a Hindu-Protestant church with its own sacrosanct teachings and inviolable sensitivities. The tragic consequence is that the NRI foundations become more harmful to the Hindu traditions than the Witzels, the Donigers and the Southern Baptist missionaries of this world. (b) Or it can reflect upon the nature of Indian culture and its traditions and the capacity these have to offer fruitful alternatives to the western culture and its ways of being. Then, it cannot but look for a new way of understanding the Hindu traditions, which goes far beyond the second-hand Christianity of the nineteenth-century Hindu reformers.\nIn case the NRI community takes the second road, it will find strong intellectual support in the research program developed by S.N. Balagangadhara. During the last ten years, he has built a new way of understanding the Indian culture and its traditions. Very recently, one of his ground-breaking proposals has taken shape in an article in the Journal of the American Academy of Religion (December 2005, Vol. 73, no. 4, 987-1013). As he argues there, the agenda for the future does not hinge upon the question \u0026lsquo;who speaks for Hinduism?\u0026rsquo; Rather, it revolves around the question of how to speak for the Indian traditions. How can we make the insights of these traditions available to the twenty-first century? How could we demonstrate that the Indian culture and its Hindu traditions have contributed a vast storehouse of knowledge to humanity, rather than shout that it is so? What Balagangadhara makes clear is that this is not a task for \u0026lsquo;insiders\u0026rsquo; alone. The knowledge of the Hindu traditions belongs to humanity. In the same way, all human beings who are willing to make the effort, regardless of skin color, religious identity, ethnic background can contribute to the restoration of these traditions to their rightful position.\n","tags":[],"title":"Towards a positive portrayal of Hindu traditions?","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/towards-a-positive-portrayal-of-hindu-traditions/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","caste","india-forum","psychology","tradition","translation"],"content":"In one sense, the title of the piece captures the nature of the tasks facing the contemporary generation, whether in India or in the Diaspora. This generation, unlike many from mine, is confident and self-assured; perhaps, it is proud too about the strength of its culture and traditions. Rightly so. However, personal convictions about the value of our traditions and culture do not automatically guarantee the truth of such convictions. Not only that. It is also the case that the history of India, and that of the entire humankind, requires of us that we are able to say and show what is valuable and what is not in our traditions. This history is the history of colonialism, subservience, and is further weighed down by the scientific, technological, economic and the military weight of the western culture. Today, we need more than a mere practice and a further continuation of our traditions; we need also to examine them honestly and critically in order that we may transmit what we found valuable in them.\nIn the past, the Indians chose multiple ways of undertaking such a task: from the one extreme of a wholesale rejection of everything Indian to the other extreme of a total endorsement of everything Indian. There were reasons both for the extremes and for the varieties that lay in-between. Though understandable, none of these attempts brought us much by way of understanding the Indian traditions. For all their answers, we remain where they were too: trapped in the framework that refuses to budge or go away. What is the nature of this framework? Why does it entrap? How to get out of it? Where should we be going when we get out of the framework? In a series of articles, I would like to reflect on these questions.\nWith respect to us Indians, there is one thing we need to constantly keep in mind. We are the products of two colonialisms: the Islamic and the British. True, we were overrun by many other conquerors, but they did not colonize us. Colonialism is not merely about conquering territories, ruling over people and extracting revenues. It is a far more inhuman process, involving violence of all sorts: from the purely physical to the purely psychic. Colonialism alters the way we look at the world and it displaces native ways of experiencing the world through sheer violence. To the colonized, there is no simple or naive return to the lost world possible. Colonization forever changes the world of the colonized. Though tragic and reprehensible, this is what colonialism does and we need to understand this truth about ourselves in the first place.\nIf Islamic colonialism damaged the transmission of our culture, British colonialism, building further on this result, introduced a new framework for experiencing the world. More than that, it also introduced a new way of talking about our experience of the world. This framework told us many new things about ourselves: we were backward and primitive, steeped in superstition, and dominated by antiquated structures. The British taught us too what these structures were: the caste system was the Indian social structure and \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;Buddhism\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;Jainism\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;Sikhism\u0026rsquo; etc. were our religious structures. For reasons I cannot go into here, Indians took to this way of talking about themselves the way ducks take to water. In the colonized field that the Indian mind had become, many Indians set up tents to sell their merchandise: an attack on the Indian caste system; an instant mixture of reform that could cure the ills of the Indian \u0026lsquo;religions\u0026rsquo;; tracts and books that told tales of the tyranny of the Brahmin \u0026lsquo;priests\u0026rsquo;; and, of course, the sale of the seductive siren songs of modernization and progress. On the other side of the Ganges, so to speak, rival merchants set up their tents as well: to sell the waters of the Ganges in cheap plastic bottles so that the Indians could wash away all their \u0026lsquo;sins\u0026rsquo;. Is it not amazing that this picture (which crystallized around the middle of the eighteenth century) remains true and accurate today, more than sixty years after our independence from the colonial rule? In the bustle of the market place and the excitement of selling exotic goods, Indians \u0026lsquo;forgot\u0026rsquo; to ask that one question which they should have: did the tales of the British describe the Indian culture and her traditions or do they indicate how the British experienced India?\nYou see, there lies the rub. The British descriptions had more to do with their experiences of an alien culture than with the truth about India and her people. Yet, they spoke as though their experience of India were synonymous with the facts about India. When we took over the reins of our country from them, we did not just inherit colonial buildings and the colonial bureaucracy. We also actively took over their descriptions as though the experiences of the British are also uncontestable facts about India. So convinced are we about these \u0026lsquo;facts\u0026rsquo; that challenging their status today provokes the ire of most well-intentioned and educated Indians. Yet, perhaps, the strangest of all is this: those who defend the factual status of British descriptions hardly know or understand what they are defending. Let me mention just two of these. One: the caste system dominates the Indian society and that it must be abolished; two: \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;Buddhism\u0026rsquo; etc. are the religions of India.\nLet me begin with the caste system. The British did not just say that there were Jatis in India. No Indian would ever deny this. They and all the subsequent social sciences say something far more than this: the claim is that all the different Jatis in India constitute a coherent totality, such a totality forms the social structure of the Indian society, and that some of the Indian religions (sometimes, it is exclusively \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo;) and some of the Jatis (often, it is mostly the Brahmins) provide the ideology supporting such a social structure. This is what it means to say that \u0026rsquo;there is caste system in the Indian society\u0026rsquo;. That is, both the British and the current social sciences are not making an empirical claim about the presence of Jatis in India; they are putting across theoretical meta-claims about the Jatis.\nIf we want to assess the truth of these theoretical claims (make no mistake about this; they are through and through theoretical in nature), then the evidence cannot be what we routinely come up with: the horror stories of \u0026lsquo;caste discrimination\u0026rsquo;, the alleged humiliation of the so-called \u0026lsquo;Dalits\u0026rsquo;, the phenomenon of \u0026lsquo;untouchability\u0026rsquo;, the presence of poverty, and such like. None of these can serve as evidence for the claim that the nature of the Indian social structure is identical to \u0026rsquo;the caste system\u0026rsquo;. Why not?\nThe phenomenon of discrimination (whether individual or social) knows of many forms: from sexism through racism. They exist in different ways in different parts of the world. If their presence is evidence for the existence of \u0026rsquo;the caste system\u0026rsquo;, then it is present everywhere in the world. The same applies to poverty and humiliation. Such phenomena do not indicate that a specific social structure is present: they were there in slavery, in feudal societies in Europe, in the capitalist societies of today, and so on. In other words, these phenomena are compatible with multiple social structures: they do not indicate that one kind of a social structure is present in some society or another.\nSo, we cannot say that these phenomena are evidences for \u0026rsquo;the caste system\u0026rsquo;. We need some facts to be uniquely present in India, absent elsewhere, and these facts must tell us about the fundamental divisions in society. That is to say, if \u0026rsquo;the caste system\u0026rsquo; in India were to be its social structure, then the only significant social groups are the \u0026lsquo;castes\u0026rsquo;. Are we then to suppose that there are no workers, no middle class, no industrialists, etc. (which are the social groups in our society too) present in India\u0026rsquo; If we suggest that \u0026rsquo;the caste system\u0026rsquo; is the Indian social structure, then that is exactly what we would be suggesting. This, of course, is sheer nonsense.\nOne could say that India is a mish-mash of caste, class, social and power groups and so on (or any such combination). In that case, we are not saying interesting or profound except to notice that jatis exist in India. Who has ever denied this trivial fact?\nIf there is a problem about specification of the social division along the lines of caste, it gets compounded by a further theoretical claim: that \u0026rsquo;the caste system\u0026rsquo; is a coherent whole. This is merely an assumption. No one in the world has so far shown how and in what fashion \u0026rsquo;the caste system\u0026rsquo; is a coherent system. The British could not even classify the caste divisions let alone demonstrate their coherence. They gave up the attempt after trying for nearly thirty years and introducing all kinds of weird categories (like sub-castes, and sub-sub-castes).\nIf no one (a) has shown that the caste system is a social structure in India; (b) has shown that it is a coherent whole, then (c) what about the claim that it has a specific ideology? Here sensationalism rules the day: some lines from Manu, some personal anecdotes of the powerful and rich \u0026lsquo;Dalits\u0026rsquo;, who are courted by the US academia and the NRI populace in the US when such \u0026lsquo;Dalits\u0026rsquo; undertake a tour of the United States of America to sell their \u0026lsquo;autobiographies\u0026rsquo;, is the only evidence. Not one person has laid this alleged ideology bare; not one person knows what the components of this ideology are. How do we even know there is a single ideology? How do we know that there are not exactly 2371 and a half ideologies present? Again, your guess is as good as anybody else\u0026rsquo;s. Come to think of it, do we even know what an ideology looks like? Is Hitler\u0026rsquo;s Mein Kampf an example of an ideology?Is Marx\u0026rsquo;s Das Kapital an example of an ideology? Is Yajur veda or the Kama Sutra an example of an ideology? Is Amartya Sen\u0026rsquo;s The Argumentative Indian an example of an ideology? Or, is ideology something that people never put down in writing? Coffee-shop talk is no substitute for scientific research; it has never been. Many Indians and most NRI\u0026rsquo;s indignantly come up with precisely such coffee-shop talk when talking about \u0026rsquo;the caste system\u0026rsquo;. They are all instant experts on the issue without ever having studied about it.\nThis expertise stretches itself to grotesque proportions when one talks about \u0026lsquo;religions\u0026rsquo;. Everybody knows what \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo; is and knows too that \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; is an ancient religion. It stands to reason: which \u0026lsquo;Hindu\u0026rsquo; does not know about \u0026lsquo;Atman\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;Brahman\u0026rsquo;? After all, some carry both in their back pockets every day. Of course, such a possession is not the prerogative of the everyday \u0026lsquo;Hindus\u0026rsquo;: it is the special privilege of the illiterate NRI students of religious studies in the American universities. Instead of thoughtfully studying the framework of religious studies, which happens to be Christian theological in nature; instead of trying to understand the theory, practice and the history of Christianity, which requires considerable intellectual labor; instead, that is, of trying to understand how and why \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; is portrayed the way it is in the western culture (and not merely in the American universities), such people are beginning to tell the rest of us what \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; is. And what they tell us does not go beyond what the 18th century Jesuits told about our \u0026lsquo;religions\u0026rsquo; in terms of its content. The only difference between such people and the Christian missionaries is the valuation: these religious studies people speak \u0026lsquo;positively\u0026rsquo; of Hinduism and the missionaries spoke \u0026rsquo;negatively\u0026rsquo; of Hinduism.\nThere is a very deep reason why these people are such experts on \u0026rsquo;the caste system\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; as a religion. That is because they have simply taken over the European descriptions of their experience of India as though they are facts about India and her traditions. They do not know this fact, which is excusable. What is unforgivable is that they do not want to know it. I call this combination \u0026rsquo;the colonial consciousness\u0026rsquo;.\nPlease do not mistake me. I do believe that we need people realizing how the West has been describing us for the last four hundred years or so. We do need organizations like the HAF (the Hindu-American Foundation), which want to do something about this state of affairs in the United States. But my problem is about how they are going about doing it: they are trying to gain recognition and credibility to our traditions and customs by transforming \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; into a pale variant of Christianity, Judaism and Islam. These three religions do not understand either India or her traditions. Looking through their theological prisms, these religions transform us into false religions. Organizations like the HAF and many \u0026lsquo;Hindu\u0026rsquo; NRIs I know, paradoxically enough, accept this judgment. Having accepted this, they want to make us \u0026lsquo;respectable\u0026rsquo;. How? Our \u0026lsquo;Brahman\u0026rsquo; begins take the shape of the Biblical God, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. The Semitic religions ridicule and heap scorn on our traditions because our \u0026lsquo;gods\u0026rsquo; are not like the Biblical God: some NRIs and some NRI organizations bow down to this stance and fight for credibility by transforming our \u0026lsquo;gods\u0026rsquo; into \u0026lsquo;manifestations\u0026rsquo; of the \u0026lsquo;Brahman\u0026rsquo;, who looks like the Biblical God. I would like to recount an anecdote that should tell you how deep this attitude has sunk into the minds of our Indian intellectuals.\nA few years ago, in an international conference in India, we met in plenary sessions in a room. In the corner of the room, two reasonably big statues were present: one of the dancing Durga and the other of a dancing Ganesha. In one of the plenary meetings, the last session if I remember correctly, one of the foreign delegates asked what these statues were and what they were doing. The organizer of the conference, an Indian woman, said they were statues of Durga and Ganesha. \u0026lsquo;What were they doing?\u0026rsquo; After some uncomfortable shuffling of feet, this woman (who studied and got her Ph.D. in the US, at the UCB) said that they were \u0026lsquo;aesthetic objects\u0026rsquo;. Needless to say, I got annoyed and stood up and explained to the other delegates that these statues were no \u0026lsquo;art objects\u0026rsquo; of any kind. I told them they were the representations of our devatas and asked the organizer the following question: Since when do the Indians find an elephant headed, fat-bellied clumsy dancer with multiple arms beautiful? Which Indian woman would marry a groom who looked like Ganesha and consider him \u0026lsquo;beautiful\u0026rsquo;? Since when is a naked dancing woman with eight arms which hold different objects including a human looking head dripping with blood, with a tongue that is at least two feet long, an epitome of female beauty in India?\nBecause this woman and many like her are embarrassed by the questions which the foreigner asks, they transform us into aesthetic imbeciles who believe that monstrosities exhaust our notions of \u0026lsquo;beauty\u0026rsquo;. Instead of telling stories about Durga and Ganesha, this woman and others of her kind make us into cretins and morons who have no aesthetic sense at all. Or force us into a mold that resembles the Semitic religions. How far should we travel down this road before realizing that we are on the wrong route?\nToday, multiple tasks face us. We need to translate our traditions into the language of the twenty-first century. To do so, we need to shake off our sense of complacency in the first place. Secondly, we need to realize that we \u0026rsquo;talk the talk and walk the walk\u0026rsquo; of the colonizers. We need to break out of this. Thirdly, we should recognize that our traditions will not become ours just because we are brought up as Indians: we need to put in the hard intellectual labor of reacquiring these traditions. In the process, we need to take care that we do not make a travesty of our culture and traditions in our hurry to \u0026rsquo;translate\u0026rsquo; them.\nSo far, I have spoken about the first two of the tasks. Let me briefly turn my attention to the third: Why do we need hard labor to reacquire our own traditions? By way of an answer to the question, consider the frequently encountered answer of the NRI\u0026rsquo;s to the oft-posed problem, \u0026lsquo;what is Hinduism?\u0026rsquo;: \u0026lsquo;what our swamis tell us\u0026rsquo;.\nLet me begin reflecting on this answer by noticing something about this answer, which Jakob De Roover has gone deeper into: this answer transforms the Swami into a Catholic Priest. The Catholics believe in what the Roman Catholic Church tells them, and this Church is embodied in their priest. So, Catholicism, in this sense, is what the priest tells Christianity is. The Protestants rebelled against this: they said that Christianity is what the Scripture says. We also have our share of such people, who study our \u0026lsquo;scriptures\u0026rsquo; and come up with their own \u0026lsquo;interpretations\u0026rsquo;. So, if we give either of the two answers, we are doing and acting no different than a Christian. We are suggesting that we are also \u0026rsquo;like\u0026rsquo; Christianity: we too have our \u0026lsquo;scriptures\u0026rsquo;, our \u0026lsquo;priests\u0026rsquo; and home-grown Protestants in our midst.\nQuite apart from acting like Christians, let us notice what else we are doing. Consider the following question: \u0026lsquo;Why do we need the Swami\u0026rsquo;s to tell us what \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; is?\u0026rsquo; What qualifies them to do this? Is it because of their knowledge of Sanskrit or because they have been studying \u0026lsquo;scriptures\u0026rsquo; all their lives? In case you feel like giving a positive answer, reflect on this: is that not what all \u0026lsquo;pundits\u0026rsquo; do? Are we saying that there is no difference between a \u0026lsquo;pundit\u0026rsquo; and a \u0026lsquo;guru\u0026rsquo;? Furthermore, notice something else: if these are the reasons, then these swami\u0026rsquo;s are singularly unqualified for their task today. Our problem, let me repeat, is to \u0026rsquo;translate\u0026rsquo; our traditions into the language of the twenty-first century so that our own traditions make sense to us. These \u0026lsquo;swamis\u0026rsquo;, if this is all they know or can do, know nothing of the modern-day world, know nothing of the progress in natural or social sciences, know very little about modern-day thinking. How, then, can they help us and our children today? They simply cannot.\nIf we feel like saying that the teaching of \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; is so profound, eternal and timeless that modern knowledge is irrelevant to understanding its message, ask yourself the following question: in that case, why is it our children (and the younger generation) are so bored by these swami\u0026rsquo;s? Why is the younger generation so indifferent to these teachings? Why do these swami\u0026rsquo;s fail to fire the imagination of our children? And where some of these Swami\u0026rsquo;s try to become relevant to the modern-day world, there observe carefully what psychological \u0026rsquo;theories\u0026rsquo; they use in explaining the message of \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo;. You will be surprised by their naive endorsement of the third-rate \u0026lsquo;I am OK, you are OK\u0026rsquo; psychology, which no self-respecting psychologist would like to be caught dead with.\nAgain, please do not mistake me. I am neither attacking the swamis nor denigrating the role of Gurus in the Indian traditions. I just want you to start reflecting critically about your own answers and suggest that our problems do not know of easy solutions. We need hard labor today to even make sense of why we need Gurus or who can qualify for this. The Gurus of the twenty-first century world will not be mere \u0026lsquo;Sanyasins\u0026rsquo;, who know Sanskrit or have studied the Upanishads all their lives. We need a new breed that is at home in the modern world and has used the best scientific theories in the market place to make the Indian traditions their own. Such is the requirement for keeping our traditions alive and vibrant today.\nSo, if someone asks \u0026lsquo;what is Hinduism?\u0026rsquo; tell them that there is no such entity in the world outside the universities in the West. Tell them that when you call yourself a \u0026lsquo;Hindu\u0026rsquo; (for the sake of convenience) that is because you continue your ancestral traditions. Tell them that you \u0026lsquo;keep faith with your fathers, who kept faith with their forefathers, and were blessed in so doing\u0026rsquo;. Tell them too that you need no \u0026lsquo;reason\u0026rsquo; to keep your ancestral traditions alive and that the only reason to practice a tradition is the fact that what is practiced is a tradition, and that is what it means to be a \u0026lsquo;Hindu\u0026rsquo;. Is this answer also adequate?\nAs a beginning, yes. In the subsequent piece, which I will write soon, I will try and share with you some of my thoughts on this issue. We need to find new ways of answering questions about our identity and that of our traditions. My research is also focused upon questions like these. I would like to emphasize though that it is but one way of answering these and other questions. It is my hope that such a research will stimulate new and better research than I myself can undertake.\n","tags":[],"title":"Translations or Travesty of Traditions? –S.N.Balagangadhara","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/translations-or-travesty-of-traditions-s-n-balagangadhara/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","india-forum","Indian traditions","NRI","tradition","vibrancy"],"content":"While reading this contribution and all the others ([1], [3]) I hope to write, we need to keep the context in mind. The context is this: many intellectuals, both in India and among the NRIs elsewhere, appear bent on transforming our multiple traditions into a single \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo; called \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo;. The problem does not lie in the transformation of variety and diversity into a unity. Rather, it lies in trying to fit our traditions into the straightjacket of \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo;. While calling ourselves \u0026lsquo;Hindus\u0026rsquo; might be a convenient way of talking, the danger lies in going further and trying to develop \u0026lsquo;doctrines\u0026rsquo;, \u0026rsquo;theologies\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;catechisms\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;Ten Commandments\u0026rsquo; so that those around us in the West could recognize us as followers of a religion called \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo;. (These reflections are also applicable to \u0026lsquo;Buddhism\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;Jainism\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;Saivism\u0026rsquo; and all such entities.) In the course of my future contributions, I will look at some of the compulsions that force us to manufacture \u0026lsquo;Hinduism as a religion\u0026rsquo;. In this piece, I want to focus on the nature of traditions. What is a tradition? What differentiates religions from traditions? The second question will remain implicit until the end. By that time, we should have a better understanding of what it means to speak of a tradition.\nTowards the end of my previous piece, I formulated the following reflections:\nif someone asks \u0026lsquo;what is Hinduism?\u0026rsquo; tell them that there is no such entity in the world outside the universities in the West. Tell them that when you call yourself a \u0026lsquo;Hindu\u0026rsquo; (for the sake of convenience) that is because you continue your ancestral traditions. Tell them that you \u0026lsquo;keep faith with your fathers, who kept faith with their forefathers, and were blessed in so doing\u0026rsquo;. Tell them too that you need no \u0026lsquo;reason\u0026rsquo; to keep your ancestral traditions alive and that the only reason to practice a tradition is the fact that what is practiced is a tradition, and that is what it means to be a \u0026lsquo;Hindu\u0026rsquo;.\nI also asked the question whether such answers are adequate and suggested that they were, for the time being. In this contribution, I want to elaborate on some aspects of these answers. I can touch only on \u0026lsquo;some aspects\u0026rsquo; partly because my research into the question of the nature of our traditions is not yet complete and partly because of the nature of the question.\nIn order to understand what it means to \u0026lsquo;belong to a tradition\u0026rsquo; and what the notion of tradition itself means, let us begin by reflecting on how we were taught whatever we were taught. Here is how I grew up. Like most, I too learnt my tradition from my mother. She hardly went to middle school, never studied Sanskrit, but learnt stories, slokas and stotras from her parents. That is what she taught me, my brother and sisters. We went to the temples and subsidized the performance of ashtottaras and sahasranaamas whenever we had some extra money or because of some special occasion. Some purohit came and performed special ceremonies, whether they were the Shraaddhas of my grandparents or the Ganesha Chaturthi. My mother had perhaps never heard of \u0026lsquo;sarva darshana samgraha\u0026rsquo; and she definitely did not read Patanjali. She could only read those puranas (in Kannada translations) which I managed to find in Bangalore all those decades ago. In order to keep track of which puranas I borrowed from other people and elsewhere, I started reading them at an early stage. I read them for their stories and, at the behest of my mother, copied many stotras from these puranas and learnt quite a few of them \u0026lsquo;by heart\u0026rsquo;.\nBy the time I was into my twenties, I had \u0026lsquo;rejected\u0026rsquo; my upbringing. Having become a fire-breathing radical, I \u0026lsquo;discovered\u0026rsquo; that our culture and traditions were conservative and primitive. I came across young people of my age, who showed withering contempt for the Indian traditions (most of them were brought up as Christians, which partly explains their contempt but I did not realize it then). I took over their attitude, their language and their ways of deriding my tradition. Our traditions were puerile, the \u0026lsquo;Brahmins\u0026rsquo; were contemptible, and the caste system was a curse. It struck me only later that even though most of them were \u0026lsquo;atheists\u0026rsquo;, they never exhibited contempt for Christianity but demonstrated instead a healthy respect for the same. It had partly to do with the fact that their \u0026rsquo;teachers\u0026rsquo; (whom I vainly tried to make mine), mostly from the Christian Churches, were talking about something I hardly understood: \u0026rsquo;the theology of liberation\u0026rsquo;. However, it did not matter to me that these teachers were Christian believers; what mattered at that stage was that they stood behind us in our attempts to \u0026lsquo;alleviate poverty and suffering in India\u0026rsquo; and in our \u0026lsquo;resolute opposition to superstition and the caste system\u0026rsquo;.\nToday, more than 35 years later, my life has come full circle. I have gone through the Christian scriptures; I have learnt much from their theologies and from their history and practices. I have also gone through many, many writings by Indians about their multiple \u0026lsquo;religions\u0026rsquo;, read and studied many commentaries and Bhaasyas, and so on.\nToday, I realize that my family and I learnt more of Indian traditions from my mother than I have learnt from reading Pantanjali or Shankara. Reading the Bhaasyas allows me to discuss intellectually about them with my colleagues in Europe and America; no doubt too that I now know more about Atman, Koshas and such like than ever before. But my question is: where do I stand when compared to my mother\u0026rsquo; I would have liked to know that; but she is not here anymore. So, I will have to be satisfied with my own guess work: as a practitioner and transmitter of my traditions, I am certainly no better than my mother was. Where do I stand with respect to my brother and sisters, whose knowledge of Indian traditions is comparable to any other ordinary Indian\u0026rsquo; Not any better either, I firmly believe. If truth be told, I suspect I rank far behind them both.\nIn the first instance, this is what traditions are and this is how we learn them. They are simply sets of practices that our parents have passed on to us. The notion of \u0026lsquo;practices\u0026rsquo; is wide: from stories through the visits to temples to performing rituals. They include the swamis, the muths and the Gurus, if and where they exist, but can continue fine without these as well. In the simplest sense, traditions are inherited practices.\nHow are they transmitted? In a variety of ways: through language, through imitation, through instruction, through repeated performances, and so on. There is no one way to transmit a tradition anymore than there is a preferred manner of doing so. The variety of ways is necessary because \u0026rsquo;tradition\u0026rsquo; does not refer to any particular component but to a totality. In fact, some or another component could either be missing or barely present in a tradition; such absences do not make it any less of a tradition. Attempts to encapsulate traditions as \u0026lsquo;beliefs\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;rituals\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;festivals\u0026rsquo; is to distort their nature, as I will argue.\nWhat exactly is transmitted by a tradition? Even though we assume that a set of practices from time immemorial is transmitted, in principle, there is no way of establishing the truth of this belief. If we look at India, we believe that some rituals, some mantras, the ways of reciting the vedas and so on are accurately transmitted from generation to generation. We might even have good reasons to believe this (because of the pathashaalas and the teachers). However, we can go no further than this. Mostly, our grandparents (at best) and our parents (at worst) transmit these practices: there is very little external authority to go by. Changes will have occurred and practices will have adapted themselves to ways of living. In this sense, traditions are extremely dynamic and flexible. So, we receive our inheritance in the belief that it is our tradition. We modify (here and there) what we receive and transmit them to our children. Traditions can live precisely because of their adaptability; they are never static.\nWho belongs to a tradition? Consider the fact that my father never performed any of the daily rituals, hardly visited temples and had some kind of an indifferent attitude (for a long time) towards festivals and celebrations which my mother performed. Consider the fact that I continue in his footsteps, smoke and drink, have consumed all varieties of meat but, unlike my father or my mother, I have gone deep into a study of Indian traditions and culture. Do we belong to our tradition or not\u0026rsquo; Quite outside of the fact that there is no authority to pronounce on this issue, our traditions allow even such people as my father and me to belong to the Indian traditions. That is to say, belonging to a tradition is a fine-grained affair; it is not an all-or-none situation. When born into one, there is no way of determining who belongs to a tradition and who does not. By the same token, people not born into a tradition can also be inducted into it. The criteria of induction are fine-graded affairs as well.\nHowever, the above does not suggest that traditions are either fluid or amorphous. They are anything but that. It is extremely crucial that traditions distinguish each other as traditions.The Veera Shaiva tradition is not just a Shaiva tradition; the Vishistaadwaitins are not merely Dwaitas. Each one of them is not only distinct from the other but also strives to retain its distinction. While Advaitins say that \u0026lsquo;all is Brahman\u0026rsquo;, they do so by being different from all the above traditions. Being different from the other traditions is crucial to being a tradition. To a large extent, the vibrancy of a tradition is indexed by the extent to which it is able to retain its difference from other traditions. Today, we are not yet able to make sense of the presence of these two properties: (a) the enormous flexibility in belonging to a tradition and the sharpness with which the boundaries between traditions are drawn; (b) the possibility that any element could be absent from a tradition and yet the necessity for it to maintain a sense of identity and distinction. Depending on where one\u0026rsquo;s emphasis lies, traditions appear both very elastic and extremely dogmatic simultaneously. If one uses these terms to describe traditions, we can conclude that one is describing them as though they are variants of religions or philosophies. They are not: traditions are neither religions nor philosophies; they are what they are, viz. traditions.\nWhy practice a tradition? Though this question appears reasonable at first sight, it is not: it is both loaded in favor of the Semitic religions and ill-formed. To understand why it is both, we need to take a short detour.\nSuppose that you come across someone who says the following: \u0026lsquo;I have no reason to live.\u0026rsquo; Would the recommendation, \u0026lsquo;go and commit suicide then\u0026rsquo; be apt in such a case\u0026rsquo; Quite apart from humane considerations, there is one reason why the response would fail to be appropriate. It commits a fallacy: from the claim that one does not have a reason to live, it does not logically follow that, therefore, one has a reason to commit suicide. Even if one does not have a reason to live, one can continue to live; an independent reason is required to commit suicide.\nIn more general terms, a practice does not require a separate \u0026lsquo;reason\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;justification\u0026rsquo; for its existence. In exactly the same way one does not require a reason to continue to live, one does not need a reason to continue a practice. The existence of a practice is its \u0026lsquo;justification\u0026rsquo;; the only \u0026lsquo;reason\u0026rsquo; to practice a tradition is the fact that what is practiced is a tradition. So, to the question, \u0026lsquo;why do Ganesha puja?\u0026rsquo; the following is an answer: \u0026lsquo;because I have learnt to do this puja.\u0026rsquo; \u0026lsquo;Why wear bindis?\u0026rsquo;: \u0026lsquo;we wear them because it is our practice.\u0026rsquo; Nothing more is required.\nDoes that mean that all practices are justified because they are ancestral practices? (For example, meting out inhuman treatment to fellow human beings: is this justified because one\u0026rsquo;s ancestors did something like this\u0026rsquo;) No, this claim does not follow logically: if there are good reasons why one should abandon or modify a practice, then, if one is reasonable, one either modifies a practice or abandons it altogether. That is to say, reason acts as a critical brake on the excesses of human practice. No Indian tradition has ever denied this crucial role to reason.\nIf, for example, one is a Jew or Christian or Muslim, then one believes that by worshipping idols, icons, and images, one is worshipping the Devil. Their (Biblical) God has told them (they claim) that if people worship the Devil, they will rot in Hell for all eternity. If someone believes this set of claims and does not want to rot in Hell, such a person has good reasons not to do puja to Ganesha. To a believer from these religions, idol worship is a Sin because God has forbidden it and threatened those who practice it with the ultimate punishment possible: condemnation to Hell. So, we can imagine them telling us that idol worship is one of the greatest Sins. But that is no good reason for us to abandon doing the so-called \u0026lsquo;murthipuja\u0026rsquo;. It is a part of our tradition to do puja to the statue of Ganesha and we do it because it is our tradition.\nSo, those who challenge us and ask, \u0026lsquo;why practice a tradition\u0026rsquo;\u0026rsquo; are asking us to commit a logical fallacy, if they presume that one needs a \u0026lsquo;reason\u0026rsquo; for doing a practice. This makes the question ill-formed. But something else is present as well. They are also asking, \u0026lsquo;Why one ought to continue a practice?\u0026rsquo; That is, \u0026lsquo;why is it obligatory to continue a tradition?\u0026rsquo; The answer is fairly simple: there is no compulsion or obligation; no reason why one \u0026lsquo;ought to\u0026rsquo; practice a tradition. Think of the answer your parents or grandparents gave, when you challenged them when you were twenty or older, why you \u0026lsquo;should\u0026rsquo; go to the temple or why you should perform the rituals. They merely shrugged their shoulders, even if unhappy with your attitude. \u0026lsquo;Moksha\u0026rsquo; is not denied to you if you do not go to the temples or fail to celebrate Ganesha Chaturthi. This is also the answer to the query why one ought to do puja. No such reason and no such compulsion exist in the Indian traditions.\nHowever, that is not the case with the Semitic religions. They worship their (Biblical) God in certain ways because this (Biblical) God has imposed on them the obligation to do so. If they fail, they go to Hell for all eternity. According to them, human beings exist on earth for one reason only: to worship and obey (the Biblical) God. This is the sole purpose of human existence. (The Biblical) God has created the Universe and human beings so that the latter might worship Him only in the way He wants to be worshipped. If you do anything else instead, you earn a one-way ticket to Hell. Therefore, they have a \u0026lsquo;reason\u0026rsquo; to worship their (Biblical) God: His Commandment to worship Him and only Him in the way He wants. How do we human beings know how He wants to be worshipped? This is where their \u0026lsquo;revelation\u0026rsquo; comes in: He has told how He should be worshipped in \u0026rsquo;the Scriptures\u0026rsquo;, which is the word of (the Biblical) God. Scriptures to them are (the Biblical) God\u0026rsquo;s revelations, i.e. they are (the Biblical) God\u0026rsquo;s commandments. To believe in the word of this entity is to hope for salvation; not believing it is to be doomed to Hell for all eternity.\nBecause this is their religion, they want to know what \u0026rsquo;the Hindus\u0026rsquo; believe in. They think we have \u0026lsquo;Scriptures\u0026rsquo; the way they have theirs. They think that our ways of \u0026lsquo;worshipping\u0026rsquo; (which is what they think puja is) express our beliefs about how \u0026lsquo;God\u0026rsquo; (they speak of \u0026lsquo;God\u0026rsquo; in the singular and they have only their Biblical God in mind) \u0026lsquo;ought\u0026rsquo; to be worshipped. Of course, they are convinced that we believe in \u0026rsquo;the truth\u0026rsquo; of, say, Ramayana or Mahabharata the way they believe in the \u0026rsquo;truth\u0026rsquo; of their stories about the Temple of Solomon, Jesus of Nazareth, and Mohammad. If the temple of Solomon had never existed in what is today\u0026rsquo;s Israel, if Jesus of Nazareth was never born in today\u0026rsquo;s Middle East, if Mohammad turns out to have been crazy, these religions would simply cease to exist. They need these claims to be true, if they have to exist as religions at all.\nIn contrast, how is it with us? Until about two to three decades ago, until, that is, people started transforming \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; into a pale variant of these Semitic religions, the answer would have been pretty much the same all across India: \u0026lsquo;I do not know whether Rama and Ravana existed about a couple of thousand years ago or not; their existence or non-existence does not matter for Ramayana to be true\u0026rsquo;. (Of course, the attempt to portray Hinduism as a religion did not begin a few decades ago; it began under colonialism. But I will neglect that for the time being.) Some time ago, I came across a beautiful dialogue between a Balinese and a Swiss German precisely about this question. My mother could not have expressed it better (from Bichsel, Peter, 1982, Der Leser, Das Erz\u0026rsquo;hlen: Frankfurter Poetik-Vorlesungen. Darmstadt und Neuwied: Hermann Luchterhand Verlag. Pp. 13-14, my italics):\nWhen I discovered, or when it was explained to me, that Hinduism is a pedagogical religion, namely, that in so far as the best \u0026lsquo;good deed\u0026rsquo; of a Hindu consisted of explaining something or the other, I lost my inhibitions and began with questions…\nA young Balinese became my primary teacher. One day I asked him if he believed that the history of Prince Rama \u0026ndash;one of the holy books of the Hindus \u0026ndash; is true.\nWithout hesitation, he answered it with \u0026ldquo;Yes\u0026rdquo;.\n\u0026ldquo;So you believe that the Prince Rama lived somewhere and somewhen?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I do not know if he lived\u0026rdquo;, he said.\n\u0026ldquo;Then it is a story?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, it is a story.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Then someone wrote this story \u0026ndash;I mean: a human being wrote it?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Certainly some human being wrote it\u0026rdquo;, he said.\n\u0026ldquo;Then some human being could have also invented it\u0026rdquo;, I answered and felt triumphant, when I thought that I had convinced him.\nBut he said: \u0026ldquo;It is quite possible that somebody invented this story. But true it is, in any case.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Then it is the case that Prince Rama did not live on this earth\u0026rsquo;\u0026rsquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What is it that you want to know?\u0026rdquo; he asked. \u0026ldquo;Do you want to know whether the story is true, or merely whether it occurred?\u0026rsquo;\u0026rsquo;\n\u0026ldquo;The Christians believe that their God Jesus Christ was also on earth\u0026rdquo;, I said, \u0026ldquo;In the New Testament, it has been described by human beings. But the Christians believe that this is the description of the reality. Their God was also really on Earth.\u0026rdquo;\nMy Balinese friend thought it over and said: \u0026ldquo;I had been already so informed. I do not understand why it is important that your God was on earth, but it does strike me that the Europeans are not pious. Is that correct?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, it is\u0026rdquo;, I said.\nOf course, this attitude about Mahabharata and Ramayana is more intriguing than I can go into here. But let us notice that those with religion have great difficulties in understanding such an attitude. They think that we believe in the \u0026rsquo;truth\u0026rsquo; of puranic stories and that we replace our histories and geographies with them. That is why Sir Babbington Macaulay, in his famous minutes concerning the need for a British education system in India, spoke in these terms about us and our \u0026lsquo;beliefs\u0026rsquo;:\nIt is, I believe, no exaggeration to say that all the historical information that has been collected to form all the books written in the Sanskrit language is less valuable than what may be found in the most paltry abridgements used at preparatory schools in England. In every branch of physical or moral philosophy the relative position of these two nations is nearly the same…\nThe question before us is merely whether …we shall teach languages in which, by universal confession, there are no books on any subject which deserve to be compared to our own; whether, when we can teach European science, we shall teach systems which, by universal confession, whenever they differ from those of Europe, differ for the worse; and whether, when we can patronize true philosophy and sound history, we shall countenance, at the public expense, medical doctrines which would disgrace an English farrier \u0026ndash;astronomy, which would move laughter in girls at an English public school \u0026ndash;history, abounding with kings thirty feet high, and reigns thirty thousand years long\u0026ndash;and geography\u0026ndash; made up of seas of treacle and butter (cited in Keay, John, 1981, India Discovered. London: Collins, 1988: p. 77, my emphasis).\nHave the Indians ever believed that seas of butter really existed in some part of India (say in Bangalore of today) some two thousand years ago without either melting through heat or without milk playing a role in its production? Did we ever believe that some two thousand years ago, thirty foot high kings moved around (say in Delhi of today) and lived 30,000 years long\u0026rsquo; How we talk of yugas, kalpas and so on cannot simply be collapsed into some beliefs about the history of humanity of some two thousand years ago without making us appear as cretins and idiots. That is exactly what we do, when we start finding our \u0026lsquo;own scriptures\u0026rsquo;, our \u0026lsquo;own God\u0026rsquo; and our \u0026lsquo;own Ten Commandments\u0026rsquo; as an answer to the so-called critique of Judaism, Christianity and Islam. We do not need a \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo; of our \u0026lsquo;own\u0026rsquo;; we need no \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; as a religion, in order to find out what we are and who we are. If we insist on this transformation, know this for certain: you will have to say that most Indians and your ancestors were exactly the kind of morons that Macaulay described not so long ago.\nIn other words, both the colonial and the contemporary western descriptions of India and her traditions transform us into something worse than children. They make us into the mental retards of modernity. No amount of \u0026lsquo;symbolic\u0026rsquo; interpretation can take away the sting of the facts that one \u0026lsquo;interprets\u0026rsquo;: \u0026rsquo;the Indians worship the phallus, the cow, the monkey, the idol and the naked fakir.\u0026rsquo; We cannot instill pride in our children about their culture and traditions by telling them that these are all \u0026lsquo;manifestations of the Brahman\u0026rsquo;. If you try talking that way with them, you will not be able to answer their question, \u0026lsquo;why then not worship this Brahman directly without having to worship these disgusting things?\u0026rsquo; without making your ancestors and the rest of the Indians into cretins and morons. Often, truth liberates; and that is also the case now. Make them first understand that these questions have their roots in the Semitic religions and the contempt these religions have for the Indian traditions. Tell them subsequently that it is their task to figure out what \u0026lsquo;puja\u0026rsquo; is, because it is not \u0026lsquo;worship\u0026rsquo;. Of course, this requires honesty on our part: can we tell our children that we have failed in making sense of our traditions in the last few centuries and decades? Or, to save our faces, will we take recourse to feeding them with pseudo-answers about \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; as a \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo;, which allegedly hides profound and sublime truths under the loincloth of Shiva? Only time will tell whether we can face the problems we confront or stick our heads in the sand hoping that they will go away.\nQuintus Aurelius Symmachus was the last non-Christian Prefect of Rome around the end of the Fourth Century. In a letter to the Emperor Valentinian the Second, Symmachus requested a space for the Romans to practice their own traditions without being persecuted by the aggressive religion that Christianity was. Because this piece borrows his words for its title, I would like to end on a citation from that famous letter:\nGrant, I beg you, that what in our youth we took over from our fathers, we may in our old age hand on to posterity. The love of established practice is a powerful sentiment\u0026hellip;Everyone has his own customs, his own religious practices\u0026hellip;If long passage of time lends validity to religious observances, *we ought to keep faith with so many centuries, we ought to follow our forefathers who followed their forefathers and were blessed in so doing\u0026hellip;*And so we ask for peace for the gods of our fathers, for the gods of our native land. It is reasonable that whatever each of us worships is really to be considered one and the same. We gaze up at the same stars, the sky covers us all, the same universe compasses us. What does it matter what practical system we adopt in our search for truth\u0026rsquo; Not by one avenue only can we arrive at so tremendous a secret. (Barrow, R. H., Trans., 1973, Prefect and Emperor: The Relationes of Symmachus. A.D. 384. Oxford: The Clarendon Press, Pp. 37-41; my italics.)\nCheck the next article in this series: Why understand the Western culture?, and the article that preceded the one you have just read: Translations or Travesty of Traditions.\n","tags":[],"title":"To Follow Our Forefathers: The Nature of Tradition –S.N.Balagangadhara","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/to-follow-our-forefathers-the-nature-of-tradition-s-n-balagangadhara/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","india-forum","NRI","religion"],"content":"Let me begin this contribution, the third piece about our culture and traditions([1], [2]), by sharing something you are familiar with. Very often, I have heard the NRI parents in the USA making the following remark:\nWhen I came to the US so many decades ago, I knew very little about Hinduism. My ignorance was driven home when I had children and they began to ask what Hinduism was. Because I had to educate them, I ended up learning more about Hinduism in the US (thanks to this or that organization or Swami) than during all the years I spent in India.\nLet us reflect on this experience. When Indians come to the US, they feel that they are confronted by their ignorance (or their lack of knowledge) about \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo;. To account for this state of affairs, they could blame either their earlier lack of interest (in learning about their \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo; while they were in India) or the absence of education (in India) in this regard. Of course, neither of the two quite explains why they need explicit instruction in \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; in order to transmit traditions to their children. After all, the transmission of the Indian culture over the millennia depended (continues to depend) upon ordinary people who have \u0026rsquo;learnt\u0026rsquo; their traditions from their parents and peers, and not from any pundits. One\u0026rsquo;s \u0026lsquo;knowledge\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;ignorance\u0026rsquo; when one came to the US, in this sense, are comparable to the similar \u0026lsquo;knowledge\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;ignorance\u0026rsquo; of the ordinary Indians. In all probability, had they remained in India, their absence of knowledge would not have worried them as much as it worries them now. They would have transmitted their tradition and culture the way millions do in India: without any explicit instruction in the \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo; called \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo;. Peer groups, family circles, friends and relatives, would have also played a role in this process no doubt.\nHowever, what appears to work in India appears to fail when Indians come and settle down in the United States. Here, they feel the need for some sort of an explicit education about \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo;. Clearly, this is due to the environment they find themselves in: not only does their new environment not help in the transmission of the Indian culture and traditions but it also forces the individual Indian parents to school themselves in the Indian \u0026lsquo;religions\u0026rsquo; in a particular way. That is to say, unlike the Indian environment where cultural transmission can take place without an explicit education in their \u0026lsquo;religions\u0026rsquo;, people are forced to articulate what their religion is about when they come to live in the western culture. Therefore, unlike (most) of our parents and peers, Indians living in the West appear to face a different kind of challenge: come up with an explicit understanding of \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo;, if they intend to transmit their culture and traditions to their children as well.\nYet, it is my impression that what appears to work for them (namely, codifying \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; in terms of either its beliefs or practices, or by spelling out their \u0026lsquo;Ten Commandments\u0026rsquo;, etc) does not work for their children who are born and grow up in the United States: what satisfies the parents does not satisfy the needs of the children. While the parents are quite happy to meet in self-study classes, read Patanjali and feel good that they have arrived somewhere, because now they can talk about \u0026lsquo;pramaana\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;anumaana\u0026rsquo;, their children do not seem to share the parents\u0026rsquo; sanguinity. The children feel that they are left to fend for their own and face questions from their peers and teachers, which they do not understand or cannot answer.\nIn other words, there seem to be three different kinds of problems. First: the Indian ways of transmitting traditions and culture appear to break down, when Indians come and settle down in the West. Second: the Indians seem to feel the compulsion to codify their traditions in some form or another, because of the pressure exerted by the cultural milieu they live in. Third: such codifications, while they seem to satisfy the needs of the parents, do not appear to help the children in their daily interactions with their peers and society at large. Because of these three problems, a fourth problem also comes to the fore: such codifications have the tendency to downplay both the importance and the necessity of the kind of diversity and pluralism that the Indian traditions have.\nIn the current piece, I want to reflect on this situation. For the sake of convenience, I will assume that my impressions (and they are only that, impressions) are by and large true. I will furthermore also assume that they are true for many (if not all) Indians living in the West. I am interested in localizing the problems and seeking solutions for them; I am not interested in either apportioning blame or identifying the \u0026lsquo;culprits\u0026rsquo;. Even though I have some idea why such a situation has come about, I shall be mostly silent on this issue for the time being.\nSetting the Context\nWhen the British East India Company consolidated its hold over many parts of India and its administrators assumed the position of rulers, a very peculiar kind of hostility towards the Indian traditions became the hallmark of the colonial administrative policy. Of course, this hostility was there from the very beginning: in \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo;, the \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo; of the Hindus, they found everything that was reprehensible and repugnant. This hostility arose not merely because they \u0026lsquo;discovered\u0026rsquo; that some of the Indian practices were intolerable or immoral, like child marriage, sati and what-have-you. Their repulsion had a deeper root: their understanding of religion taught them that such perversions are integral to false religions. Because \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; was a false and degenerate religion, its perversions were not mere accidents but its necessary features.\nWe need to understand this well because the notion of false religion does not make sense to us. Therefore, let me put it in very simple terms. To the followers of the Semitic religions (Judaism, Christianity and Islam), only God can be the object of worship. When they speak of \u0026lsquo;God\u0026rsquo;, we need to keep two things very firmly in mind.\nThe first is this: this \u0026lsquo;God\u0026rsquo; is the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. According to their scriptures, (the biblical) God created the world (for instance, as it is described in the book on Genesis in the Old Testament Bible). He is the God of the Israelites (of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and their descendents), who punished the Jews, scattered them across the world for forgetting Him, and also promises to save them. In the hands of the Christians, (the biblical) God\u0026rsquo;s promise to save the Jews got transformed into the salvation of the entire humanity; the \u0026lsquo;God of Israel\u0026rsquo; also became the singular, unique and unqualified \u0026lsquo;God\u0026rsquo;, even though He continued to be the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. His promise, the Christians claimed, was redeemed in Jesus of Nazareth: Jesus was the promised messenger of this God. (\u0026lsquo;Christ\u0026rsquo; means the anointed one or the messiah.) The Jews did not think that Jesus of Nazareth was the Christ, whereas the followers of Jesus claimed that he was precisely that. (In this sense, one of the points of disagreement between the Christians and the Jews is about the status of Jesus of Nazareth: Is he the Christ or not? Has the Christ already come, as the Christians claim, or should one await his arrival, as the Jews insist?)\nThe second point is this. Satan, or the Devil, attempts continuously to seduce \u0026lsquo;people\u0026rsquo; to stray from the path of worshipping (the biblical) God. In the hands of the Christians, \u0026lsquo;people\u0026rsquo; refers to the entire humankind. Satan or the Devil (he has many names and his followers are \u0026rsquo;legion\u0026rsquo;) undertakes this task of seduction by making the credulous believe that he, the Devil, is the \u0026rsquo;true\u0026rsquo; (biblical) God. Of course, he is not the \u0026rsquo;true God\u0026rsquo;; he is the \u0026lsquo;false god\u0026rsquo;. In this task, he is immensely helped by the human followers of the Devil: the \u0026lsquo;priests\u0026rsquo;. These \u0026lsquo;priests\u0026rsquo; create all kinds of \u0026lsquo;rituals\u0026rsquo; and mumbo-jumbo, deceive the credulous, hide the \u0026rsquo;true message\u0026rsquo; of (the biblical) God, and so on and so forth. By doing all these, they encourage the ordinary people to worship the devil and his lieutenants: these are the \u0026lsquo;false gods\u0026rsquo;. So, we have one \u0026lsquo;True God\u0026rsquo; (the biblical God, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob) and multitudes of \u0026lsquo;false gods\u0026rsquo;. Because religion is the worship of God, we get two kinds of religions: the \u0026rsquo;true\u0026rsquo; religion that worships the \u0026rsquo;true God\u0026rsquo; and false religions that worship the \u0026lsquo;false gods\u0026rsquo;.\nTo the British Christians (and to the Islamic rulers before them), the \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo; of the Hindus could only be false religion. Our devas and devis were false gods and merely different representations of the Devil and his lieutenants. To the Protestants (and to most of the Catholic missionaries), such a false religion could only be understood in terms of the seductive power of the Devil and the machinations of Devil\u0026rsquo;s \u0026lsquo;priests\u0026rsquo;, viz., the Brahmins. Such a false religion not only delivered the credulous into the clutches of the Devil and sent them on a one-way ticket to hell, but it also had to be intrinsically immoral. Consequently, any phenomenon they thought they saw in India, whether it was sati or child marriage, had to do with the immorality of \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; and the wickedness of the priests of this false religion. They believed that such a false religion could only exist because a cunning and devious group of people (these are the \u0026lsquo;priests\u0026rsquo; of such false religions) succeeds in deceiving the majority: in the Brahmins, they found such a layer of \u0026lsquo;priests\u0026rsquo;. How did these priests gain and maintain their power? In the \u0026lsquo;caste system\u0026rsquo;, they found the answer to this riddle. Somehow, the Brahmin priests invented the \u0026lsquo;caste system\u0026rsquo; and somehow they imposed this immoral system on the larger society. Thus, this \u0026lsquo;caste system\u0026rsquo; became an integral part of the false religion that \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; was.\nYou must remember that the foundation and the framework of these \u0026lsquo;discoveries\u0026rsquo; were not empirical investigations but their theological beliefs. Everything they \u0026lsquo;discovered\u0026rsquo; was fitted into this framework. The discovery of the Upanishads and the Buddhist (and the Jain) traditions merely strengthened the framework. Thus, they came up with the three stages of the decay and degeneration of \u0026lsquo;Indian religion\u0026rsquo;: Vedic religion, Brahmanism and Hinduism. The Vedic religion retained the intimations of (the Biblical) God and His original message; Brahmanism was the corruption and decay of this religion in the hands of the Brahmin priests; \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; is a further degeneration and corruption of the already corrupt religion of Brahmanism. The Buddha fought the \u0026lsquo;Brahmin priests\u0026rsquo; and, because of this, in the eyes of the Protestants, \u0026lsquo;Buddhism\u0026rsquo; was less \u0026lsquo;corrupt\u0026rsquo; than Brahmanism. But \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; was the most degenerate and corrupt \u0026lsquo;false religion\u0026rsquo;, which, unfortunately, was embraced by the majority of the gullible in India.\nTherefore, all the ills of Indian society and culture were traced back to \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo;. They are intrinsic to this religion, the British claimed, and integral parts of the same. Lie, when repeated often enough, becomes the truth; nonsense, when propagated widely, begins to make sense. Such is the case with respect to the story about the Indian \u0026lsquo;religions\u0026rsquo;, especially \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo;.\nDrawing a Parallel\nThe Indian intellectuals of yesteryears swallowed this story wholesale. (The \u0026lsquo;why\u0026rsquo; is a very big question, which I shall ignore in this piece.) Thus, two extreme reactions came into existence: at one end of the spectrum, some people wanted to \u0026lsquo;reform\u0026rsquo; the religion of the Hindus. They wanted to go back to the \u0026lsquo;purer\u0026rsquo; religion of the Vedas and the Upanishads. At the other end of the spectrum, rabid defenders of \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; also came into existence. As is usual in such cases, any number of intermediate positions between these two extremes also crystallized.\nThe \u0026lsquo;reformers\u0026rsquo; tried to build a purer form of Hinduism: they accepted that the pujas in the temples and at home constituted \u0026lsquo;idol worship\u0026rsquo; and, therefore, were intolerable; they discovered that, indeed, the Upanishads did not talk about the \u0026lsquo;rituals\u0026rsquo; that the people practiced and, therefore, the \u0026lsquo;Brahmin\u0026rsquo; priests had corrupted this purer religion of the Indians; and so on. Having agreed with the British about almost everything they said, these intellectuals began the process of constructing a pure religion called \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; that was modeled upon their understanding of Protestant Christianity. They discovered the \u0026lsquo;Nirguana Brahma\u0026rsquo; that some people had spoken of earlier; they found out that the Indians too had spoken of \u0026lsquo;God\u0026rsquo; in the singular; etc. In short, their only \u0026lsquo;disagreement\u0026rsquo; with the Protestant Christians was this: could the \u0026lsquo;Indian religion\u0026rsquo; be reformed to resemble some or another respectable variant of Christianity or not\u0026rsquo; The Brahmo Samaj, the Arya Samaj, the Prarthana Samaj, etc. began to create \u0026lsquo;respectable\u0026rsquo; versions of \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; that would not overly shock the sensibilities of Protestant Christians. Like all \u0026lsquo;respectable religions\u0026rsquo;, these versions of Hinduism identified its \u0026lsquo;scriptures\u0026rsquo; and codified them into clear sets of beliefs; they also had \u0026lsquo;God\u0026rsquo; at the centre of their \u0026lsquo;doctrines\u0026rsquo;; had their own versions of \u0026rsquo;ethical commandments\u0026rsquo; and their \u0026lsquo;vocation\u0026rsquo; of service to fellow-human beings. And, much like their Protestant brethren, they wanted to \u0026lsquo;reform\u0026rsquo; Hinduism, abolish \u0026rsquo;the caste system\u0026rsquo; (and all such ills), and looked down upon the \u0026lsquo;ignorant\u0026rsquo; mass of the Indians who were not knowledgeable about the subtle tenets of the Upanishadic doctrines and were sunk in superstitious practices.\nEven though these reformers were intolerant of the Indian culture and its manifold traditions, the rest of India tolerated them as yet another contribution to the variety and diversity of the Indian traditions. The Arya samaji\u0026rsquo;s, for instance, were as much \u0026lsquo;Hindus\u0026rsquo; as the \u0026lsquo;Vaishnavites\u0026rsquo; were; the differences between them merely exemplified the different paths that India had been used to over the millennia. So, these reformers could survive too, the way many others before them had survived.\nWhen the British noticed that the majority of Indians are ignorant of their scriptures, the reformers tried to respond to this by going back to some texts from their traditions; when the British criticized this or that practice, the reformers tried to modify or replace that practice; when the British thought that Indians were immoral, the reformers tried to come up with a set of moral rules from their texts to show that \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; could be moral as well? In many ways, these reformers merely acquiesced to the demands and criticisms of the British and tried to sculpt a \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; that could meet the criticisms. However, in the midst of all these, they failed in doing that one thing which would have helped them: understand the culture of the British and the nature of their religiously inspired criticisms. They merely assumed that the British were justified in the criticisms of the \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; of their time and tried to show that underneath the contemporary corruption, a \u0026lsquo;purer\u0026rsquo; form of religion was waiting to be found. In this too, even where they did not know this well, they followed the British and European portrayal of India and the degeneration of her \u0026lsquo;religions\u0026rsquo;.\nWhy is this story important to us today? There are two reasons. The first is this: the portrayals of the Indian culture and the nature of her traditions, which the western culture has provided over the centuries, have become standard text-book trivia today. Even though the picture the West has painted is incomprehensible without presupposing the truth of the Christian doctrines, the claims about the so-called \u0026lsquo;religions\u0026rsquo; of India appear comprehensible even to those who do not know anything about Christianity. Intellectuals in the West and in India believe in the truth of the western descriptions of the Indian culture. Most of us in the West believe that \u0026rsquo;the caste system\u0026rsquo; exists in India; that the Brahmins have oppressed the so-called \u0026lsquo;Dalits\u0026rsquo; in India over the millennia; that Buddhism was a rebellion against the \u0026lsquo;ritualistic\u0026rsquo; domination of the Brahmin priests; and so on. Indian intellectuals believe in this story as well: witness our \u0026lsquo;reservation policy\u0026rsquo; and the \u0026lsquo;conversion\u0026rsquo; of the so-called \u0026lsquo;Dalits\u0026rsquo; into \u0026lsquo;Buddhism\u0026rsquo;, as mere examples of our commitment to the truth of these western stories about India.\nThere is an additional reason as well. Today, most Indians in the West respond to the questions and challenges posed by their milieu the way the Indian reformers responded to the British criticisms and challenges. In which way are our responses today similar (if not identical) to those of the reformers from yesterday?\nTwo Different Ways\nConsider the following questions, which are routinely asked about our culture in the West. Why do you wear bindi?; Why do you not eat beef?; Is it true that you worship the phallus?; What do you think about the caste-system?; Do they still burn widows in India?; Why do your gods have six or eight arms?; What is your religious symbol?; Do you worship that statue in that temple?; Do you believe in God?; Are you religious? And so on and so forth. What does one do when one faces these questions?\nBroadly speaking, there are two ways of responding to this situation. The first would be to try and answer these questions assuming, in the process, that (a) the questions are intelligible and that (b) one understands them. This is the route chosen by most of us and the Indian reformers. We now need to notice what happens if we tread this route today because, unlike the reformers of yesteryears, our milieu is not the Indian but the western culture.\nThe first requirement, of course, is that we come up with satisfactory answers. However, satisfactory for whom though? Should it satisfy us, the first generation Indians in the West, or our children, the second generation Indians, or the questioner? Consider, as an example, one of the oft-heard answers to the question about not eating beef which goes as follows: Indians are nourished by cow\u0026rsquo;s milk which is akin to being breast-fed by the mother; therefore, most Indians consider the cow as their mother. Hence, they do not slaughter cows and eat beef. (Or cattle are crucial to the survival of the Indian peasantry; hence they do not slaughter and eat them; or any number of such \u0026rsquo;explanations\u0026rsquo;.) Needless to say, this answer is satisfying neither to the questioner nor to most second generation Indian children. In India, one sees people beating cows and throwing stones at them, which is hardly an expression of \u0026lsquo;reverence\u0026rsquo; to the mother figure that the cow is alleged to be; no Indian goes around feeding his \u0026lsquo;mother\u0026rsquo; when he sees the cow foraging for food on the streets; furthermore, at first sight, it also appears an irrational answer: surely, people dying of starvation is of greater consequence than abstaining from eating beef. Is it not possible to reduce starvation and hunger in India, if people were \u0026lsquo;allowed\u0026rsquo; to eat beef? To questions like these, one has to come up with all kinds of convoluted answers, which leave most unsatisfied. Alternately, one takes the route of the Jews and the Muslims: we are forbidden from eating beef for \u0026lsquo;religious reasons\u0026rsquo;, in the same way the Muslims do not eat pork and the Jews want only \u0026lsquo;kosher\u0026rsquo; food. This answer will work only so long as one does not meet someone well-versed in the history of India. When such a person comes up with textual evidence that there was no prohibition against meat (including beef) in the early Indian \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo; then one gets well and truly stuck.\nHowever, the presence of such multiplicity of answers is itself an occasion for embarrassment. Why do different \u0026lsquo;Hindus\u0026rsquo; give different answers to questions like the above? Here is where the new cultural milieu exerts pressure for standardizing the answers. Some questions like \u0026lsquo;why do Hindu women wear bindi on their foreheads\u0026rsquo;? might allow for some leeway regarding the answers; some others, like \u0026lsquo;why do you worship phallus\u0026rsquo;? does not appear to do so.\nThe standardization of answers seeks to impose uniformity across the variety that characterizes the Indian traditions. These answers not only codify but they also strengthen (among some) another typical tendency of all immigrants, namely, the tendency to accentuate one\u0026rsquo;s practices and beliefs and to hold them both rigidly. One tends to hold on to the real or remembered practices of one\u0026rsquo;s ancestors even more rigidly than one\u0026rsquo;s own ancestors (or the Indians in India) and to become a super-orthodox \u0026lsquo;Hindu\u0026rsquo;.\nThis codification of beliefs and a rigid attempt to transplant into a totally different milieu a set of local practices, which might or might not have worked in India, encourages the fossilization of human practices. Instead of being an expression of the dynamic adaptation of human beings to their environments, human practices become rigid and, as such, require justifications. Such justifications can only be provided by a highly dogmatic set of beliefs formulated by this or that institution or Swami. Thus, a \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; that resembles the Semitic religions comes into existence.\nNeedless to say, such a \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; becomes even more vulnerable to challenges from the new cultural milieu. Now, the diversity and multiplicity of the Indian traditions are counter-posed to it and Hindu Americans are being accused of dogmatic orthodoxy. The same milieu which appears to force one to come up with a recognizably Semitic version of Hinduism sharply criticizes all attempts at doing so.\nThere are many more things to be said about this process but I shall have the occasion to return to these issues later. For the time being, all we need to notice is this: this way of responding to the western milieu merely forces us in the direction that the Hindu reformers took. However, unlike them, we do not live in a milieu generated by the Indian culture. That is to say, the \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; that we would sustain in the cultural milieu of the West would be even worse than that created by the reformers of yesteryears. It would resemble their \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo;, because of the attempts to codify beliefs. It would be worse than that, because we would end up rigidly adhering to some sets of practices. We would sacrifice the very vitality that characterizes the Indian traditions, which allowed them to survive over the millennia and in different environments.\nHow can we avoid these and other assorted ills and yet continue to practice our traditions in the West? To answer this problem, let me begin by raising the following question. Why are most of these questions not raised in India by us or our fellow \u0026lsquo;Hindus\u0026rsquo;? I mean to say, why do we not go around asking questions about eating beef, wearing bindi, worshipping the Shiva Linga, and such like in India? Surely, it is not because we know the answers: if we did, we would have no problems in providing the same answers to our western interlocutors. Here is a simple but a very important point: it does not occur to us to raise these questions about our traditions. It does not occur to us, not because we are any less curious or intelligent than people in the western culture, but because such questions do not make sense in our cultural milieu. That is to say, we learn not to ask such questions about our traditions and this learning is a part of learning to become a member of the Indian traditions. Of course, when I say that we do not ask such questions, it does not mean that we have never raised such questions at any point in our lives: as children, we raised them and the answers satisfied us. Most of these answers referred to the nature of our inherited practices.\nIn other words, when we confront such questions in the western culture, we need to understand two things: (a) these questions force and compel us to provide a particular kind of answers; (b) they do not make sense in the Indian culture, but are eminently sensible in the western culture. That is to say, when such questions are asked of the Indian traditions, we should not assume that these are intelligible to us; they are not. It is in the nature of the western culture to raise such questions.\nAlmost all of us, who are successful in the West, assume that we understand the western culture. The reason for this assumption is our ability to be successful in the West. Furthermore, we also assume that we know what these questions mean just because we speak and understand English (or European languages). I would like to submit to you that this assumption is false: we have not understood the western culture at all.\nOne of the most important consequences of my claim is this: when the western culture quizzes us about the nature of the Indian traditions, this culture is telling us about itself. To provide satisfactory answers to our interlocutors about our traditions does not require that we read the Upanishads or Patanjali; it does not require that we come up with our own \u0026lsquo;Ten Commandments\u0026rsquo; or a poorly spun theology. We need to understand the nature of western culture. Simply put: to answer questions about the Indian traditions, we need to understand the western culture.\nThis is what the reformers did not understand; this is what we do not understand either. The questions that the West raises are rooted in their culture. Consequently, if we want our children to confront this milieu with confidence, more than anything else, we need to teach them about the western culture. We need to make them understand why the West raises such questions and what these mean. Currently, they understand neither. We need not teach them \u0026rsquo;the\u0026rsquo; answers to such questions; they will figure out on their own which answers are appropriate. However, we need to make them understand what the Western culture \u0026lsquo;means\u0026rsquo; when its members ask us whether \u0026rsquo;the Hindus believe in God\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;what the religious symbol of the Hindus are\u0026rsquo; and why \u0026rsquo;the Hindus worship the penis and the monkey\u0026rsquo;.\nTo sum up: while we live in the West, we are forced into creating a rigid and codified \u0026lsquo;Hinduism as a religion\u0026rsquo;, much like the reformers of yesteryears. While such constructions surely have their place in the variety and diversity that characterizes the Indian traditions, they neither solve nor address the problem that our children confront. Our children, much like us, do not understand either the culture they are living in or how to respond to some of its challenges. This situation defines our basic task: to teach our children about the West while we pass on our traditions to them. The question we have to ask ourselves is this: how successful have we been in doing both?\nCheck the other two articles in this series published on the India-forum site: (a) To Follow Our Forefathers: the Nature of Tradition; (b) Translations or Travesty of Traditions\nComments bennedose — 2014-07-21 09:17:00\nWhen I read of Greek descriptions of Indian religion and Al Beruni\u0026rsquo;s description, I get the impression that Hindus in that era were self confident about their beliefs and practices and not apologetic and seeking to please.\nIt is very likely that British scholars questioned Hindu reformers as masters talking to subjects, and the latter were under pressure to please rather than offend. It is likely also that anything that caused offence would be dismissed as further proof that Indian beliefs and practices were definitely the devils work.\nit occurs to me that Hindus after 1947, and Hindus in the west have retained that same attitude of apology and reticence. And it is these attitudes that are being handed down to their children.\nAfter all, you rightly point out that Hindu beliefs and practices are not \u0026ldquo;taught\u0026rdquo; in India and no one questions them either. In fact no one questions why one must wash oneself after defecation. One could ask in the west why they wipe and not wash. People in the west don\u0026rsquo;t question themselves about why they wipe and don\u0026rsquo;t wash - it is simply a cultural trait. Hindu beliefs and practices are similarly cultural traits, and are varied because they are unrestricted. There are no limits on what one must believe or profess. Freedom of choice. It is a matter of personal choice that is difficult to understand for a person who has been taught about one God and a religion dependent moral code while he was being taught to wipe himself.\nperrocomedor — 2014-07-28 00:38:00\nWhat questions are considered to make sense is not so much a property of the milieu as it is an artifact of the direction of the gaze. Both in India and in the West, the gaze is from the Westerner to the Hindu; it is up to the Hindu to explain himself to the Westerner in both cases.\n\u0026ldquo;Understanding of Western culture\u0026rdquo; therefore is a matter of learning to reverse the gaze; it is important to state this, otherwise Hindus might nerd out for years trying to master (largely irrelevant, unless one is specializing) details about Western culture and religion. A superficial knowledge of the bare elements of Westerrn religion and culture (for syntactic purposes) along with a conscious decision to reverse the gaze should suffice.\nTaking Christianity as an example, there are unanswerable questions when a Hindu gazes at a Christian (let us say Catholic for this example): Why do you people do symbolic human sacrifice and eat the flesh and drink the blood of the sacrificial victim every Sunday? Isn\u0026rsquo;t that barbaric and disgusting?\nThe reason this question gets asked hardly at all is only superficially because Hindus lack the understanding that Christianity is founded on a human sacrifice model of religion. The core reason is that it doesn\u0026rsquo;t occur to us that the question can be asked; once we recognize the possibility of asking the question and embrace it, the tiny bit of information required to formulate the question is readily available from the public domain.\nWhat happens in a mutually-respectful world in which the gaze has equal status in both directions? Then, probably, the honest answer to both the question about symbolic phallus worship and the question about symbolic human flesh consumption would be to to say, \u0026ldquo;I am sorry but I cannot answer that question truthfully as it would be rude to do so, inasmuch as the truthful answer is that, by asking that question, you have shown that you would be incapable of properly understanding my answer.\u0026rdquo;\nBoth symbolic phallus worship and symbolic human flesh consumption, as practices are irrelevant to Hinduism and Christianity respectively. What each is actually worshipping is the sanctity attaching to those respective symbols due to millennia over which humans worshipped those things. It is the implicit awareness of this fact imbuing Indian culture (of every religious persuasion) that is the secret of India\u0026rsquo;s famed and unique feature, variously known as pluralism, tolerance and so on. When that feature does work as advertised, obviously.\n","tags":[],"title":"Why Understand the Western Culture?","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/why-understand-the-western-culture-s-n-balagangadhara/"},{"categories":["concept(category)","translation","explication"],"content":"In our daily life, we hardly pause to reflect upon many problematic things that we routinely assume as self-evident. Such an attitude is useful since it allows us to focus on other things that occupy us at that moment. One such attitude is not to bestow too much care on how we use language: we routinely speak of similarity in meaning, identical concepts, exact and accurate translations and so on. As long as issues like meaning etc. are not at dispute, talking like this causes no harm. However, in the current case, we are talking about the meaning of \u0026lsquo;meaning\u0026rsquo; (in a manner of speaking). Consequently, we have to be careful about how we use language to convey what we want to say, and be clear about what thesis we intend to argue for.\nResponding to my explanation about the \u0026lsquo;indeterminacy in meaning\u0026rsquo; when it comes to translating across two languages, you say: \u0026ldquo;If that is true, I would think it is easily extendable to one language itself, it is impossible to know if two words are synonyms in the same language.\u0026rdquo; 1.1. I would very much like to see this extension that you speak of. Kindly keep in mind, when you do so, that we have a native speaker of the language in mind.\n1.2. I never said or implied (nor does Quine) that it is \u0026ldquo;impossible\u0026rdquo; to know if two words are synonyms in the same language. If I want to know the synonym for a particular word in the English language, I look up a dictionary and my problem is solved. So much about the alleged impossibility; do you really think that Quine does not know this?\n1.3. Of course, there is another kind of puzzle involved here. It involves the concept of meaning, and the problem of synonyms merely highlights it. What kind of an entity or thing is \u0026ldquo;meaning\u0026rdquo; that it can have (a) shades (like in \u0026ldquo;shades of meaning\u0026rdquo;); (b) allow for the logical relation of identity (like in \u0026ldquo;identical meaning\u0026rdquo;); (c) allow for some kind of measurement (as in \u0026ldquo;exact\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;inexact\u0026rdquo; translation) and so on. To answer this question, we need a theory of meaning that tells us what meaning is so that it is capable of all these things. In our state of knowledge, unfortunately, we have no satisfactory theory.\n1.4. Further, we are puzzled about meaning of words and sentences in natural languages (like English, Kannada, and so on) and not in artificial languages (logic, mathematics, and so on). In the latter, we define some symbols either implicitly (through axioms) or explicitly (by using other symbols) or operationally (by specifying some actions like measurement) etc. There is no problem in calling such definitions as the meaning of some symbols (whether or not they are words from some or another natural language or newly coined for a purpose) in analogy with natural languages. Given this, your example of electron simply fails in illustrating the kind of problems that we confront in translating across two languages. The theory about electrons (say, a theory in physics) is not translated into Hindi and Gujarati (even though a text book in physics could be translated from English to German). One could retain the word \u0026rsquo;electron\u0026rsquo; as a technical word, or use a Hindi word, or use \u0026lsquo;pif-paf\u0026rsquo; in Kannada. It makes no difference because the meaning of this symbol is exactly and univocally defined in that scientific theory. One merely carries this definition into Hindi or Marathi and this definition of the symbol exhausts the meaning of the same. We do not have an analogous theory either about natural languages, or about meaning, or about the meaning of words in some or another natural language.\nYou say: \u0026ldquo;The issue is not of finding an equivalent word in English; the issue is of finding an equivalent concept.\u0026rdquo; This is where some stringency is required in the use of words. If we use the word \u0026lsquo;concept\u0026rsquo; as a synonym for the word \u0026lsquo;meaning\u0026rsquo;, what are you saying? That we need an \u0026ldquo;equivalent concept\u0026rdquo; in English, or that we need some word that \u0026ldquo;means\u0026rdquo; the same as another word in English, or something else?\nNow comes your example about electron, which I have already spoken of before. \u0026ldquo;To take a trivial example, \u0026ldquo;electron\u0026rdquo; has a very specific experimental and mathematical physics meaning. If you learn physics and I don\u0026rsquo;t care what your first, second, third, etc., languages are, the \u0026ldquo;electron\u0026rdquo; is the same thing, and any human within a reasonably wide range of mental capabilities can identify it as such without any ambiguity. (So much for Quine, at best his argument can be that there exist some words which cannot be disambiguated). Otherwise, we\u0026rsquo;re rendering the enterprise of physics meaningless.\u0026rdquo;\nPlease keep in mind that \u0026ldquo;electron\u0026rdquo; is defined very precisely in a theory and that this definition also exhausts what that word means in that theory. This theory is the same (because the terms occurring in that theory are defined in that theory) irrespective of the natural language we use in teaching that theory. Please do not confuse this with an entirely different problem of translating across two natural languages.\nQuine never said that symbols cannot be defined in a very precise way: he has made original contributions to set theory and mathematical logic, for heaven\u0026rsquo;s sake! I can also define any word in any natural language with any degree of precision. But it will merely tell you how I am using that word. (Consider this \u0026lsquo;precise\u0026rsquo; definition of \u0026lsquo;dharma\u0026rsquo;: dharma= square root of the natural number four. So? Perhaps, you have forgotten the entire eighth chapter of \u0026lsquo;The heathen\u0026hellip;\u0026rsquo; where I have talked about definitions.) What Quine said is that when we translate across two natural languages, there is always indeterminacy with respect to the meaning of the translated words. It is foolish to ask for \u0026ldquo;precise and exact\u0026rdquo; translations of words from one natural language into another natural language because we do not know what it would mean to comply with that demand.\nYou say, while disagreeing with me completely that: \u0026ldquo;then it is appropriate to coin a new word in English or borrow Dharma into English. I do not have to find another English word that suits better than religion, any more than a 18th century translator into Hindi of a 20th century physics textbook that transported back in time, has to find a suitable word in Hindi; the translator has to recognize that this is something entirely foreign to the Hindi world of the 18th century.\u0026rdquo; I again have difficulty in following the drift of your argument. The first part of your first sentence says: \u0026ldquo;If Dharma is a missing English concept, like \u0026ldquo;electron\u0026rdquo; in 18th century Hindi\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Meaning exactly what? (I do not know what it means to speak of English, French, German and Kannada concepts. I can understand you if you say that there is no English word to translate the Sanskrit word Dharma because the concept of Dharma cannot be expressed in the English language. This is how I will read you.) How are you going to discover that \u0026ldquo;Dharma\u0026rdquo; is a missing English concept?\nYou compound confusions by talking about electron on the one hand (which, I repeat, is a symbol defined precisely in a theory) and about translating a text book of physics into Hindi on the other. The problems of the Hindi translator are of two different kinds: (a) does the world of physics know of the concept of electron in the eighteenth century? (b) Which word (should it be a Hindi word, or the word electron itself, or call it pif-paf) should be used when translating the text book into Hindi? He is not translating the theory in question into another language; if he was doing it, he will give a definition of, say, \u0026ldquo;paramanu\u0026rdquo; which is different from the definition of \u0026ldquo;electron\u0026rdquo; and not look for a different word or use another symbol. That is to say, he will retain what does the defining (which specifies the meaning of the word) but merely uses another word or symbol for that which is being defined. That is why, both \u0026lsquo;pif-paf\u0026rsquo; and \u0026rsquo;electron\u0026rsquo; can be identical in meaning because they can be defined in exactly the same way by some theory.\nYou say: \u0026ldquo;We easily note that \u0026ldquo;Dharma\u0026rdquo; cannot be equal \u0026ldquo;religion\u0026rdquo; because e.g., a \u0026ldquo;non-religious\u0026rdquo; government makes sense, and is a good we all seek, while an adharmic\u0026rdquo; government requires removal as soon as possible. We don\u0026rsquo;t need any significant philosophy for this.\u0026quot;\nAh, the virtues of philosophy! Here is where you demonstrate its need. Let us say, for the sake of argument, that a natural language dictionary (Sanskrit-Sanskrit) identifies ten different meanings (or even ten different uses) of the word \u0026lsquo;Dharma\u0026rsquo;. One such use occurs in the context of your example. Now, as an English translator, while translating Manusmruti, I come across the word Dharma. The context in which this word occurs tells us that Dhrama is used here in such a way that that it corresponds (let us say) to the third meaning of that word (as defined by this Sanskrit-Sanskrit dictionary). I also know (both as a native speaker of English and after consulting the Oxford English dictionary) that the word \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo; expresses this third meaning. Could I now translate \u0026lsquo;Dharma\u0026rsquo; as \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo; or not? Or, are you demanding that I need to find a word in English that has all the ten meanings of Dharma that the Sanskrit dictionary gives to Dharma?\nLet us go one step further. Let us suppose that I do have a word in English that also has all these ten meanings, say, \u0026lsquo;pif-paf\u0026rsquo;. I use this word to translate \u0026lsquo;Dharma\u0026rsquo; and, I suppose, this translation is now exact and accurate. A decade later, someone discovers a series of manuscripts in Sanskrit and the upshot of this discovery is that Dharma now gets ten more additional meanings. What happens now? Does my translation suddenly become misleading and inaccurate? Or is the Sanskrit-Sanskrit dictionary itself wrong? Or what?\nIn other words, I do not see what you mean when you say \u0026ldquo;dharma\u0026rdquo; is not \u0026rsquo;equal\u0026rsquo; to \u0026ldquo;religion\u0026rdquo;. What exactly does your statement imply when it comes to translations?\nYou say: \u0026ldquo;The book that lends its title to this egroup suggests that really no one knew what they were talking about when they talked about religion, otherwise, why would they ascribe religion to all cultures? (and the \u0026ldquo;they\u0026rdquo; is mostly Europeans and Americans, is it not, with Indians following their lead?) So this is not a felicitous example.\u0026rdquo; I am afraid I have to disagree with you. I claim I know what religion is because I have a theory about religion. It is a very good example because that is what I am driving at: the problem is not one of translation, but one of theory. Our problems with the Wendy Donigers of this world do not reside in their \u0026lsquo;inaccurate\u0026rsquo; translation of Sanskrit words. We can only show that \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo; cannot translate \u0026lsquo;Dharma\u0026rsquo; not by looking up dictionaries and consulting our common-sense but by building a theory about both. We need a scientific theory not only about religion but also about Dharma. I do not see many candidates but apparently you do, if I go by your next paragraph.\nYou say: \u0026ldquo;Dharma is a technical term, defined and expounded upon in many Indic texts, and we don\u0026rsquo;t have to take anyone\u0026rsquo;s word for it, any more than we have to take anyone\u0026rsquo;s word for what \u0026ldquo;electron\u0026rdquo; means.\u0026rdquo; If this is indeed the case, the problem is easily settled. All you have to do is tell me the \u0026ldquo;technical\u0026rdquo; (i.e. the univocal and precise) meaning of the word \u0026ldquo;Dharma\u0026rdquo;. You are able to give a precise definition of \u0026ldquo;electron\u0026rdquo; and you accord the same status to the result of the labor embodied in the many Indic texts. In that case, you should be able to give that definition of Dharma. Once you do this (and I look forward to this), and show that Manu also accepted this definition of Dharma, I will write to Wendy Doniger myself to accuse her of (even) deliberately misleading her readers by translating \u0026lsquo;dharma\u0026rsquo; as \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo;. Do you think you can do that?\nYou say: \u0026ldquo;Yes, there are technical theories of dharma - more than one, that one will find in the Buddhist, Hindu, Jaina, etc., literature. If it ambiguous it is probably because it is overused\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Oh? What does this mean? Are there several theories of electron accordingly as we travel across the globe in the world of physics? Or is it the case that each of these tracts in these Indian traditions merely stipulates the meaning of the word? In that case, there is no theory of Dharma but merely a plethora of definitions in the Indian traditions. Such an exercise is totally uninteresting and trivial.\nComments English to Kannada dictionary — 2015-04-23 05:38:16\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s ever it is..I do not agree with the difference between Dharma And The religion (For the indian Subcontinent ).\n","tags":[],"title":"Translation or Theoretical Dispute: electron, dharma","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/translation-meaning-concepts-electron-dharma/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","colonial consciousness"],"content":" When we go-about with our fellow human beings, we need to possess some or another idea about the nature of ourselves and our fellow human beings. (Call it, for the sake of convenience, an \u0026lsquo;intuitive theory\u0026rsquo; about human beings.) It is an implicit understanding because each one of us does not have to be a professional philosopher or psychologist to get along with ourselves and fellow human beings. So, in principle, we must possess a vocabulary to talk about human beings; if we do not, we can neither talk about human beings nor could we make sense of their actions in the world.\nWe do seem to possess a vocabulary and the words in these vocabularies appear to have meanings that make sense to the users of the language. Yet, and this the absence I am talking about, we are unable to identify what these words refer to. The user of the word \u0026lsquo;manas\u0026rsquo; cannot identify which part of him is the \u0026lsquo;manas\u0026rsquo;; he wants to get rid of \u0026lsquo;manovikaara\u0026rsquo; in himself but he does not know whether that means he should not experience \u0026rsquo;emotions\u0026rsquo; (anger, sorrow, contentment\u0026hellip;) and, if this is what it means, how not to feel the emotions. Should he control his \u0026lsquo;manas\u0026rsquo; (how does he control what he does not know?), should he keep is \u0026lsquo;Chitta\u0026rsquo; untainted (\u0026lsquo;chittashuddhi\u0026rsquo;, but he does not know what his chitta is or where it is located except that it has something to do with himself)? How does he do either of the two? He knows he has to do \u0026lsquo;sankalpa\u0026rsquo; but he knows that no matter how often he tells himself (\u0026ldquo;is this not what \u0026lsquo;sankalpa\u0026rsquo; is?\u0026rdquo; he asks himself often) not to get angry, he continues to get angry. And so on.\nBeing unhappy in life, he wants to be happy. (He wants, if you know Tamil, \u0026lsquo;Nimmathi\u0026rsquo;.) He has been told that \u0026lsquo;ahamkaara\u0026rsquo; is one of the obstacles to finding what he wants to. He is puzzled: he knows that he is not \u0026lsquo;proud\u0026rsquo; of his accomplishments in life. So, does he continue to have \u0026lsquo;ahamkaara\u0026rsquo; or has he already got rid of it? If he still has it, what is it and how to get rid of it? He has no clue about any of these things because he really cannot make sense of the words he so fluently knows. Thus, the list can get built.\nMany of these things have been explained in the tracts of yesteryears, he has been told. So, he goes and tries to read them but he does not understand much. They talk about \u0026lsquo;sapta dhaatu\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;pancha vaayu\u0026rsquo;, and \u0026lsquo;pancha kosha\u0026rsquo; and so on, when they talk about human beings; they talk about horses, chariots and the charioteer, when they talk about \u0026lsquo;manas\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;buddhi\u0026rsquo; and so on. Neither the talk of \u0026lsquo;annamaya kosha\u0026rsquo; nor the talk of horses tells him much; his daily language says that humans have \u0026lsquo;kapibuddhi\u0026rsquo; (an apish buddhi that is inconstant) and he reads that \u0026lsquo;manas\u0026rsquo; is very fickle (\u0026lsquo;chanchala\u0026rsquo;) and flits from one subject to the other. So, is \u0026lsquo;manas\u0026rsquo; then what he used to call \u0026lsquo;Budhhi\u0026rsquo;? If he knows English even a little bit, he is now thoroughly confused: he had thought \u0026lsquo;buddhi\u0026rsquo; was \u0026lsquo;intelligence\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;manas\u0026rsquo; was \u0026lsquo;mind\u0026rsquo;. He tries to read some or another translation of a philosophical tract and cannot figure out what they are talking about because they invest terms with meanings he has difficulties in associating them with. They speak of \u0026lsquo;pramaana\u0026rsquo; in a way he does not understand (he thought \u0026lsquo;pramaana\u0026rsquo; was to take an oath); and speak of \u0026lsquo;anumaana\u0026rsquo; (which is what \u0026lsquo;doubt\u0026rsquo; is in his daily use) as though it settles issues!\nIn short, such tracts, instead of telling him something that illuminates, end up confusing him. They undercut his belief about his use of language so thoroughly that he just does not want to return to these tracts because he knows reading them is (almost) like learning another language. On top of it, he still has to figure out which his \u0026lsquo;annamaya kosha\u0026rsquo; is or what the \u0026lsquo;dhaatus\u0026rsquo; (he thought \u0026lsquo;dhaatu\u0026rsquo; had something to do with Sanskrit grammar) are!\nI consider this state of affairs very peculiar and want to draw attention to it by suggesting that this is an \u0026lsquo;absence\u0026rsquo;. My ideas and hypothesis about colonial consciousness is to take this occurrence out of the realm of the anecdotal and give it a place as a historical result.\nObjection: Only the enlightened know the meaning of \u0026lsquo;manas\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;buddhi\u0026rsquo; .It is not true to say that only those who have attained \u0026rsquo;nirvana\u0026rsquo; (and some exceptional people) know the meaning of \u0026lsquo;manas\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;buddhi\u0026rsquo; and such like. They are a part of our understanding of human psychology and if people do not have such an understanding, they cannot relate to either themselves or their fellow human beings. (If you cannot understand the actions of human beings \u0026ndash; from the most trivial to the more significant \u0026ndash; you cannot live amongst human beings. Such an understanding appeals to these concepts.) Thirdly, in order to understand its relative importance in the scheme of things, we first need to develop the hypothesis further. Only then could we specify (even then, approximately at best) what role the \u0026rsquo;loss of vocabulary\u0026rsquo; plays in the present Indian culture. Fourthly, it is not a mere loss of words that is at stake: it is about the accessibility or non-accessibility of our daily experience and our abilities to think about the same. For all these reasons, I consider it important to think deeply about the nature of colonial consciousness. (If you have not, perhaps, you should also read the other article of colonial consciousness that.)\nWhat intellectuals say percolates in a hundred different ways to the daily life of everyone, including those who are not intellectuals. Their insights are reformulated in several different ways and these help us in many more ways. Music, dance, poetry, cinema, harikatha, yakshagaana (in some areas of Karnataka)\u0026hellip; rework these insights in their own ways as well. However, this must be a continuous process because the world we are living in changes in so many different ways. Insights must be retold in the new idioms, new insights developed and new ways of reformulating them have to be discovered. I am not claiming that only a group of people called \u0026lsquo;intellectuals\u0026rsquo; (something like the pundits or university professors) do this: anyone who reflects on life is an \u0026lsquo;intellectual\u0026rsquo;\nColonialism affected this process drastically. Our insights are frozen at many different levels. (This does not mean that nobody in India understands these insights.) So, what should have been a continuous process of interaction has now frozen at multiple levels. In the process, a colonial consciousness has come into being.\nPerhaps it is true that, as you say, we do not talk much about emotions,. But that is not an explanation of why the concepts about human psychology do not make sense to us anymore. One has to look for an explanation of this state of affairs elsewhere. That is what I am trying to do.\nI get the impression that the expression about us \u0026ldquo;not having access to our experience\u0026rdquo; is creating a lot of confusion. Let us see if we can localize the confusion by seeing where it arises.\n11.1. The first time I formulate this idea is in my reply to Jeffrey Kripal which I published on Sulekha. In it, I spoke about a process of trivializing, transforming, distorting, denying and thus preventing access to our experience of the world. Do people have problems with the way I describe these processes? If yes, let us first discuss the issue at that level itself and not do more than that.\n11.2. The second time I take up this idea is in my article on \u0026ldquo;Intercultural dialogue\u0026rdquo;. I show how these processes engender violence. Are there any problems with either the examples or my discussion of the same?\n11.3. In my article on colonialism, I touch on this issue in a different way. I say now two extra things that are of relevance. One is that \u0026rsquo;education\u0026rsquo; also comes between us and our experience in some particular way but that it is not violence. While this sheds light on why people in the Metropolis saw colonialism as an educational project, I suggest that Colonialism (unlike educational process) foists a framework (not just this or that theory) in a violent way and that this framework denies us access to our experience. (Whenever I say something denies \u0026ldquo;access to experience\u0026rdquo;, I have all the five processes I speak about in my article with Kripal in mind.) Are there problems here?\n11.4. In \u0026ldquo;Some theses on Colonial Consciousness\u0026rdquo;, I bring all these ideas together as they are relevant to the creation of a consciousness in India over hundreds of years. And I add something more that is of relevance to this issue: I speak about Islamic colonialism (for the first time; until now I spoke either about \u0026lsquo;mogul rule\u0026rsquo; or of \u0026lsquo;Islamic invasion\u0026rsquo;) because it appears to me that one could also bring the above five processes by destroying access to descriptions and strategies using which one had hitherto accessed one\u0026rsquo;s experience of the world. Just as my notion of colonialism becomes sharper and broader, so too does my language: now, I am talking about the \u0026ldquo;experience of the world\u0026rdquo;.\nIf there are no problems with the previous three steps, and yet problems persist with this set of notes, then it could be because this broad use of \u0026rsquo;experience of the world\u0026rsquo; signals that my notion of experience is tracking my use of that word in my notes \u0026ldquo;On Ignorance\u0026rdquo; and in my article \u0026ldquo;How to speak for the Indian Traditions\u0026rdquo;.\n11.5. If this is the case, it shows the need for coining new words and giving them more precise meaning (i.e. coin a \u0026rsquo;technical term\u0026rsquo;). However, I am not convinced of that need yet partly because I am not sure what the relationship precisely is between my uses of the word \u0026rsquo;experience\u0026rsquo; in these different articles and notes. So, assuming no deep conflict in my uses, I shall try to state as simply as possible some ideas that might be of some help.\nI am not saying that we do not have any access to our experience of our world because of colonialism. I am saying that our access to experience is partially denied to us by colonialism. Which part is denied and which is not denied requires research before answering.\nI am not saying that before colonialism we were experiencing X as X but that we experience it as Y now. We do not know what we are experiencing in order to say whether we experience it as X or Y or Z. In and of itself, that we experience as Y what we experienced as X before is not a critique of colonialism. Thanks to the educational system set up by colonialism, we are now experiencing \u0026lsquo;gravitational force\u0026rsquo; (say), when we were experiencing the same thing as something else in the 5th century. That does not mean we should reject the theory of gravitation, does it?\nThe point is that we have no access to parts of our experience. So, we do not know what we are experiencing. Do we \u0026rsquo;experience\u0026rsquo; the \u0026lsquo;caste system\u0026rsquo; today? Do we experience \u0026lsquo;Hinduism as a religion\u0026rsquo; today? If no, what are we experiencing? If yes, what do we experience by these terms? These are the questions I raise.\nDid \u0026lsquo;Buddhism\u0026rsquo; contribute to the misunderstandings to the words we use? No, that question does not arise in the context of this set of notes. My question is not about some \u0026lsquo;original\u0026rsquo; meanings of the words, but what we understand by using them today. Without doubt, much of what \u0026lsquo;Buddhism\u0026rsquo; said also contributed to the development of the meaning of many of these words; undoubtedly, these contributions had their impact upon what was said subsequently. However, these are not issues that concern us.\nDoes not the very notion of relational self trivialize our experience of ourselves, because the relational self is what others say about us? The answer is actually a counter-question: which is the self whose experience is being trivialized? If \u0026lsquo;relational self\u0026rsquo; is all there is to our selves, there cannot be yet another \u0026lsquo;real self\u0026rsquo; whose experience is being trivialized. As I said in one of my recent posts, I speak of a number (five) of processes involved in denying access to our experience. They have a pattern and structure and the construction of self, as I speak about it in my 1985 paper, does not follow these steps.\nAbout Tamas, Rajas, and so on. At the moment, these gunas function more like names: \u0026lsquo;why does he get angry so easily?\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;Oh, that is because there is too much Tamoguna in him\u0026rsquo;. The answer does not explain anything. It is like the saying that Opium puts people to sleep because it has sleep inducing properties.\nYes, Ramana would exemplify the type of the person who accessed his experience. I have been told that the learned pundits came to him with interpretative questions about various Indian texts. This possibility of an illiterate man functioning as a guide to pundits strengthens my hypothesis about the nature of the Indian \u0026rsquo;texts\u0026rsquo;.\nII\nMany things, above all the configuration of learning, form the psychology of the Indians. Because what is lost is not the transmission of culture (but merely its adaptation in a particular manner to the surroundings that colonialism was), I am inclined to suggest that colonial consciousness is not a part of the cultural psychology of the Indians, even though it has an impact on our cultural psychology. Otherwise, one would be more inclined to say that a consciousness that is retained and transmitted in a culture for nearly a thousand years should be, properly speaking, considered a part of the cultural psychology of the people in question.\nHowever, what is lost is not merely some theory or another but one which helps us make sense of our experience. It is a reflection on experience and something that forms our experience. It is a \u0026rsquo;theory\u0026rsquo; in a peculiar sense of the term: it is a description of the world (that is why it has the form of a theory) but one which subordinates this role to one of guiding us in our endeavors in the world. If a heuristic (or action rule) has to be comprehensible (and become less complex than it otherwise would be), some or another descriptive element has to play an important role.\nConsequently, what we have lost (in losing the transmission of these theories as a part of our experience of the world) is (a) not merely the meaning or the sense of these words but also (b) an ability to use them the way they have to be used if they have to succeed in making sense of our experience. The transmission of these abilities is a part of the transmission of these theories. That is why, reading the Gita (or any text) is of little use on its own: the Guru, I think, is indispensable to the transmission process; because he would tell us how to read these texts as instructions for action. The problem of the colonial consciousness is to be partly located here: we have the theories (the books of Shankara, Abhinavagupta,\u0026hellip;etc are available to us, but this availability does not seem to help us much) but we have difficulties in doing much with them unless it is to write \u0026rsquo;learned\u0026rsquo; tracts. It is important to notice that I am not merely saying that some or another \u0026rsquo;textual interpretative tradition\u0026rsquo; is lost in transmission. If that was all there is to it, the existing set of Sanskrit pundits could solve the problem.\nIn fact, what I am saying is that the existence of Sanskrit pundits is an index of the nature of the problem of colonial consciousness. They have transformed the problem of understanding Indian texts into a \u0026lsquo;hermeneutic problem\u0026rsquo; as well: the process and procedure of \u0026lsquo;recovering\u0026rsquo; the meaning of the texts. So, what I am saying is that the how of going about with these texts was a part of the culture that produced these texts that made sense of our experience and transformed the latter. This is what we lost in losing the centers of intellectual activity as well.\nHowever, so long as the culture gets transmitted, we will have to sooner or later confront the questions that our culture threw up: to make sense of experience. Why?\nIf I were to sum up the nature of the Indian (or Asian) culture in one sentence (as it relates to the goal or purpose of human life), here is how I would do it: \u0026ldquo;Given that we are born, how can we be happy?\u0026rdquo; Our traditions assure us that every human being can be happy and that the happiness of one is not antagonistic to the happiness of the other. There are no qualifications to be happy: one could be rich or poor; stupid or intelligent; literate or illiterate; man or woman; There are no requirements except that one tries to be happy. This attitude is so deeply ingrained in us that we hardly notice that it is our basic \u0026lsquo;goal\u0026rsquo; in life. This venture to be happy (have ananda) forces us to reflect on experience. That is why our traditions keep on throwing up Gurus (even if they take the form of contemporary swamijis) and we keep on searching. For historical reasons, this quest has also become the quest of generations to recover their traditions. People like us are present all over India; they are searching the way we are searching too. One day, all our paths will meet.\nIn \u0026lsquo;Some theses on Colonial Consciousness\u0026rsquo; I am signaling an absence. If it is the case that there is such an absence, it is a very disturbing absence.\n","tags":[],"title":"Sanskrit Pundits, Indian texts, Colonial Consciousness","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/sanskrit-pundits-indian-texts-colonial-consciousness/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","criticism","religion"],"content":"Balagangadhara points out an inconsistent reasoning of the western and westernized Scholars, as well as the last 400 years of humanities scholarship.\n\u0026ldquo;Let me summarise the dilemma. Some properties are necessary for some traditions (Judaism, Christianity, Islam) to be religions. If one accepts this, the threat is that other cultures appear not to have religions at all. For some reason or another (I discuss the reasons in chapters 3 through 7), other cultures are said to have religions too. However, the conditions under which other cultures are to have religion are precisely those that make it impossible for the Semitic religions to be religions. That is to say, if the Semitic religions are what religions are, other cultures do not have religions. If other cultures have religions, then the Semitic religions are not religions. The inconsistency lies in insisting that both statements are true.\u0026rdquo;\nTo rebut the above, many scholars have appealed to Wittgenstein\u0026rsquo;s language game: the word \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo; is like a game. Can we find a constituent property of games: what makes baseball, football, cricket, tennis, etc, a game? No satisfactory answer can be given to this question. In the same way, demanding an answer to \u0026ldquo;what makes some phenomenon religion\u0026rdquo; makes the question junk. Is it really a junk question?\n\u0026ldquo;One could appeal to our linguistic practices, inspired by the pronouncements of Wittgenstein. A term like \u0026lsquo;religion,\u0026rsquo; one might wish to say, is akin to a term like \u0026lsquo;game.\u0026rsquo; We do not know what is common to games like chess, football, solitaire and the Olympics (except that there is \u0026lsquo;family resemblance\u0026rsquo;), but our linguistic community teaches us the use of such and similar words. The inconsistency arises because we have assumed that all religions share some properties. If we give up this assumption, but instead \u0026rsquo;look\u0026rsquo; at all these diverse religions, we see that they do not have common properties but share, instead, a family resemblance. Therefore, the alleged inconsistency vanishes. Would this answer help us?\nPerhaps it could, if it were an answer. However, it is not; it merely unravels a nest of problems. Linguistic practices of our communities, which teach us the use of words, have a cultural history. This history is the history of a community that has learnt to speak this way and not that way. For the West, this cultural history happens to be the history of Christianity. Therefore, our question becomes this: why are the people influenced by this cultural history convinced that other cultures have religion too? To say that this is a \u0026ldquo;language game\u0026rdquo; and, consequently, to say this \u0026lsquo;why?\u0026rsquo; question is inappropriate, is to miss a crucial point: religio comes from Latin, used by the Romans first, but appropriated later by Christianity. This point raises two historical questions: what was the nature of the Roman religio? How was this \u0026rsquo;language game\u0026rsquo; appropriated (and modified) by Christians and others?\u0026rdquo;\nBalagangadhara\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;The heathen in his blindess: Asia, the West and the dynamic of religion.\u0026rdquo; demonstrates that Wittgenstein\u0026rsquo;s answer wouldn\u0026rsquo;t help. In fact, studying the western culture answers the question: why the West has been compelled to see religions everywhere?\n","tags":[],"title":"Family resemblances, language games, Wittgenstein, and debates on religion","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/family-resemblances-language-games-wittgenstein-and-debates-on-religion/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","colonial consciousness","colonialism"],"content":"Colonialism has been one of the most significant phenomena in the history of humankind in the last three hundred years or so. Its importance can hardly be overstated. Yet, as many have said before, it has not been adequately theorized. There is of course a great deal of material on the histories, the effects, and the political resistances to colonialism. Reading them, however, merely increases the puzzlement about colonialism: though it seems to be at the root of all the ills of the modern world, what is not clear is how or why that is the case. Perhaps, that has to do with an implicit consensus shared by many: everyone appears to know what it is and most agree about its immoral nature. Colonialism emerges as a self-clarifying and a self-explaining phenomenon. If it is self-luminescent and so manifest an evil, why did many people in the Metropolis argue both about the nature of the phenomenon and its moral status for centuries on end?\nThis question becomes even more complex, if we look at the participants in this debate. Liberal theorists like John Locke, John Stuart Mill, and revolutionaries like Karl Marx found colonialism a positive event in world history; among those who opposed it, there were conservative political thinkers like Edmund Burke. Today, however, there is a reconfiguration of this constellation: liberals, leftists and radicals are unanimous in condemning colonialism; those who dare speak about its \u0026lsquo;positive\u0026rsquo; aspects are the conservatives and those from the extreme right. One cannot explain this state of affairs by drawing attention to the shifting nature of political labels like the \u0026rsquo;left\u0026rsquo; and the \u0026lsquo;right\u0026rsquo;. If a political theory that criticizes Fascism does a volte-face a century later to celebrate it as a \u0026rsquo;liberation movement\u0026rsquo;, such a situation does not say much about the shifting nature of political labels as it throws doubt on our understanding of Fascism.\nConsequently, on what grounds can one determine whether the ethical and political stance one assumes with respect to colonialism is adequate? We believe that both the refusal of the Marxist theories to assume an ethical position and the nature of moral criticisms that exist today are symptomatic of our lack of clarity about the nature of the phenomenon. Often, criticisms of a colonizer\u0026rsquo;s specific action replace an ethical criticism of colonialism. Ethical objections to the role of either the British Crown or the activities of the British East India Company do not allow for an automatic extension. That is, such arguments are not criticisms of the project of colonialism in general or of the colonization of India, unless one can show what is unethical about the project itself. What is unethical about a project that, among other things, industrialized the colonies, established courts of Law, laid railroads, and introduced scientific education, modern medicine and parliamentary democracy there? As long as we do not address this issue properly, there are no obvious reasons to assume that the earlier generations of thinkers were wrong. Today, it is not clear how or why colonialism is an evil or from where it draws its evil strength. In other words, we lack an adequate understanding of colonialism. At least, that is partly what we want to suggest in this paper.\nHow does one show that something (in our case, substantial knowledge about colonialism) is absent? Based on what we know about colonialism, if we could reasonably expect the absence of a phenomenon and yet notice evidence for its presence, we would be justified in claiming that we do not know much about colonialism. We believe we do have such a candidate: colonial consciousness.\nColonialism generated a particular way of looking at the world in both the Metropolis and the colonies. For now, using the word \u0026lsquo;colonial consciousness\u0026rsquo; to indicate this particular way of looking at the world, we would like to raise the following issue. If colonialism were to belong to the past, then we would expect colonial consciousness to be absent from the descriptions of the modern day world. If we find indications of its presence, clearly, we need to rethink the claim that colonialism is a phenomenon in the past.\nFrom Balagangadhara, S.N.; Bloch, Esther, De Roover, Jakob (2008), \u0026ldquo;Rethinking Colonialism and Colonial Consciousness: The Case of Modern India.\u0026rdquo; in S.

In this formulation, it is as though the logical form of religion is able to spread itself by disposing of its semantic content. Thus, both the common sense of the West and the scholarly consensus of the academia accept the background assumptions of Christian doctrine, while they do not adopt its specific teachings. Balu has always been somewhat unhappy about this formulation. As he argues in chapter 11 of `The Heathen in his blindness: Asia, the West and the dynamic of religion\u0026rsquo;, it is not a specific set of assumptions which spreads in society, but rather certain attitudes. The claims about the universality of religion, the meaning of life, the necessity of norms, the superiority of liberal democracy, etc. do not generally appear as explicit premises held by a group of people. Then, it seems the only explanation one can give is to ascribe them to these people as implicit assumptions. To some extent, this works: theories about the origin of religion, or the nature of morality, or human psychology all presuppose that certain assumptions are true. So if one intends to reveal the conceptual problems of these theories, it is fruitful to analyze these assumptions as the hidden premises of theorizing. However, when it comes to explaining how the Christian religion spreads in a secular form, these accounts are unconvincing. What happens? Do the implicit assumptions or formalized theological schemes expand their scope as a kind of unit ideas by jumping from mind to mind? In what realm do these assumptions and background frameworks exist and procreate? The problem becomes acute when we turn to the spread of secularized Christianity in pagan societies like the Indian. Do the elite of alienated intellectuals suddenly adopt these assumptions as the starting points of reasoning about politics and society? Do they spread automatically from the colonized elite to other layers of Indian society, because this is a basic dynamic of societies? Such answers would be unsatisfactory. But what then is the mechanism through which secularized religious schemes spread and structure the experience of an ever increasing number of individuals? This and other related questions have been bothering me for some time (not least because I have failed to solve any of them in my doctoral thesis).\nAs said, Balu has always stressed that secularized religion spreads in the form of certain attitudes towards life, society and the world: one begins to look at human lives, actions and historical events as carriers of meaning, intention or purpose; one views practices as the embodiments of beliefs or doctrines; one conceives of all cultural ethics as bodies of norms; one approaches society as a system constituted by a legal framework; one experiences natural phenomena as linked to each other by an underlying order, whose regularities should be disclosed. This formulation in terms of attitudes is promising as a step towards an explanation of secularization. Certainly, it is more promising than the account in terms of implicit assumptions and secularized religious schemes, which expand by casting off doctrinal constraints. But how do these attitudes or stances spread in society? Our recent research and reflections, I think, bring us to a very simple answer: the rule of law is the mechanism of secularization. Let me draw together some insights of Balu and others in order to defend this tentative hypothesis.\nLaw is the means through which traditions are reformed according to certain theological principles. If you look at law, including its institutional embodiments such as the state, courts and other legal institutions, it has done a number of things both in the western societies and in a colonized society like the Indian. At a first obvious level, it has reformed the traditional practices of early modern Europe and modern India. In Europe, this happened during the seventeenth century, through the imposition of a vast body of ecclesiastic laws in the confessional churches (both Catholic, Calvinist and Lutheran). A variety of traditional practices were discarded as idolatry and immorality and replaced by legal procedures that embodied Christian norms (many illustrations can be found in chapter 4.2 of my doctoral thesis). In colonial India, a very similar development took place. All kinds of puja practices, which were considered as idolatrous and immoral were abolished through the famous Abolition Acts. This goes from hook-swinging through bird sacrifices to the devadasi tradition and polygamy. The norms that replaced these practices were not explicitly Christian. They merely spread an attitude of repulsion and indignation towards the idolatry', cruelty\u0026rsquo;, oppression' and irrationality\u0026rsquo; of the traditional Hindu practices. Thus, law spread the Christian stance towards idolatry in a secularized form.\nLaw is the means through which societies are reformed according to certain normative models. Again, this is quite obvious. The legal system both in Enlightenment Europe and in colonial India forced all traditions to accept the normative framework of liberty, equality and fraternity as the superior model of society. These Protestant values were imposed by law as though they embodied secular reason. In European nation-states, for instance, the legal systems began to compel `citizens\u0026rsquo; to pledge loyalty to the national sovereign alone in the temporal realm of our earthly lives. Catholic believers could no longer submit themselves to the papacy as a temporal authority, but only as a spiritual authority related to the heavenly realm and the salvation of the soul. This was enforced as the sublimely rational model of a nation-state which treats all citizens as equals irrespective of their creeds. In reality, secular law compelled the European Catholics to accept the Protestant notion of religion as an individual relationship with God over which no human being could have authority in this world.\nIn India, the Temple Entry Acts provide a good example. These masqueraded as a struggle of reason, equality and morality against the horribly inegalitarian tyranny of caste (apparently, the British and colonized lawyers had forgotten that European societies were dominated by `clubs\u0026rsquo; with restricted entry). In reality, these Temple Entry Acts imposed the Protestant model of religion as a relationship with God in which all souls ought to be free and equal as though it was the one true morality. Again, the secularized Christian attitudes towards morality and equality were imposed and diffused by the legal system in India.\nLaw forces people to defend their cultural traditions as religious doctrines and thus reforms tradition into religion. This is where law as the mechanism of secularization becomes truly fascinating. Colonial law in India embodied the normative model of toleration and religious liberty. At first glance, this may seem to be good, since it implied that the traditional practices of the Hindoos' were to be tolerated. This impression is wrong, however. In fact, the legal model of toleration compelled the Hindus to make their traditions into religions. This policy systematically forced Hindus to prove that a particular practice was founded in the true religious doctrines of Hinduism\u0026rsquo;. This happened, because the liberal colonial state would only tolerate a practice if the proper religious authority' had demonstrated that the practice really belonged to the realm of religion. Thus, in the nineteenth-century controversy over the practice of widow-burning, the Governor-General in Council decided in 1805 that \u0026quot;the best course to follow, according to fundamental principle of religious toleration, would be to allow the practice in those cases in which it was countenanced by their religion, while preventing it in others in which it was by the same authority prohibited.\u0026quot; In the same controversy, a colonial observer commented that \u0026quot;the true interpretation of the religious law/will no doubt diminish, if not extinguish the desire for self-immolation. The safest way of coming to a right understanding on a point so interesting to humanity, is a rigid investigation of the rules of conduct laid down in the books which are considered sacred by the Hindoos.\u0026quot; Consequently, the orthodox Hindu community began to aggressively defend the practice of self-immolation by demonstrating its foundation in the religious doctrines\u0026rsquo; and sacred texts' of the Hindu religion'. Following this route, the colonial legal policy of religious toleration gradually transformed the self-confidence and vibrancy of the Hindu traditions into a fanatical defense of their alleged religious doctrines'. Before the early nineteenth century, the Hindu spokesmen had protected their traditions from the missionary onslaught by pointing out the antiquity of their ancestral practices. Or they insisted that \u0026quot;every one may be saved by his own Religion, if he does what is Good, and shuns Evil,\u0026quot; as a Malabar Brahmin told the missionary Ziegenbalg in the early eighteenth century. This changed once the liberal colonial state implemented its policy of religious toleration: now these traditions had to prove that they were proper religions in order to be legitimate. In the same way as its colonial precursor, the secular state of post-independence India has forced the Hindu traditions to identify and stand up for themselves as religious doctrines, variants of Islam and Christianity. The result is the Hindutva movement: a rabid attempt to establish the doctrines of Hinduism\u0026rsquo; as the superior and dominant form of religion in the Indian society. Hindutva imitates all the strategies of religious self-assertion, which Muslims and Christians have developed so as to exploit law for their own purposes. For instance, ever more cases occur in India of Hindu organizations going to court, because \u0026ldquo;their religious sentiments and sensitivities have been violated.\u0026rdquo;\nAgain, law spreads a typical Christian attitude in a secularized form: it forces one to defend one\u0026rsquo;s tradition as a religion, with its own sacred doctrines and sacrosanct sentiments. Turning to the West, this has taken tragic forms today. A week back there was an account in the newspaper about a controversy in the UK. Apparently, a `Hindu organization\u0026rsquo; calling itself the \u0026ldquo;Hindu Forum\u0026rdquo; had objected when the British postal services issued a stamp depicting a painting of an Indian-looking pair wearing tilaks, who are doing puja for the Infant Jesus. The spokesmen of this organization found it unacceptable that \u0026ldquo;Hindus were depicted as worshipping Christ.\u0026rdquo; This shows how a pluralist tradition is being reformed into an intolerant religion, because the British legal system will only respect a cultural community if it is able to invoke its sacred doctrines and sacrosanct sentiments. The U.S. legal system also promotes such religious self-assertion and such demands for the recognition of a separate identity. Basically, its model of toleration forces ethnic and other communities to take the form of secularized Protestant churches, with a set of doctrines and norms that should never be violated. Many Hindu organizations and individuals like Rajiv Malhotra are unwittingly participating in the workings of this legal mechanism of secularization. The way in which they intend to defend and promote the Hindu traditions in the West mould these traditions into variants of Christian churches. In this context, the spread of secularized Christian attitudes through the legal system takes an extremely insidious form.\nLaw compels people to recount their actions as though these form an intentional pattern that embodies some purpose, reason or aim. This is another insidious facet of law as the mechanism of secularization. In judicial cases, one has to present a series of actions and events as though they were intentional: \u0026ldquo;Person x committed action a, because he wanted to ruin my reputation. And person y joined x and she committed b in order to further hamper the development of my career. Then, I reacted and in order to protect myself I threatened y and told her to convey to x that I would get him if he didn\u0026rsquo;t back off.\u0026rdquo; These kinds of intentional accounts do not represent what actually happened. They usually link a series of disparate events and actions in order to reveal a supposed plan or pattern of reasons. Strikingly, whenever one goes to court, one is compelled to present one\u0026rsquo;s case in the form of such an account. Thus, the legal system forces one to adopt the religious attitude towards actions and events as the embodiments of reasons and purposes. A close friend of mine here at Kuvempu University is involved in a judicial process and he gave an excellent account of what happens in law. He told me that first his lawyers told him to give an account which related a series of unrelated events to each other as though the persons involved had done everything deliberately. Basically, he says, \u0026ldquo;my lawyers forced me to tell untruths, because otherwise we would certainly lose the case.\u0026rdquo; Then, in court, he was first asked by the judge to put his hand on the Gita and solemnly swear that he would tell \u0026ldquo;the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.\u0026rdquo; He was completely disgusted by this charade. What it illustrates is how the rule of law compels Indians to adopt Christian attitudes towards actions, texts and truth.\n*Law compels people to found their practical decisions and actions in terms of good scientific' reasons*. This is clear in the many cases all of us have seen on TV or in the newspapers. On the one hand, all decisions in a legal case are supposed to be founded in scientific truth\u0026rsquo; (that is, the hypotheses which are dominant at that particular point of time). Thus, science as the search for Truth becomes the ultimate adjudicator of practical decisions in a society. On the other hand, when a particular practice is challenged in courts, one has to give good scientific reasons' in order to defend the practice. In Europe, one only needs to think of the many cases of Muslims being brought to court for their custom to butcher animals at home on certain holy days. Or one can imagine a case where a modern Hindu has to defend the wearing of a kumkum at work in terms of scientific reasons: it stimulates health because it is located on one of the basic nerve points, etc. So, again law spreads a religious attitude towards the world, which strives to found all human practices in good scientific reasons'.\nLaw\u0026rsquo;s principles of proof of guilt reproduce Christian notions of morality. Recently, Balu and I read an article by the philosopher of science Larry Laudan who has now turned his research to the epistemology of law. The article in question, \u0026ldquo;How Reasonable is `Proof Beyond a Reasonable Doubt\u0026rsquo;?\u0026rdquo; (published in the journal Legal Theory), Larry Laudan\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;How Reasonable is \u0026lsquo;Proof Beyond a Reasonable Doubt\u0026rsquo;?\u0026rdquo; (published in the journal Legal Theory), shows how the principle of proof beyond a reasonable doubt is utterly unreasonable when one analyzes it in terms of epistemological standards. Laudan\u0026rsquo;s argument is convincing. The problem is it makes all these judges and lawyers look like fools. Balu was not satisfied by Laudan\u0026rsquo;s pragmatic justification of proof beyond a reasonable dount (of 10 accused, the principle will lead to 9 being legitimately convicted and 1 innocent fellow going to the gallows). Interestingly, the advocacy of this legal principle often invokes a notion of \u0026lsquo;moral certainty\u0026rsquo;. It is as though when a group of 12 (?) jury members and a judge unanimously come to the decision that there is proof beyond a reasonable doubt, then the individual at the other end must be guilty of whatever he or she is accused of. Now, this attitude, Balu suggests, reflects the notion of conscience in the Christian religion. According to the theology of conscience, God has inscribed His Law for humanity in all human creatures. A few definitions can show what conscience means to Christians: \u0026ldquo;The conscience of man…Is a man\u0026rsquo;s judgement of himselfe, according to the judgement of God of him.\u0026rdquo; Or: \u0026ldquo;Conscience is that Power, or Faculty of the Mind, which judges of our Actions according to a right Rule, whether they be agreeable to it or not.\u0026rdquo; This rule is God\u0026rsquo;s Will. Conscience is called \u0026ldquo;that universal Monarch, whose Ubiquitary Throne is establish\u0026rsquo;d in every mortal Breast.\u0026rdquo; A Quaker writes that conscience is \u0026ldquo;an Ability in the Understanding of man, by a reflective act to judge of himself in all he does, as to his acceptance or rejection with God\u0026rdquo; and he adds that \u0026ldquo;this is the inward Rule he hath to walk by.\u0026rdquo; Before the fall, Adam had been perfectly good and even after the fall, humankind retained the knowledge of the perfectly good in contrast with evil. This perfect knowledge allowed man to distinguish \u0026ldquo;between Good and Evil,\u0026rdquo; and worked as \u0026ldquo;a constant witness to God in his soul, and by secret reference to what he was at firrst, tells him what he still ought to be.\u0026rdquo; The left-over of God\u0026rsquo;s Will in us after the Fall is what we still call conscience. In other words, conscience tells us how we ought to act according to God\u0026rsquo;s Will and judges every act of ours in relation to this norm. Given the belief that each individual conscience still reflects the Will of God to some extent (unless it is completely corrupted, but this the selection of jury members is supposed to prevent), the origin of the notions of moral certainty and proof beyond a reasonable doubt becomes clear. When so many good Christians agree on the guilt of the accused, it must be God\u0026rsquo;s Will speaking through their consciences. It is sickening to see how law\u0026rsquo;s reproduction of secularized Christian attitudes towards morality leads to the upholding of a silly principle in the American courts (and to the conviction of innocents).\nTo conclude a post that has become far too long: there is prima facie evidence for the hypothesis that the rule of law is the mechanism of secularization of the Christian religion. Naturally, this raises more complex questions: How has law compelled both Europeans and Indians to adopt secularized Christian attitudes? It seems the legal system made the adoption of these attitudes into a precondition of survival for individuals and traditions. Since law had the monopoly to settle conflicts, the people involved had two choices: either you accept the legal system\u0026rsquo;s approach to actions, events, practices and then you embrace secularized religion; or you lose. Why did the mechanism of secularization in Christianity take the form of law? How come post-independence India continues the legal system of the colonial state and therefore further spreads religious attitudes in its society? Etc.\n","tags":[],"title":"Christian Attitudes and The Rule of Law as the Mechanism of Secularization ","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/law-secularization-and-religious-attitudes/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","colonial consciousness"],"content":" As Indians, if we have to access the Indian traditions we need two things: (a) it must be possible for us to access them; (b) we must know how to access them. That is to say, growing up in the Indian traditions not merely means that we have the possibility of accessing them if we want to but we have also learnt how to access them when we want to. Only for the sake of convenience, let me put it this way: in so far as we are brought up in the Indian culture, in ideal conditions, we learn two things: (a) we learn to access our experience (one kind of ability); (b) we also learn to access the Indian traditions that are the results of accesses that the earlier generations have had to their experience (a second kind of ability). If we get only the ability (a) transmitted to us, it is like reinventing the wheel but a through a cumbersome process: trial and error, stumbling and standing upright, going through dead ends and false avenues and so on. Some might succeed in this venture, yet others might fail. There are no signposts, no heuristics, and no established results to work with etc.\nIn ideal conditions, we also learn \u0026ldquo;the Indian way\u0026rdquo; of accessing (a). That is, (b) is also transmitted to us.\nIn the worst case scenario, the Indian culture disintegrates. That is neither the ability (a) nor the ability (b) is transmitted. In the ideal case, both are transmitted. What about situations (1) where (a) is transmitted and (b) is not? In this case, (2) what if instead of the \u0026ldquo;Indian way\u0026rdquo; some other way, say the \u0026ldquo;western way\u0026rdquo; starts making up for its absence? Colonial consciousness, as I see it, is about both the situation (1) and situation (2)\nWe learn to access our experience because our culture has not disintegrated. But we have not learnt how to access this experience in \u0026ldquo;the Indian way\u0026rdquo;. Of course, it is the case that the transmission our culture which teaches us to access our experience will also help us reinvent the \u0026ldquo;Indian way\u0026rdquo; (if the need arises) all over again. In a way, we are doing this now: in the process of reinventing \u0026ldquo;the Indian way\u0026rdquo; of accessing experience, we discover that we can regain access (in some fashion) to the accumulated \u0026ldquo;Indian way\u0026rdquo; as well. But because we are reinventing, our relationship to the past will be in terms of how the reinvention today is taking place: through the language of the present, and driven by our exigencies.\nIf you disagree with this, then your difficulty is with the issue itself: you probably think that (b) is also transmitted (through stories, rituals, etc) without taking into consideration that we treat these stories and rituals the way the West treats them.\n","tags":[],"title":"Religious colonialism: Islamic vs. Christian","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/religious-colonialism-islamic-vs-christian/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","colonial consciousness","Buddha"],"content":"\u0026ldquo;How do we understand the idea that an enlightened person has no wants?\u0026rdquo; Before we understand what the idea says, it would be good to find out what it does not say. Understanding this would also allow us to appreciate the depth and extent of colonial consciousness.\nIf you look at the way the Buddha was portrayed in the middle-class text books you studied (that is also how he was more or less portrayed during my period), it appears as though he gave up or renounce all his desires. In other words, he became an \u0026lsquo;ascetic\u0026rsquo; man. Yet strangely enough, if we read about the Buddha\u0026rsquo;s road to enlightenment, we find something else: he did take to and practice asceticism, but, he says, it did not help him to get enlightened! That is, even though some people do practice asceticism and can get enlightened (after all, every path can lead to enlightenment), this was not the Buddha\u0026rsquo;s way. The Buddha, then, did not become enlightened by \u0026lsquo;giving up\u0026rsquo; his desires. Almost in a similar vein, Purandara Dasa also says in his \u0026ldquo;Eenu Maadidareenu Bhava Hingadu\u0026rdquo; that \u0026ldquo;punishing his body\u0026rdquo; did not help him.\nSo, while it is indeed true that the Buddha said that \u0026ldquo;desire is the reason or the root of sorrow\u0026rdquo;, he did not say that one should therefore renounce or give up desires. This \u0026lsquo;popular\u0026rsquo; interpretation of \u0026lsquo;Buddhism\u0026rsquo; has to do with who popularized Buddhism in India in the last centuries, namely, the British. Two things are integral components of Christianity (in both Protestant and Catholic versions): a deep suspicion of bodily cravings and desires and a concomitant asceticism. The first attitude exists because it is the work of the Devil to incite a human being into desiring and also because having the body is an expression of the punishment of being thrown out of Paradise. The second is praiseworthy because \u0026lsquo;purity\u0026rsquo; lies in renouncing these cravings. When the British interpreted Buddhist \u0026rsquo;teachings\u0026rsquo;, they did do through these prisms and we have repeated their interpretations ever since.\nIf we realize that relating sorrow to desire is not merely Buddhist but also Upanishadic, we face a strange problem. When human beings want to be happy (or strive to find happiness), they want to find happiness in their daily life. Consequently, a call to \u0026lsquo;give up their daily lives\u0026rsquo; and practice asceticism cannot be an answer to their query. They are not seeking some abstract good called \u0026lsquo;happiness\u0026rsquo; but they want to be happy in their lives. Consequently, only those who teach them how to be happy in their ordinary, day-to-day life have any chance of being heard by them. Such teachers could hardly say \u0026lsquo;give up desires\u0026rsquo; and still hope to be heard by the majority.

That is to say, the configuration of learning determines how they learn whatever it is they learn.\nWhat do they learn from the West? That theoretical knowledge is the foundation of all human going-about. That is, that their activities have to be theoretically founded.\nHowever, in the Indian way of going-about, the practical or the performative dominates.\nConsequently, they adopt certain ways of talking about their goings-about. This adoption is itself determined by their configuration of learning. This means that the way they understand and interpret, say, the adopted western theories about man and society will be different from the western way. This suggests that they talk as though certain conceptions (or certain theories) found human actions. (E.g. the way make the western criticisms of the caste system, or their enthusiastic defense of secularism, or their alleged feminism and Marxism, etc.)\nIn which way is their understanding of the western theories different from the westerners themselves? It will involve some kind of distortion. The westerners use terms and concepts to refer to objects in their experiential world. Indians use the same words with the same or better fluency without, however, being able to fix the objects these concepts refer to. (E.g. \u0026lsquo;worship\u0026rsquo;, the moral \u0026lsquo;ought\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;God\u0026rsquo;, the \u0026lsquo;hierarchical caste system\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;civil society\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;citizen\u0026rsquo; etc.) These objects do not exist in the Indian experiential world. Consequently, these concepts and the theories that embed them become mantras. They function as syntactical strings that one has learnt to put together. However, the theories that embed them lose their reference to experiential world. (This raises many problems about \u0026lsquo;meaning\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;reference\u0026rsquo;.)\nThis mantric repetition (together with the learnt ability to put the syntactic strings together) generates the conviction that one understands these theories the way the western intellectuals do. This conviction is part of the \u0026lsquo;colonial consciousness\u0026rsquo; of the Indian intellectuals. They believe that the description of the western experience is a description of their world.\nBecause the way they talk about their world is a mantric repetition, their reflections on their experiential world is either retarded or totally arrested. Somehow (the \u0026lsquo;how\u0026rsquo; is not clear) an identification is made between talking the way the western intellectuals do on the one hand and the reflections on the social world by the Indian intellectuals on the other. This is one of the effects of colonialism. Western talk appears to substitute for Indian cultural experience.\nAmong other things, colonialism tried to alter the configuration of learning. Even though it did not succeed in doing this, it did alter the then existing coordination between different learning processes. Therefore, a new equilibrium between these learning processes will be found, if the Indian culture survives. I suggest that the last fifty years or more has consisted of attempts to find that equilibrium. I do not believe that it has yet been found.\nConsequently, we have the presence of many different things in India. The transmission of culture continues (i.e. one learns through the Indian configuration of learning); the lack of connection between a way of talking about the world and the experience of the world continues; the different experiments to \u0026lsquo;restore\u0026rsquo; (if I may put it this way) the coordination of the learning processes continue, and so on.\nThe Indian way of westernization is an expression of all these different processes. Their way of making western constructs their own is a combination of at least (a) colonial consciousness, (b) the Indian configuration of learning and (c) the event that colonialism is. I know that this is not as clear as one would have hoped. Lack of clarity has to do with: (a) the fact that my story is not yet developed enough to answer such concrete questions; (b) the need to do research into the nature of colonialism; (c) the fact that we need to do research into the concrete, empirical aspects of the question itself and (d) with the fact that these issues do not lend themselves to abstract answers.\nCheck p.62 of \u0026ldquo;We shall not cease \u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n","tags":[],"title":"Indian way of Westernization","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/indian-way-of-westernization/"},{"categories":["adhoc","Balagangadhara","explanatorily intelligible"],"content":"The first question: could we have EIA of units smaller than the Cosmos?\nAn explanatorily intelligible account of any object, whatever that object is, is one where causal (say) and intentional explanations fall together. The causal account provides, let us say, an explanation that makes it clear what the causal antecedents of some object (or event, or phenomenon) are. (For the sake of this discussion, let us assume that theories in Natural Sciences provide us with explanations and that they are causal in nature.) The only kind of explanation we know that provides `meaning\u0026rsquo; (or reasons) for objects (or events, or phenomenon) are intentional ones: they postulate an agent; actions, objects and phenomena are seen to embody the intentions (beliefs, hopes, desires, designs, projects, etc.) of the agent. Such an explanation is an intentional explanation.\nSo, the first issue is: do we have a species of explanation, which fuses causal and intentional explanations together? Yes, and that is religion. We have no other examples.\nThe second question: could we have such an explanation in the future (of, say, human actions), which is not religion? Yes, logically speaking, we could; but not within the cosmos we live in and not for the kind of beings we are. Why? Because, as human beings, everything we do is subject to regularities that are outside and beyond ourselves (in the first place). In the second place, the reasons we adduce in order to do something might not be the cause of that action. (You might marry someone because you say you love that person; it is not clear how a genetic, physiological, sociological and psychological explanation might transform your intentional explanation.) In other words, the domain of intentional explanation shrinks as the scientific descriptions of the world multiply. (This is one of the insights that support reductionist arguments in the human sciences'.) Thirdly, it is not clear what intentions\u0026rsquo; are (anymore than what `causes\u0026rsquo; are): are they themselves expressions of other causes or something free of any causal influence? In other words, it is totally unclear what it means to ask for an explanation (that is not religion), which fuses causes and intentions together.\nThe reference to `meaning\u0026rsquo; alone does not make an account into an explanatorily intelligible one. Consider the issue of the toaster: the human ingenuity makes use of the (causal) properties of objects and phenomena to build a toaster. The toaster has a function; it is man-made; it embodies a design; it is built for a purpose. These general ascriptions are true of all human products. This tells us that one could provide a general intentional account (which is very weak because of its generality) of man-made objects. But this intentional account does not help in the production of the toaster. For the toaster to come into being some or another causal account is required that makes no appeal to the intentions of the human beings but instead to the properties of objects and phenomena. Consequently, we have two distinct accounts of the toaster: an intentional account (of human ingenuity) and a causal account of how to make it and why it works. One does not need either the house god or the toaster to realize that the accounts we human beings can give do not allow the fusing of causes and intentions. Even the primitive man, who cooked food over the fire, needed to have two such accounts: an account why the fire cooked' the food (instead of making it wet, for instance) and what he had to do to enable\u0026rsquo; the fire to cook the food. His desire that his food was cooked did not cook the food; he had to appeal to something outside his intentions to cook it.\nIn religion, the will and cause are fused. This fusion is accounted for by the EI account that religion is: it is the revelation of God. That is to say, no human being could ever produce an account (of objects in the world) that fuses causes and intentions together. If we could, we could easily prove that religion is a human construct. That is why the atheist' explanation of religion revolves around the (probable) causes of religion and religious beliefs. That is, they want to provide a causal account for the coming-into-being of an explanatorily intelligible account of the Cosmos. Hence also the reason why they are not able to capture their object of enquiry: as that which makes both itself and the Cosmos explanatorily intelligible. Instead, they presuppose what they have to prove: that God does not exist; people are causally prone to believe in supernatural\u0026rsquo; entities and so on and so forth.\nIn other words, if a science of religion, which not theology, comes into being and explains the origin and the reproduction of religion (not of this or that religion but of religion as such) in human societies, then my story is quite simply false.\n","tags":[],"title":"Intentional and Causal explanations","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/intentional-and-causal-explanations/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","Indian traditions","translation"],"content":"The problem about translating \u0026lsquo;sruti\u0026rsquo; is not as easy as it has been made out to be. Is it possible to translate it as \u0026lsquo;revelation\u0026rsquo; or even as \u0026lsquo;divine revelation\u0026rsquo;? Because it has so far been translated in this manner, we can only conclude that it is indeed possible to do so. Next issue: how accurate is this translation? The answer to this question depends upon what \u0026lsquo;revelation\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;divine revelation\u0026rsquo; is supposed to mean.\nIf one does not want to prejudge the issue about the nature of Indian traditions, in the first place, we need to give credence to the fact that \u0026lsquo;sruti\u0026rsquo; is what is heard. Committing the Veda\u0026rsquo;s into writing has always lagged behind the transmission of the oral tradition. Not only because writing was a later invention, but also because singing the hymns in a right manner (which has always been a question of oral transmission in India) is as important as reciting the verses accurately. Furthermore, unlike in other places in the world, the discovery of script did not put an end to oral transmission in India. Even to this day, literacy supports orality, a fact of great significance when we discuss about the alleged conflict between orality and literacy.\nThe second point is that Veda\u0026rsquo;s are supposed to be \u0026lsquo;apaurusheya\u0026rsquo;. How to understand this Sanskrit word? It merely translates as \u0026rsquo;not (of ) from purusha\u0026rsquo;. Who or what is the Purusha? Is there a contrast here between \u0026lsquo;Purusha\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;Prakruti\u0026rsquo;? The latter can be broadly translated as \u0026lsquo;Nature\u0026rsquo;. Is the claim that the \u0026lsquo;sruti\u0026rsquo; originates in Nature? If this reading is acceptable, then unless Prakruti is seen as \u0026lsquo;divine\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;sruti\u0026rsquo; cannot be translated as Divine revelation.\nThirdly, even if this contrast is not drawn, it is difficult to see how \u0026lsquo;apaurusheya\u0026rsquo; can be translated as \u0026lsquo;divine\u0026rsquo; revelation without making the notion of \u0026lsquo;divinity\u0026rsquo; into an unexplicated concept. The \u0026lsquo;divine\u0026rsquo; in the Semitic religions is an entity with person-like characteristics: God has Will, purpose and acts according to His will. (These properties make some entity into a person). The word \u0026lsquo;apaurusheya\u0026rsquo; denies this notion of personhood (translating \u0026lsquo;purusha\u0026rsquo; as \u0026lsquo;person\u0026rsquo;) to that which delivers the message. Is it something like \u0026ldquo;akaashavani\u0026rdquo; (literally the voice of the sky)? In that case what does the notion of divinity mean if we call sruti the \u0026lsquo;divine revelation\u0026rsquo;? What is \u0026lsquo;divine\u0026rsquo; about \u0026lsquo;akaasha\u0026rsquo;? In any case, what is \u0026lsquo;divine\u0026rsquo; about \u0026lsquo;sruti\u0026rsquo;? Consequently, those who want to translate apaurusheya as `divine revelation\u0026rsquo; will have to build a theology first. That is, they have to explain what \u0026lsquo;divinity\u0026rsquo; means before assuring us that sruti is \u0026lsquo;divine revelation\u0026rsquo;.\nFourthly, what is the revelation in the Veda\u0026rsquo;s? Only that which is hidden can be revealed, if we go by the meaning of the word. I have yet to come across someone who is able to tell me what was \u0026lsquo;hidden\u0026rsquo; before the Vedas \u0026lsquo;revealed\u0026rsquo; it to us. Is it the existence of Indra? Or of agni? Or of Soma? Or of what? Does sruti reveal what is hidden from \u0026lsquo;hearing\u0026rsquo;? Or does it reveal what is hidden from sight? Or does it reveal what is hidden behind the veil of ignorance? In which case, to what is it revealed? To the ear? To the eyes? To Manas? In short, it simply raises finitely many questions without ever having the hope of answering them without constructing some elaborate theory.\nThe third and the fourth point tell us that linguistic translation is not the issue here, but one of theoretical interpretation. Consequently, asking a Sanskritist will not solve our problem. The Sanskritist will simply say that he has been \u0026rsquo;taught\u0026rsquo; that Sruti means \u0026lsquo;revelation\u0026rsquo; or even \u0026lsquo;divine revelation\u0026rsquo;.\n[ ‘Apaurusheya’ has absolutely nothing to do with ‘supernatural’; nor can it ever mean ‘of divine origin’. The Veda’s are not ‘divine revelations’ of any kind. The Indian traditions cannot make sense of such terms. ]\n","tags":[],"title":"Apaurusheya, shruti and revelation: theoretical dispute","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/apaurusheya-shruti-and-revelation-theoretical-dispute/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","religion","explanatorily intelligible"],"content":"Of course, the concept of explanatorily intelligible account is not easy to grasp: if it were, the \u0026lsquo;heathens\u0026rsquo; would not be blind to the existence of religion. However, that does not mean we cannot grasp it either.\nI am glad you are beginning to see why the story about \u0026lsquo;Jesus as a Yogi\u0026rsquo; (Sankrant\u0026rsquo;s famous interpretation) is wrong; and why discussions on Sulekha drive me sometimes to despair and the believers (remember Gargoyle Minimus?) into utter rage. Why I keep saying that we think we understand Christianity (Pradip Gangopadhyay even claims that no Christian has understood the teachings of Christ, except himself), whereas we simply do not know what we are talking about.\nAdding what, you ask, makes Christianity into a religion? Of course, subordination one\u0026rsquo;s will to God makes one into a believer (not a virtuous person). That is only possible if you believe in God and in that the Cosmos expresses His Will. (The notion of Cosmos expressing His will should not be interpreted as LILA. Our ideas of LILA have nothing to do with the notion of God expressing His Will.) God made a covenant with the people of Israel that He would send someone to liberate them. The Christ figure is this promised one. The Christians claim that the Christ came not just to deliver the people of Israel from the clutches of the Devil but the whole of humankind. Only by following Christ can one hope to be delivered from the clutches of the Devil. (This is the notion of salvation, which has nothing to do with Moksha. Whether or not you are saved depends not on you but on God\u0026rsquo;s Grace, i.e., whether or not He will effectively save you. Why should God love the Sinner that you are? The answer to this question is what God\u0026rsquo;s Grace is all about.) So one must believe not only in God, but also in Christ. That is, that God has fulfilled His promise and that it is His Will that the humankind follows Christ. So, subordination your will to the Will of God is identical to believing in Christ and following the latter, if you are a Christian.\nWho is the Devil? According to Christianity, our gods are the minions of this Devil. By believing in these gods, we prove (to the believer) that Christianity is TRUE. We need to be saved from the clutches of these Indian gods. Because, the ONLY result of us worshipping the Indian gods is eternal (to the end of TIME itself) torture in Hell. Of course, we think that Ganesha, etc. is a form or manifestation of GOD, but we are deceived in this belief. Ganesha, Vishnu, etc. are not manifestations of GOD but of the Devil, who has deceived us into thinking that these figures are manifestations of GOD. Christ is the only person who can lead us to GOD. All others will lead us to Hell, whether the Buddha or the Shankara, or whoever else.\nIn other words, you need to keep the Devil as much in the centre as GOD Himself. Without GOD telling us WHO He is and HOW to worship Him (this is what revelation is), we cannot find GOD. We will find only the Devil in our search for GOD. Because GOD loves us, He wants to save us from the clutches of the Devil. (From now on, do not think of Devil as something abstract, but see all the Indian gods as the Devil himself, and all our gurus and Acharyas as his minions. All they can do is lead you to Hell, even though they promise you that they will lead you to GOD.) Hence, in His infinite mercy, GOD sent Jesus to save us from the clutches of the Devil.\nIf you can understand the above text (and not use some Indian interpretation to make sense of it), you are beginning to grasp what religion is. (Especially, the religions that Judaism, Christianity and Islam are.)\n","tags":[],"title":"Why Heathens are blind to religion?","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/why-heathens-are-blind-to-religion/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","stories","explanatorily intelligible"],"content":"(I) In a Greek story, Persephone spends part of the year in the underworld and part of the year on earth, and winter is caused by her mother Demeter\u0026rsquo;s sorrow at parting, and spring by her mother\u0026rsquo;s joy at reuniting. When taken at face value, this story makes the change of seasons be because of someone\u0026rsquo;s emotions, and hence intelligible.\nTwo points with respect to this. (a) I do not think that the story itself would say that winter and spring were caused by the emotions of the mother. Instead, it would say: \u0026ldquo;her sorrow became, her joy became…\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;thus her sorrow is, her joy is…\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;that is how seasons came into being\u0026rdquo; or some such formulation. That is because, in my view, this story does not portray causal or other relations between events. That is why it remains beautiful to this day. (b) Here, you are using \u0026lsquo;intelligibility\u0026rsquo; as \u0026lsquo;understandability\u0026rsquo;. Having or experiencing emotions is not seen as an intentional state, i.e., not as a propositional attitude. \u0026lsquo;He is sad because his mother died\u0026rsquo; is glossed as \u0026lsquo;he believes that he is sad because his mother died\u0026rsquo;, or as \u0026lsquo;he is sad because he believes that his mother died\u0026rsquo;. (One indicator for testing the role played by the \u0026rsquo;that\u0026rsquo; clause is: the truth value of the entire sentence does not get affected by the truth value of the sentence occurring after the \u0026rsquo;that\u0026rsquo; clause. That is, the \u0026rsquo;that\u0026rsquo; clause is not truth-functional unlike say \u0026lsquo;or\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;and\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;if…then\u0026rsquo; clauses.) It is important to emphasize that the notion of \u0026lsquo;intelligibility\u0026rsquo; requires that it is an expression of an intentional state and emotions are not seen as intentional states.\n(II) The piecemeal intelligible accounts of seasons, thunder, etc., are seen to culminate in the grand unified intelligible account, that is religion.\nAgain two points. (a) If thunder, etc., express, say, the emotions of some beings, it makes them intelligible only in the sense of \u0026lsquo;understandable\u0026rsquo;. (b) Religion need not explain thunder, etc. to be an explanatorily intelligible account. One can say, for instance, that thunder is caused by natural factors and then say, \u0026rsquo;that is how God has willed it\u0026rsquo; to get us there. Do not forget that religion not only makes the world intelligible but does so explanatorily. (All intentional explanations make actions intelligible; that does not make the former into \u0026lsquo;religions\u0026rsquo;.)\n(III) In Karnataka, people are pouring into mosques and temples to pray for rain. Does the idea that prayer can influence the Deity to cause rain imply that people have an intelligible account of the rain?\nThree responses. (a) One way to account for this is to look at how I speak of \u0026lsquo;rain dance\u0026rsquo; in my \u0026ldquo;We shall not cease…\u0026rdquo; (It occurs in the context of my reflections on stories towards the end.) (b) People might say that the deity might bring down rain if (i) he wants it or (ii) \u0026lsquo;wills\u0026rsquo; it (though in Kannada, the expressions for \u0026lsquo;willing\u0026rsquo; coincide with \u0026lsquo;wanting to\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;desirous of\u0026rsquo; and such like). It need not imply that this attitude arises out having an explanatorily intelligible account of the Cosmos: the power of the deity might reside in its ability to bring down the rain one way or another. (iii) Could one interpret this as an expression of them having a religion? Of course. That is how it has been interpreted thus far.\n(IV) I read somewhere that in some villages, the \u0026ldquo;marriage of a frog\u0026rdquo; is done to bring rainfall, but let\u0026rsquo;s take this as a made-up example if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t happen. Now, here, there need not be any intelligibility; for instance, There is no theory of the natural forces having intentions, etc. here. So this is an account of phenomena with no intelligibility?\nThe example is not an account (i.e. is not an explanation) but a description of what some people do. The sentences between square brackets (I have added them to your formulations) begin the process of explanation by surmising a probabilistic relation in their \u0026lsquo;understanding\u0026rsquo; of the world. Thus, yes, you provide an explanation that is not intentional.\n(V) Dadaji Athavale of Swadhyaya teaches that when we sing praises of devas in bhajans or mantras, we are not propitiating some external deity; we are rather reminding ourselves of certain qualities so as to imbibe them, inculcate them in ourselves. Perhaps a modern theory, but Indra,Agni,Vayu, etc., are not personalized natural forces, but represent divine qualities that we aspire to. Does this idea represent no intelligibility?\nTwo responses. (a) Dadaji\u0026rsquo;s teaching is one possible \u0026lsquo;intentional\u0026rsquo; explanation of why we pray. (It is not mine, but that is irrelevant for now.) Idem., about the modern theory. (b) There are three questions here that require separation: (i) what are deities? The answer is that they are human qualities allegorized; (ii) why do we pray? This is provided with an intentional explanation; (iii) what is prayer? The answer is that it is an act of reminding and not an act of propitiation.\nFinally, yet again, two more points. (i) Do not forget that religion brings causal and intentional explanations together and all intentional explanations make an action or an event intelligible. Religion requires a fusion of both these two types of explanation. (ii) Do not forget that religion is an account of the Cosmos, i.e. all that was, is, and shall be. This includes the primordial plasma; our ancestors; ghosts and spirits if they exist; everything that could ever exist in this universe. Nothing is so far (back or ahead) in time that it does not belong to this universe; nothing is so far away (in space) that it is not a part of this universe. Religion makes this entity explanatorily intelligible.\n","tags":[],"title":"Stories and intelligibility","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/stories-and-intelligibility/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","religion","explanatorily intelligible"],"content":"I\nLet me begin by clarifying what the notion of intelligibility says.\nThe first thing to keep in mind is that Religion makes (i.e. transforms, renders, or any such synonym) the Cosmos (used interchangeably with \u0026rsquo;the world\u0026rsquo;, \u0026rsquo;the Universe\u0026rsquo;, etc) into an entity that is intelligible. In the process, and by virtue of it, the explanatory account makes itself intelligible as well. That is, Religion is an explanatory intelligible account of both itself and the Cosmos.\nWhen used as a characteristic (or a property) of a belief, \u0026lsquo;intelligibility\u0026rsquo; talks about the meaning of that belief. When we say a belief (or a sentence, a set of sentences, a set of propositions, a story, a description, a theory, etc.) is intelligible we mean that it is \u0026lsquo;understandable\u0026rsquo;. Of a set of sentences that conveys nonsense (i.e. does not make sense), we say that it is unintelligible. So, in this sense, any story or explanation is always intelligible if it conveys meaning.\nWhat makes some thing (an entity, an action, or an event) intelligible? (This is how we have to pose the question, if we need to understand what Religion is and what it does.) As a first approximation, something (an event, an action, or an entity), is intelligible if, and only if, it expresses the intentions of an agent (and not otherwise). That is to say, if some purpose or the other is exemplified in an event (like opening a door), an action (like eating), or an object (like a check) then such events, actions and entities are intelligible. Thus intelligibility presupposes an agent who not only intends (i.e. hopes, desires, wills, etc) but is also able to express them (in objects, events and actions). This is an epistemological claim: it lays out the necessary condition for some entity to become intelligible. This is very important, and if need be, it can be elaborated upon further.\nAs a second approximation, we can say that an intentional explanation makes some thing (event, action or entity) intelligible. These things become exemplifications of the intentional states (beliefs, hopes, desires, …) of some agent or another. Why am I a Professor? One \u0026lsquo;why\u0026rsquo; refers to the cause: the answer might be, that is because I have been appointed as a professor by the governing Council of the Ghent University. The second \u0026lsquo;why\u0026rsquo; refers to my intention: because I want to to do research and teach. The second is an intentional explanation.\nIn the empirical world we live in, we observe that (a) one and the same action might express different intentions; (b) there are always unintended effects; (c) we might or might not be able to realize our intentions, etc. That is to say, there is no one-to-one correspondence between some intention and some action. Why is this so? Because, there are regularities in Nature and, we assume, these regularities (say, causes) interfere between our intentions and their embodiments.\nWhat religion says is this: these regularities (say causes) and the intentions of the Agent fall together. That is, when we speak of God, His intentions and the causes are the same. Such an account is an explanatory intelligible account of the universe.\nThis account itself embodies the intention of the very same Agent as well: not only is the Universe made explanatorily intelligible but also the account that makes the Universe into such a place. That is religion itself is also explanatorily intelligible: God gave religion to human kind because He took mercy (or loves) Humanity and wants to save them (for instance).\nIn other words, both the Universe and the story about it are explanatorily intelligible. That is, in religion (and only in religion) both the causal and the intentional explanation come together and are fused into one another.\nThat is why \u0026lsquo;God\u0026rsquo; is an empirical constraint on religion. His \u0026rsquo;existence\u0026rsquo; has to do with the kind of beings we (humans) are. Religion does not need \u0026lsquo;God\u0026rsquo; to be explanatorily intelligible. Why? Something (an event, action, object) is intelligible to us (humans) if, and only if, that something is an expression of an agent with will, desire, hope, … etc. That is the reason why God is a \u0026lsquo;person\u0026rsquo; in the empirical religions that exist within the human communities. There could be a religion (but not with beings like us humans) that totally dispenses with \u0026lsquo;God\u0026rsquo;.\nI claim that Indian stories are not like this. Whether they are about the Origin of the Cosmos, or about Krishna, they do not make either themselves or the world into explanatorily intelligible entities. These stories are intelligible, to be sure. So is a mathematical or physical theory. I claim that stories do not even explain, but that is for later. For now, what we need to know is what the notion of \u0026lsquo;intelligibility\u0026rsquo; says and does not say.\nII\nIf it is said that the epistemological claim lays down the necessary condition for anything to become intelligible, is this not applicable to \u0026lsquo;belief\u0026rsquo; as well? (After all, there is nothing objectionable to a metaphysics that considers a \u0026lsquo;belief system\u0026rsquo; as a particular kind of entity as well.) That is, does a \u0026lsquo;belief system\u0026rsquo; become intelligible because it instantiates the intentional states of some agent? This is a very tricky question, which is best approached by stages.\nIf the world is the expression of God\u0026rsquo;s Will, all statements that describe the world are \u0026lsquo;intelligible\u0026rsquo; because these statements are necessarily about God intends. Here, there are two issues: (a) what God intends; and (b) what we think God intends (our ascriptions might or might not be right.) To help us with respect to what we think God intends, (c) there is God\u0026rsquo;s revelation. But, how we understand this revelation is itself non-trivially dependent on our abilities as well. And so on.\nIf one could exhaustively describe (a), then such a description is completely intelligible to all. Let us call this \u0026lsquo;Objective intelligibility\u0026rsquo;. However, the possibility of providing such a description is denied to us, human beings. Consequently, all human beings can do is give a partial description. Whatever be the nature of this partial description, it is intelligible to human beings because, despite its partiality, it is nevertheless a description of the intentions (as we understand them) of God.\n2.1. All human beings have the ability to provide a partial description of God\u0026rsquo;s Will. This ability is given to us by God in two senses: (i) we too have a will and this allows us to grasp the world as an expression of Someone\u0026rsquo;s Will. (ii) There is an innate sense of divinity in each human being that makes one search for God. (The worship of the Devil is possible only because of this: in our search for God, he makes us believe that he is the true One.)\n2.2. In secularized terms, what the above paragraphs are saying is this: meaning (it is being used here as a synonym for \u0026lsquo;intelligibility\u0026rsquo;) of linguistic utterances is guaranteed by the nature of the world itself. Let us call this the notion of \u0026lsquo;Objective meaning\u0026rsquo;. Human beings can understand each other because their talk is about the world. And this world is the same to all.\nEach human being can only describe (b), that is, what he takes to be the Will of God. What any individual takes (b) to be the case is a contingent matter: he might or might not be intelligible to another human being who provides another partial description of the world. That is, whether or not some description is intelligible or not to some person or the other is a contingent matter. Let us call this \u0026lsquo;Subjective intelligibility\u0026rsquo;. Even if the world guarantees that we can understand each other, it does not imply that everything that is said is also effectively understood. That depends on other contingent factors. However, in principle, we can understand each other. In secular terms, this would suggest that, even if objective in principle, meaning is subjective in nature. The meaning of linguistic utterances are subjective, i.e. \u0026ldquo;meaning is in the head\u0026rdquo;. Each utterance means something to the speaker, which may or may not be the listener\u0026rsquo;s meaning.\nGod reveals Himself in the Universe, and tells you what His intentions are . That is to say, (c) enables a more accurate description of the world than (b) does. But it is not (a). It is not (a), because your understanding of the God\u0026rsquo;s revelation is dependent on God\u0026rsquo;s intentions, which you cannot know on your own. Further, it is up to Him to decide whether or not He gives you the ability to understand the revelation of His intentions. That is to say, (c) says that it is up to Him to decide (i) how much you understand God\u0026rsquo;s Will and (ii) how accurate your understanding is. But what is indisputable is that this intelligibility is superior when compared to (b). Let us call this \u0026lsquo;Inter-subjective intelligibility\u0026rsquo;. This is superior to \u0026lsquo;subjective intelligibility\u0026rsquo; but inferior to \u0026lsquo;objective intelligibility\u0026rsquo;.\nIn secularized terms, the notion that meaning is somehow \u0026lsquo;shared\u0026rsquo; between speakers is superior to the notion of \u0026lsquo;subjective\u0026rsquo; meaning. This inter-subjectivity, however, is guaranteed by the nature of the world and is possible because we share something or the other in common.\nWhere does this bring us with respect to the question, whether the intelligibility of a belief system depends on it being the expression of some agent\u0026rsquo;s intentional state? The answer is a yes and a no. The \u0026lsquo;yes\u0026rsquo; part refers to the theological underpinning of the question, while the \u0026rsquo;no\u0026rsquo; refers to its secularization. Because of this, the relation between language and the world must emerge as a problem about reference and meaning in theories and philosophies of language. How can language refer? What is meaning?\nLet us then picture another culture, the Indian one, which thinks that intentionality is an illusion, even if a necessary one. If the epistemological claim is applicable to them too, it would follow that they would find the world (as it is) indescribable. What is describable would be \u0026rsquo;true\u0026rsquo; only to the extent the illusion about the world is a necessary one. That is, they would think that the description of the world is both true and false. The world \u0026ldquo;as it really is\u0026rdquo; cannot be described by language and only the illusory world is so describable. However, because they think that the \u0026rsquo;truth\u0026rsquo; about the world is the realization about the necessity of illusion, they would have to be more concerned about the role of language in leading from the world of illusion to the realization about its illusory nature. Consequently, their reflections about language would be less oriented towards \u0026lsquo;meaning\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;reference\u0026rsquo;. (That is to say, this would not constitute their primary preoccupation.) That means, in so far as they reflected about language they would be more concerned about the syntactical nature of language and would tend to locate \u0026lsquo;meaning\u0026rsquo; in the syntax of language. (They would have to be forerunners in developing a syntactical theory of \u0026lsquo;meaning\u0026rsquo;.)\nIII\nLet me pursue the reflections presented earlier on intelligibility. (It tried to suggest that the notion of \u0026lsquo;understandability\u0026rsquo; can be extracted from the notion of intelligibility.) They appear logically related but I am not sure that what I describe is also their logical relation.\nWhat does it mean to speak of \u0026lsquo;beliefs\u0026rsquo; as objects? \u0026lsquo;Beliefs\u0026rsquo; are what one \u0026lsquo;believes in\u0026rsquo;, i.e. they are propositions (and not sentences). A proposition is the \u0026lsquo;meaning\u0026rsquo; of a sentence. So, a metaphysics that allows beliefs to exist as objects in the world must make \u0026lsquo;meaning\u0026rsquo; a part of the world as well. So, the notion of \u0026lsquo;meaning of the world\u0026rsquo; is the root, from which the notion of \u0026rsquo;linguistic meaning\u0026rsquo; develops. That is, the world has \u0026lsquo;meaning\u0026rsquo;; thus language has meaning and thus propositions exist.\nIndian culture is probably concerned with understanding language not in terms of meaning and reference but in terms of language as speech. Why? I am not sure. But if this is the case, and it is true that (partly because of this) the emphasis is on syntax, then Mantras and reflections about their nature and status would have been of interest to many Indian linguists. Correct speaking and correctly enunciating the Mantra\u0026rsquo;s would have also interested them very much. (Mantra is not a chant; it is a paradigm example of speech, in that case.) If you couple this with the story about the Ritual in \u0026lsquo;The Heathen…\u0026rsquo;, this orientation appears to become almost predictable.\nEven though they would have the notion of the correspondence theory of truth, it would be more oriented towards the notion of \u0026rsquo;truth telling\u0026rsquo; (because of the emphasis on speech instead of language). Truth would be non-linguistic in nature: truth-telling will help in our search for truth. (If you interpret this in ethical terms, you will get the recommendation that one must become \u0026lsquo;virtuous\u0026rsquo; in order to seek \u0026rsquo;enlightenment\u0026rsquo;.)\n\u0026ldquo;How is language useful in searching for truth?\u0026rdquo; This is how one could characterize their research question on language. \u0026ldquo;Through what kind of speech can you achieve enlightenment?\u0026rdquo; This is another way of formulating the same issue, even though the questions are not the same. The second would ineluctably refer to the Mantras: all traditions that focus on enlightenment would probably strive to answer this question. This is another way of saying that some kinds of speaking (mantra, japa, etc) are an inseparable moment in achieving \u0026rsquo;enlightenment\u0026rsquo; in all the Indian traditions. More generally put \u0026ldquo;speaking in the right way\u0026rdquo; (whether interpreted ethically or ritually or linguistically) would be of paramount importance to the Indian culture.\nBecause truth is non-linguistic in nature, no person can say that he has found the truth. Nor can he describe what it is. It is experiential; one can guide the other using speech towards this end because that is what speech is: a guide.\nIf truth is the goal and truth is experiential, then the (\u0026rsquo;theoretical\u0026rsquo; and practical) reflections would be on the nature of this experience and on the impediments to having this experience. (Maaya and/or avidya conceived as impediments to finding truth.) But Maaya and/or avidya are also experiential (in the sense that they are part of the day-to-day experience in the world). Consequently, the basic focus of the Indian traditions would have to be on the nature of \u0026ldquo;Experience\u0026rdquo; (conceived both as truth and as an impediment to finding it). Such knowledge \u0026lsquo;about\u0026rsquo; experience must itself be experiential in nature. That is, it cannot be looked at as \u0026lsquo;propositional knowledge\u0026rsquo; or a \u0026rsquo;theory\u0026rsquo; about experience. Consequently, Indian \u0026lsquo;philosophy\u0026rsquo; will not make much sense, if looked at as theories. Instead, such a view will be a caricature of what they are and what they do. Indian \u0026lsquo;philosophies\u0026rsquo; are not interesting for what they say but for what they do and how they do it.\nWithin the western intellectual tradition, there is also another (perhaps more interesting) trend than the one which looks at meaning as a furniture in the world. The \u0026rsquo;nominalists\u0026rsquo;, for instance, focus on words and their \u0026lsquo;conventional\u0026rsquo; meaning. What is of interest to us is that they went the farthest in developing ideas about linguistic tropes, especially analogies and \u0026lsquo;metaphors\u0026rsquo;. How to look at them?\nThe answer looks deceptively simple. They stick to the idea of language describing the Will of God (as revealed in the world), but suggest that we could never do it, even with the help of God\u0026rsquo;s revelation (in the Bible and through the message of the Church). That is to say, our descriptions of God\u0026rsquo;s intentions are couched in terms of descriptions of ourselves and our intention. Consequently, our description of God\u0026rsquo;s Will (thus of the world) is more of through analogies with a description of our own. The focus, thus, shifts to \u0026lsquo;conventional\u0026rsquo; meanings precisely because it accepts objective intelligibility as given and on the role played by analogies in describing it.\n","tags":[],"title":"Intelligibility: Religion, Belief, Meaning","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/intelligibility-religion-belief-meaning/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","basics","criticism"],"content":"I have also come across expressions of similar thoughts and feelings both in India and in Europe and the United States. However, I think there are multiple grounds that generate such questions. Here are some I have been able to identify.\nWhen people hear me say that the western intellectuals of the last three hundred years or more are completely wrong, invariably people skeptically wonder whether I think I am such a genius. Anticipating this (mostly) unexpressed question, I tell them that it is not a matter of psychology; I show that my theory answers the question (without making ad hoc assumptions) why the western intellectuals have been unable to see what I see. Even though they fall silent at this point, I suspect they do so not because they are convinced but because they do not know what else to say.\nI have often heard that people think of me as very arrogant because of the confidence' with which I espouse and defend my theory. This perception arises from their deeply held (often, implicit) belief that sciences of the social are not possible. They seem to think that all claims about society and culture are mere opinions and that one ought to be modest in expressing them. Bold claims are equated with strong ego\u0026rsquo; and arrogance because one is merely expressing one\u0026rsquo;s opinion of oneself. Therefore, when I say that without the mistakes of the earlier generations, there was no possibility that I could what I think I am doing, again, they fall silent. Once more, the silence is not because my argument convinces them but because they do not know how to continue such a discussion further.\nAt the same time, they also like' the following sort of claim: \u0026quot;I am not very intelligent but, sometimes, the discovery of truth befalls a not-so-gifted person.\u0026quot; This appears to tickle them enormously, and they are prepared to forgive this kind of ego-flattery\u0026rsquo; as long as it is clothed as self-deprecation.\nIn India, I suspect that yet another consideration plays a role. That has something to do with the relation that some Indians have with the so-called NRIs. On the one hand, I notice that some Indians are peculiarly subservient to the NRIs; on the other, the same people also show contempt to the NRIs. Such people want to demonstrate to the NRIs that they, those who live in India, are somehow superior and `know\u0026rsquo; their society and culture better than the NRIs do. They present themselves as privileged citizens of India by denigrating the NRIs in many subtle and not-so-subtle ways. While busy playing out this role, they are also servile in many ways. I have not figured out this phenomenon; I do not even know how specific this is to the Indians.\nCompounding these is what someone once called a \u0026ldquo;school boy conception of science\u0026rdquo;, which probably dominates the Indian intellectual circles. This attitude makes one believe that scientists are like smart pupils, who sit down and quickly work out the solution to some problem or another. There is very little appreciation of the messy and fragmentary nature of scientific research, which is nothing like this smart school boy' conception. Many NRIs I know also share this conception. Having been successful in some or another endeavor in the West, they believe that all they have to do is use their brains\u0026rsquo; to solve' the problems in India. They seem to assume that social sciences merely awaited the arrival of such intelligent\u0026rsquo; people and that, during the course of all these centuries, only idiots populated these domains. I do not know which of the two groups is more tiring or boring: these types of NRIs or the group I speak of in the previous paragraph.\n","tags":[],"title":"Why people resist to think critically?","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/why-people-resist-to-think-critically/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","basics","colonial consciousness"],"content":" I have come to accept that the most interesting facts that a theory explains are those of the theory itself. Furthermore, a \u0026rsquo;theory\u0026rsquo;, which collects all kinds of facts first and tries to \u0026rsquo;explain\u0026rsquo; them subsequently, is worse than having no theory. Such a theory is completely ad hoc and is cognitively uninteresting. It is pernicious too because it generates the belief that one understands such facts, when, in fact, all one has is an ad hoc explanation. In this sense, I have not collected evidence for the statement that \u0026lsquo;Indians accept European reports as descriptions of their world\u0026rsquo;; nor am I explaining these assembled facts.\nI do not think that it matters all that much (in the context of evaluating a theory) how and on what basis one arrives at a hypothesis. Kekulé dreamt of the serpent swallowing its own tail to propose the structure of the benzene ring, Watson half-dreamt the structure of the DNA molecule, and Einstein\u0026rsquo;s special theory of relativity was born out of the frustration that cars continuously overtook the tram he was traveling in. I have no clue about the psychological processes involved in the generation of a hypothesis and I certainly have no insight into mine. The more interesting question is about why one should entertain one specific hypothesis instead of another.\nHowever, this does not mean that there are no indications even though they mean different things within the context of different hypotheses. The popularity of post-colonial thought and subaltern historiography among some intellectual circles in India; the phenomenon of Orientalism that Edward Said draws our attention to; the mantras about anti-Brahmanism that are popular among many Dalit circles; the lack of understanding among the intellectuals (both Indian and western) about \u0026rsquo;the religions\u0026rsquo; of India and \u0026rsquo;the Indian caste system\u0026rsquo;; the monochromic repetition of \u0026lsquo;secularist\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;anti-secularist\u0026rsquo; slogans; the absence of theorizing about the Indian society and culture by the Indian intellectuals; the opposition between the so-called right wing \u0026lsquo;Hindu Fundamentalists\u0026rsquo; and the so-called left wing \u0026lsquo;secularists\u0026rsquo; with the so-called centrist \u0026lsquo;Gandhians\u0026rsquo; in the middle… These are some of the indications of the malaise that I talk about. There are many ad hoc theories that float around that explain one or the other of these phenomena differently than how I tackle them. Hopefully, soon, a time will come when we can evaluate these explanations against my hypothesis.\nThe hypothesis about colonial consciousness, which I am developing on and off, has helped me answer different kinds of problems. I am able to answer why colonialism as a project is both immoral and yet appeared to many as a morally praiseworthy educational project; I am able to predict that most Indians (if not all) would fail to provide reference to the words they use (almost) as a matter of habit. It has helped me understand why both the contemporary Indian intellectuals and the older generations of Sanskrit pundits are fossils, as far as our needs are concerned. It has provided me with focal points to do research into Indian history as well as indicate that both the Islamic and the British rule are variants of colonialism. In short, it has proved cognitively very productive for my research. If I were to develop the hypothesis successfully, I would be in a position not only to differentiate varieties of colonialism from each other but also varieties in the colonial consciousness. Furthermore, it will raise novel questions about the relationship between cultures (as configurations of learning) and massive socio-political processes like colonialism. These are reasons enough for me to continue my work on the hypothesis.\nIf you are not willing to accept the statement I make about the Indians (viz., they accept the reports of European experience as descriptions of Indian society and culture) as true, I am not surprised: as I have already indicated, this fact is in fact my hypothesis. Do you have a better hypothesis?\n","tags":[],"title":"Is the hypothesis about colonial consciousness ad hoc?","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/is-the-hypothesis-about-colonial-consciousness-ad-hoc/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","NRI"],"content":"Irrespective of what Hindu kids are told we have, they will discover later that that all the beliefs they have heard and been taught about, everything about the Ten Commandments and the manifestations of the \u0026lsquo;brahman\u0026rsquo;, and so on are based on stories. They will discover too that these gods of their, these \u0026lsquo;manifestations\u0026rsquo; of Brahman, display immoral and disgusting behaviors: like incest, adultery, lying, cheating, murder, and so on and so forth. They will discover furthermore that there is no theology worth speaking of in the Indian traditions, and they will become one deeply ashamed Indian if they come across the Christian evangelicals or writers like the future Kripals or Courtrights.

If we restrict ourselves to terms like \u0026lsquo;Deva\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;Dharma\u0026rsquo; and such like, the worry is not just that their translations distort the meaning of these words (as we use them in our native languages) but that they suggest something (by way of reference and meaning) that does not even exist in these languages.\nWith respect to some of these words, we can build a reasonable case in defense of this stance. That is because there is at least some theory about religion that we accept (however provisional or conditional such an acceptance might be) using which we can show that \u0026lsquo;Deva\u0026rsquo; cannot be translated as \u0026lsquo;God\u0026rsquo;. So far so good.\nCould we generalize this point to say that no Sanskrit word (or any word from a native language) should be translated into English? Such an attempt would face two kinds of problems: (a) Are all translations (from one language into another) then a folly? Should we take this stance, then it appears to me that we would become so absurdly parochial that no one would take us seriously. The very idea that contributions from one language (or some one\u0026rsquo;s culture) are contributions to humanity would be undercut. So, we would have to allow for some kinds of transformations of the meaning of words in the process of translation as inevitable to an understanding of people and languages different from us. (There are other reasons too, but we need not go deeper into them now.) (b) We need to put restrictions on the translations of only some words from the native languages or from Sanskrit and, in each case, we need to give a reasoned defense of our stance. How are we going to defend these restrictions in a reasonable way?\nThe first way of doing so is to appeal to a theory that some of us accept and build arguments on that basis. Note, however, that the acceptance of some theory or another is itself subject to certain cognitive constraints; not every set of sentences can be called a \u0026rsquo;theory we accept\u0026rsquo;. Living in the twenty-first century is both a privilege and a pain: we know something about the nature of human knowledge and the status of scientific theories. Such a theory is not built for most of the words we use in Sanskrit or other native languages. For instance, such is definitely not the case for the word \u0026lsquo;Dharma\u0026rsquo;. We know of no theory of Dharma that meets the cognitive criteria that we expect a scientific theory to meet.\nThere is another way of approaching this task. Where we do not have an explicit theory to help us along the way, there we can appeal to something like an \u0026ldquo;intuitive theory\u0026rdquo; that cultures transmit to their members. Has the Indian culture of today transmitted an ability (to us) that allows us to make sense (intuitive or otherwise) of some of these words? Here is where, I am afraid, the shoe is going to pinch. I think that it has not. In one particular area at least, we are as clueless what these words mean as any other westerner!\n5.1. Consider the following words we effortlessly use, while talking about human beings: \u0026ldquo;ahamkara\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Chitta\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Manas\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Bhavana\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Raaga-Dvesha\u0026rdquo; and their kin. Bracket away (for the time being) what you have learnt about these words from some text or another (authored by people like Patanjali or Abhinavagupta or Shankarachaarya or whoever) because millions upon millions of people use these words without having read such texts. Having done that, ask the following questions to yourself: What is \u0026lsquo;manas\u0026rsquo;? What, in the human psychology you intuitively know, does it refer to? What is Chitta? What is the difference between \u0026ldquo;Buddhi\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Manas\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Chitta\u0026rdquo;? Is there a difference between \u0026ldquo;manobhaavana\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Manovikaara\u0026rdquo;? Is \u0026ldquo;Chittashuddhi\u0026rdquo; the same as not having any \u0026ldquo;Manovikaara\u0026rdquo;? If yes, \u0026ldquo;chitta\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Manas\u0026rdquo; refer to the same entity; if no, what is the difference? Was Duryodhana an \u0026ldquo;ahamkari\u0026rdquo; or a \u0026ldquo;Durahamkari\u0026rdquo;? What is the difference between the two? How do you identify these two states as being different? And so on and so forth.\n5.2. It is my claim that you are as clueless as any other westerner. What he learns from studying a Patanjali or an Abhinavagupta is also what you learn (after having taken individual cognitive differences into account) by studying these authors. Actually, the cards are stacked in favor of the westerner because his understanding of his native language (say, English) is more profound than your understanding of English. He at least possesses an intuitive psychology that tells him that these concepts are \u0026ldquo;different from and alien to\u0026rdquo; those he is familiar with. In our case, we are deceived: because we can use these words unreflectively (and, in this sense, proficiently) we are deceived into believing that we know what these words mean and what they refer to. We do not.\n5.3. If this is true, and I am convinced that it is, it reveals another layer of what I have been calling the \u0026ldquo;colonial consciousness\u0026rdquo;. We have taken to English the way ducks take to water because we do not know (intuitively) what the words from our own languages mean! This is the reason why the earlier generations of Indians did not object to the translations the English made: we knew neither what \u0026ldquo;Dharma\u0026rdquo; meant nor do we know what \u0026ldquo;normative ethics\u0026rdquo; means. Our understanding of \u0026ldquo;Ishwara\u0026rdquo; is as shallow as our understanding of \u0026ldquo;God\u0026rdquo;.\n5.4. There are many, many, implications to what I am saying. One such that is immediately relevant for our purposes is this: the discussion about whether or not we should retain or translate Sanskrit words into English does not arise from any deep understanding of our culture and traditions but from our ignorance of the same.\nUnlike \u0026lsquo;atom\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;quark\u0026rsquo; (most non-scientists who use these words are also able to explain their non-technical meaning), the words I am talking about refer to our conception of human beings. Do we need to possess them to talk meaningfully about others and think meaningfully about ourselves? 6.1. Consider the possibility that they are entirely technical. In that case, in the absence of knowing what these theories tell us, there is no way we can make sense of these words. In that case, we possess another intuitive model (or theory) of human beings that we use to make sense of ourselves and others. What are some of the concepts from that intuitive model? Given that all the words we use in daily life (without reading these texts) are technical terms, and we do not use other words (which are they?) from our intuitive theories and models about human beings, we do not use our intuitive theories to understand ourselves and others. In that case, our intuitive theories might as well be non-existent. We use words we do not understand; and we do not use the words which we might understand.\n6.2. Consider the second possibility that we do not possess such \u0026ldquo;silent\u0026rdquo; theories about ourselves and the world. Then, the consequences are just the same: we use words that we do not understand in order to make sense of ourselves and other human beings.\nIf I am not a physicist, the translation that \u0026lsquo;atom\u0026rsquo; as the smallest particle of matter (replaced later by \u0026lsquo;quark\u0026rsquo;) will do without disorienting me. However, whatever my profession, I cannot do without words to think about myself, my wife and kids, and other human beings. If I use words that I do not understand, then I end up not understanding myself, my wife and children and my surroundings.\n6.3. Given the fundamental import of these words like buddhi, manas, ahamkara and so on, it is not sufficient that there exists a community of specialists somewhere who can (anyway) only explain what an Abhinavagupta or a Shakara said or meant. Even if they tell me what, say, Manas means in Sanskrit, how do I identify it in myself? Is my desire for a dosa an expression of my manas or buddhi? When I want to rape another woman what prevents me: buddhi, chitta, manas, dharma, or, as Gandhi put it, \u0026ldquo;the conscience\u0026rdquo;? What do I need to change or train if I need to improve? How do I identify that entity? How do I know what trains it? Your experts, it turns out, will have to appeal to the words I already know in order to explain to me what Buddhi or Manas is. But then, what are some of these words that I should already know so that I may understand these experts? Where are they?\nFurther, I need to apply it in my daily life. I need to identify, in my everyday living, whether manas and buddhi are different; whether they are the same; whether I have ahamkara or not and so on.\n6.4. I am not comparing the alleged scientific temperament in the US to our lack of knowledge. I say that your average Joe knows what he means by \u0026rsquo;ego\u0026rsquo; (even if it is not a Freudian conception), what concentration is, and what attention is, what determination is, and what stubbornness is. Well, I am saying that we cannot: all the words we use, and the so-called \u0026ldquo;technical terms\u0026rdquo; are the only ones we know, are those whose meaning is known only to those specialists that you talk about.\nDoes not this situation bother you?\nYou ask: \u0026ldquo;If there is a distinction to be made between how we use words like \u0026lsquo;mind\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;praarabdha\u0026rsquo;, I would welcome any discussion on this point.\u0026rdquo; There is one kind of similarity, viz., lack of clarity. Think of words like \u0026lsquo;culture\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;God\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;Will\u0026rsquo;, etc. They have been called \u0026ldquo;essentially contested concepts\u0026rdquo; in the literature indicating that people have indefinitely many disputes about the meaning of these concepts (that is to say, there is no consensus about the definition of these words). The second similarity is that, by virtue of the absence of such a consensus, its usage in the daily language is itself slippery. You can easily create confusions in the daily conversation about the use of such words. Without fear of controversy, the use of \u0026lsquo;manas\u0026rsquo; (and such like) also share these properties. But there is something more. Even if one does not know what \u0026lsquo;will\u0026rsquo; means, what \u0026lsquo;God\u0026rsquo; means, what \u0026lsquo;mind\u0026rsquo; or its relation to the brain is, and such like, there are institutions and practices that lend meaning to these words: there is the entire apparatus of the judiciary that lends meaning to \u0026lsquo;will\u0026rsquo;; there is the church and religious institutions; there is the talk and structure of human rights\u0026hellip; There are any number of ongoing reflections about the nature of \u0026lsquo;mind\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;brain\u0026rsquo;, the nature of \u0026lsquo;personal identity\u0026rsquo;,\u0026hellip; In sum, there are a whole host of practices current in the western culture of today that give some or another kind of \u0026rsquo;technical meaning\u0026rsquo; to these words and these meanings percolate downwards into the society through a number of structures like media, schools, and so on. This is absent in India..\nTo explain the difference further requires research. In what way, for instance, is a book on Abhinavagupta (that about 10 people might read) different from book about a dualistic theory about mind and the brain (which is, perhaps, read by 100 people)? Answering this question is a part of the research. All I can do is draw attention to the sensed difference and embed feeling this in a hypothesis that is capable of further development. But it is, as yet, not possible to convince that this is indeed the case. What if someone says that there is no difference between India and the west in this case? I have no arguments to convince a skeptic at this moment.\nThe same answer applies here as well: \u0026ldquo;It would be good to outline what needs to happen in our reflections to make progress beyond that.\u0026rdquo; We need to do research. The research itself can be conducted on different levels. For instance, one could begin to identify the cluster of terms, where we confront this difficulty. For instance, we have no such problem when talking about the \u0026lsquo;stone\u0026rsquo; or the \u0026lsquo;cow\u0026rsquo;. We face it, I think, when we talk about human beings. Is it the case that in some aspects this problem is more severe than in other aspects even when we talk about human beings? This is an important way of circumscribing the problem. We can, for instance, start reflecting about how we teach language to a baby: are we concerned about teaching the meaning of words, or do we focus on something else? One could also look in another direction: when we read texts (say the Gita or the Mahabharata), what do we focus upon? Finding out the meaning of some or another word (\u0026lsquo;Dharma\u0026rsquo; for instance) or do we read it with some other goal or purpose? What is it? How does this goal or purpose indifferent (in some what, which way?) to the meaning of words? And so on. In other words, here as elsewhere, only research can answer the questions we raise.\n","tags":[],"title":"Colonial Consciousness and Sanskrit Concepts","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/colonial-consciousness-and-sanskrit-concepts/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","basics","colonial consciousness","translation"],"content":"I do not have a theory of meaning. I do not know which of the many fragmentary theories of meaning I should choose from and why. Even though I acknowledge the importance of the topic, I do not feel called upon to do research on it. So far, I have been able to steer clear of the topic in an interesting way: I am able to show that what appears as translation problem or a meaning problem (how should Sanskrit words be translated or the definition of \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo;, etc) is, at least in some instances, actually not that kind of a problem at all. Such an attitude has generated a psychological bonus for me: I do not go around criticizing Jeffrey Kripal for not knowing Bengali well enough, or for Wendy Doniger for not realizing that Dharma is not religion or that Brahmins are not priests, when my knowledge of either Bengali or Sanskrit does not match up to what they know.\nSuch an attitude also provides a cognitive bonus for my research. I would like to develop a hypothesis (which I have also been developing) why the western culture finds it obvious to translate \u0026lsquo;Brahmins\u0026rsquo; as \u0026lsquo;priests\u0026rsquo;. This research is taking me into the histories of Judaism, the early Christianity, and the western understanding of religions in Egypt and elsewhere, and the Protestant revolution. Such a hypothesis allows me to discuss the issues in India with Indians about the so-called supremacy of the Brahmins, the caste system, the criticisms of the so-called Dalits and so on. It raises further issues too about why Indian intellectuals (whether a Nehru or an Ambedkar) took over such \u0026rsquo;translations\u0026rsquo; and what that situation tells us about what I have begun to call \u0026ldquo;colonial consciousness\u0026rdquo;.\nIn other words, the so-called mistakes (or \u0026lsquo;stupidities\u0026rsquo;) of the western scholars provide me with questions for research because I do not \u0026rsquo;explain\u0026rsquo; their errors in terms of their lack of \u0026lsquo;mastery\u0026rsquo; of the Indian languages. I do not do this because of certain rules of thumb I have been using for some time (in the beginning, implicitly; and now, explicitly). (A) I do not want to commit the symmetrical mistake of writing the western intellectuals off as idiots and imbeciles (this is what they did with respect to India); (B) The hypothesis about a culture being populated only by idiots is implausible as far as I am concerned; (C) If many intelligent people commit the same kind of mistake, I believe, then there is a genuine issue somewhere; and so on. I try to instill this attitude in my students because it has been both psychologically and cognitively enormously productive for me.

The latter, for his part, takes such statements as true descriptions of himself. What is involved is not the authority of the explainer (the colonizer) but the truth-value of the statements. How do we know this to be the case? Because we continue to think such statements are true even after \u0026lsquo;direct\u0026rsquo; colonization has ended.\nConsider the following set statements:\nIndians are dishonest and lazy. Indians are immoral. There is religious conflict in India between the Hindus and the Muslims. There is communal strife in India. India is a corrupt country. Bribes are rampant in the Indian society. Untouchability ought to be abolished. Caste system is a curse on the Indian society. The Harijans in India are exploited by the high-caste Hindus. Many social reformers like Ambedkar, Periyar, Phule, etc. criticized the immoral nature of the Indian caste system. This is a random selection from the common sense of the Indian intelligentsia.

Perhaps the best known members of the Prarthana Samaj were Mahadev Govind Ranada and Narayan Chandavarkar (the Vice-Chancellor of Bombay University). Both reformers advocated what they literally called Hindu Protestantism. Below, I will present what I believe to be illustrations of the distortion that occurs when these intellectuals talk about reform.\nAs advocates of Hindu Protestantism they argued that the old religion was a good religion but it had to adjust itself to the requirements of the modern times. At variance with Europeans who argued that their tradition embodied the Word of God, some intellectuals continued to claim that the Hindu-religion — like any other religion, they said — was man-made. The Hindus, therefore, had every right to change it according to their present needs. This claim was often accompanied by arguments in favor of rewriting the Indian scriptures.\nTo give another example, Hindu Protestantism also meant that they would work — quote Chandavarkar (1893) — \u0026ldquo;with the fresh materials which Christianity has supplied to it.\u0026rdquo; In other words, Hindu Protestantism meant to expose the Indian religion to the positive influences and truth claims of Christianity. After all, and as Chandavarkar saw it, Christ had been a bhakti too. Hindu Protestantism meant that the Indians had to study other religions in order to correct the negative aspects of their own religion.\nThough not exactly related to reform, this might be another interesting example of the distortion. In a speech on what he called the Hindu religion (1902), the so-called conservative thinker, Bal Gangadhar Tilak, claimed that the Vedas were Revelation. However, he did not refer to the Word of God, yet argued that they were Revelation for the obvious reason that \u0026ldquo;they were handed down generation to generation from pre-glacious times.\u0026rdquo;\nDid the Europeans see the distortion? I am not sure about this but I can direct you to some interesting comments in the Dnyanodaya, the most important Anglo-Marathi missionary periodical in Western India. Though they do not formulate it the way Balu formulates it (that Indians distort a concept to the extent that it makes sense to them)— of course— these missionaries very well knew there was something suspicious going on. This is one example: The Lokahitavadi (a Well-Wisher of the People) published many letters in the Bombay newspapers. (In case you have Marathi, his Satapatre (A Hundred Letters) must be very interesting to read.) His real name was Gopal Hari Deshmuk, the founder of the Arya Samaj Bombay. In a letter which was reprinted in the Dnyanodaya, the Lokahitavadi had argued for reform in the same way as in the examples in the above. This is how the missionaries replied:\n\u0026ldquo;Hinduism cannot be reformed, as now professed, and retains any binding authority as a Divine Revelations. The proposal is not to reject modern corruptions and to go back to the religion of the Purans, or the Vedas, or any other professedly sacred books. No; our Reformers have little veneration for the gods or tapasvis of the Purans, and little heart to defend their abominations. And the elemental worship of the Vedas has for them little, if any stronger attractions. To go back to Hinduism as it has existed at any one period would be to them no reform, but the contrary. They cannot go back to the Vedas; they cannot go back to the Purans; they cannot receive any class of Hindu sacred books as worthy of confidence. And yet they do not pretend that the Vedas have been corrupted and changed; neither do they complain of changes in the Purans. Those sacred books however are found to contain much that is unworthy of credit, and it is therefore proposed to reform Hinduism by reforming its sacred books to suit the exigencies of the times! This however would be not a reform but a subverting of Hinduism\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We are told that Christianity became corrupt and was reformed in the sixteenth century, and that this shows the plan now proposed to be feasible. But how utterly different was that reformation! It consisted not in reforming the Scriptures to suit the tastes of the Reformers, but in casting away all human inventions and returning to the Bible as it was. The Bible was not reformed. On the contrary, its authority was vindicated. It was received as a Divine Revelation - the only and sufficient rule of faith and practice. The Reformers of the sixteenth century did not set themselves above the Bible: on the contrary they appealed to it as the authority for all they did. They had no Reformed Shastra, and they would have looked upon a proposal to prepare one, as gross, heaven-daring impiety. How different from this is the proposed reformation of Hinduism.\u0026rdquo; (Dnyanoday, August 15, 1849)\n","tags":[],"title":"How Indian reformers understood Protestant Reformation?","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/how-indian-intellectuals-understood-protestant-reformation/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","Indian traditions"],"content":"What Aristotle is doing in my piece on the Indian traditions?

This situation should already indicate the distance between what is called an \u0026rsquo;ethical enquiry\u0026rsquo; today, and what Aristotle thought was the subject of all such enquiries. But that is not the focus of this piece now. However, there is no need to confuse matters by continually drawing the distinction between \u0026lsquo;modern\u0026rsquo; ethics and \u0026lsquo;Aristotelian\u0026rsquo; ethics. So, let us follow the contemporary consensus and call the quest of our middle-aged man \u0026lsquo;spiritual\u0026rsquo; (from now on without scare quotes). Seeking spirituality, and not having found it in those objects that he once so passionately pursued, he is now raising a spiritual question: in fact, he is undergoing a spiritual crisis.\u0026rdquo;\nThat is to say, ethics IS about the pursuit of happiness, both according to Aristotle and the Indian traditions.

The point is this: based on what we know about human psychology, the nature of happiness, and so on, such people will not be happy. What if some rapist insists that he is \u0026lsquo;happy\u0026rsquo; in raping women? In such a context, the Indian traditions fall silent. When we say that pain pains but we come across someone who insists that infliction of pain upon himself is the summum of pleasure, what are you supposed to conclude?\n","tags":["Aristotle"],"title":"What is ethical about pursuit of happiness (Ananda)","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/what-is-ethical-about-pursuit-of-happiness-ananda/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","criticism"],"content":"If we want to speak about the meaning of human existence, at least one condition has to be met: such an existence (from birth to death at least) must embody a plan or a reason. Such a plan or reason cannot be that of the individual in question for the simple reason that his/her birth (at the least, not to speak of the first years of his/her existence) does not instantiate any of his/her plans. Only in such cases could we say that the human existence has meaning.\nIn the Indian traditions, I have not found any group of people or texts speaking in such terms. Even those who speak of a creator, speak of creation as a \u0026rsquo;lila\u0026rsquo; not as expressions of the plans or reasons of the creator. In the Semitic religions by contrast, the entire Universe exhibits the plan and order that God intends and wills.\nYou ask : \u0026ldquo;How can you ask a question about something as profound as the meaning of human existence and then impose your restrictions on what characteristics the answer \u0026ldquo;must\u0026rdquo; have based on the Semitic thought process?\u0026rdquo; Let me begin my response by saying that I am not basing myself on \u0026ldquo;the Semitic thought process\u0026rdquo; in order to specify the restrictions imposed on meaning questions or their answers. Instead, I base myself on what we (as human beings) know today about answers to meaning questions.\nAll meaning questions are about a why', where the why\u0026rsquo; picks out a reason for an action, an event, or a state of affairs. That is to say, for example, the meaning of my answering your question (why I answer your question instead of, say, keeping quiet) depends on the reasons I have for answering your question. Whether profound or trivial, all meaning questions require an answer that explains why an action was performed, or an event occurred or a state of affairs came about. We quite simply do not know any other kind of an answer to a `why\u0026rsquo; question that enquires after a reason.\nThe meaning of human existence, in so far as we construe it as a why' question, asks: why do we exist? One obvious answer is to refer to the procreative acts of the parents but this answer does not tell us about the meaning of our existence. The other is to talk about the reasons for our existence, that is, specify why we are put\u0026rsquo; on earth. (Even the talk about Karma and reincarnations does not satisfy the requirements of the question that enquires after the `reasons\u0026rsquo; for our existence.) I suggest that this is not considered a well-formed question in the Indian traditions.\nYou chide me for suggesting that the Indian traditions do not ask questions about human existence! Unwarranted, it appears to me: of course, we do ask questions about human existence; I merely say that the Indian traditions do not ask \u0026ldquo;meaning questions\u0026rdquo; about human existence.\nYou say: \u0026ldquo;the \u0026ldquo;meaning of human existence\u0026rdquo; is deduced according to one\u0026rsquo;s understanding of reality, both directly perceived and inferred.\u0026rdquo;\nQuite obviously, we understand the following two terms differently: deduction' and meaning\u0026rsquo;. In the sense I have explained above (and more exhaustively in my book), we can never deduce the meaning of an event, action or a state of affairs unambiguously: there are multiple such accounts possible because different reasons could embody one and the same action, event or a state of affairs.\nIt appears to me that you are using the phrase meaning of human existence' in a different sense: the meaning of an action, event or a state of affairs is its true\u0026rsquo; nature. Perhaps, in this sense, you want to \u0026ldquo;maintain that the Indian traditions are at their core profoundly concerned with the meaning of human existence.\u0026rdquo; While something could be said in favor of this stance, which wants to recast discussions about the nature of human existence and its meaning, more requires doing than has been done so far: we need to develop a robust notion of truth' as something that refers to existence or reality (and not to linguistic statements), some understanding of true\u0026rsquo; explanation that corresponds to this notion of truth, and some understanding of the questions that these explanations seek to answer. We are far, very far, from being able to do any of these things today.\n","tags":[],"title":"Existential Questions","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/existential-questions/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","normative"],"content":" In \u0026ldquo;An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals\u0026rdquo;, David Hume, the philosopher of the Scottish Enlightenment, raises a question, which has always been one of the basic concerns of ethical investigations in the modern western intellectual tradition: what theory of morals could serve any useful purpose, he asks, unless it can be shown that all the duties it recommends are also in the true interest of each individual? Even though there are several interesting things about this question, I will just indicate two of them. Firstly, the belief is that an individual requires reasons to behave morally which is what a theory of morals is supposed to provide. Secondly, he requires reasons to be moral because moral rules constrain his actions. Since it is rational that each individual pursues his \u0026lsquo;own\u0026rsquo; interests, any constraint placed on his behavior requires some kind of justification. Together, these two assumptions yield us the better-known question in ethical theorizing: is it rational to be moral? Or, more imply put in terms of an even older question: why ought we to be moral? Ever since the German Romantics, another thought, which reverses the above question, is also a part of the modern-day consciousness: is it moral to be rational? However, the elaboration of this question is not only implicit but it is also confined mostly to a criticism of local rationalities: the economic rationality, the technological rationality, the scientific rationality, the rationality of progress, etc. The reversal is only implicit and the criticisms only local because even where some person formulates criticisms of (some such) rationality in some domain or the other, there the same individual chooses to be rational in other fields of human endeavor. Of course, there is nothing wrong with this attitude: we are rightly afraid of obscurantist rejections of rationality. However, the problems are these: of what kind of rationality ought we to be critical? That is to say, when are we morally obliged to criticize rationality? What kind of rationality is susceptible to such a moral criticism?\nIf you look at these two paragraphs a bit carefully and think about both kinds of problems, you notice two things: (a) rationality is a value and (b) morality is defended rationally. That is to say, they appear to be so interwoven together that X\u0026rsquo;s solution(it is immoral to be rational whenever \u0026lsquo;moral certainty\u0026rsquo; conflicts with rationality, which is always hypothetical!) does not quite help us. To \u0026lsquo;say\u0026rsquo; what the moral certainty is we need to formulate it in rational terms. Any such formulation(again in X\u0026rsquo;s terms) is hypothetical. That is one of the reasons why attempts to provide a different kind of \u0026lsquo;certainty\u0026rsquo; to morality (for instance, \u0026lsquo;intuitionism\u0026rsquo; in moral theorizing) have failed. When people have different moral judgments about the same problem (abortion, homosexuality, etc are the obvious examples), they all feel equally \u0026lsquo;certain\u0026rsquo; about their judgments. So, how do we solve such moral disagreements? Here, it appears, we need reason. This, however, is a familiar situation. Consider now the situation that we sketch in our article on Dialogue and violence. Here, we show how a reasonable attempt to resolve differences through a rational dialogue generates, feeds and sustains violence. I am inclined to think that there is a very important and fundamental \u0026rsquo;theorem\u0026rsquo; lurking somewhere in the vicinity of this article, even though I have so far failed to formulate it at the required level of generality. There are many results that surprise me in this article. Let me notice just two: (a) the requirements of reason conflict with the requirements of morality; (b) the requirements of reason pervert the cause of justice. (There are more, but they are not necessary for this post.) I have failed to discover inconsistencies in this article so far; equally, I have failed to identify the premises that lead me to these and allied conclusions. [ For more, check the 7th chapter in Reconceptualizing India Studies]\nIn the course of working on the above article, I began to think that \u0026lsquo;justice\u0026rsquo; does not belong to the ethical domain. (Our Indian intuitions allow for a king to be to be both cruel and just or be both immoral and just.) At the same time, what we consider as ethics (the non-normative variety) takes human well-being as the goal and defines ethical thinking as the process of reflection about what this is and how to achieve it. (This is what ethics is to Aristotle as well: help people reach eudaimonia.) Now, here comes Siegfried and postulates that \u0026lsquo;Justice\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;Eudaimonia\u0026rsquo; can be used to define the \u0026lsquo;political right\u0026rsquo; and the \u0026lsquo;political left\u0026rsquo;. In western political thought, Justice is fundamentally \u0026rsquo;normative\u0026rsquo; and is indissolubly a part of the ethical domain. Equally, the \u0026rsquo;left\u0026rsquo; has become synonymous with wanting to \u0026lsquo;build a just society\u0026rsquo;. I have begun to think that there is something very wrong here because, I begin to believe that a \u0026lsquo;just\u0026rsquo; society (or a \u0026lsquo;just\u0026rsquo; principle) can be immoral. I think we can say this without the fear of saying something that is a contradiction in terms. Siegfried, coming from another direction, appears to suggest something similar. So, I am keen on knowing why he says this. If he can elaborate on his proposal, it might throw some new light on a topic that urgently requires to be illumined (as far as I am concerned). ","tags":[],"title":"Does Justice belong to ethical domain?","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/does-justice-belong-to-ethical-domain/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","corruption","normative"],"content":"While translating Russell L. Ackoff, you say that such a translation is \u0026ldquo;not a moral judgment now, but a statement about the state of the economy\u0026rdquo;. But your claim, according to Ackoff\u0026rsquo;s own argument, is untrue.\nConsider how he describes corruption: \u0026ldquo;We concluded that corruption occurs when one party, A (for example, a policeman), who has an obligation to a second party, B (for example, the government), to provide service to a third party, C (for example, a member of the public), serves C in such a way as to benefit A more than he or she is supposed to. In addition, anyone who induces another to behave corruptly is corrupt. Therefore, corruption is the exploitation for one\u0026rsquo;s personal benefit of a position in which one is expected to serve others.\u0026rdquo; B (the policeman) has an obligation to serve C (a member of the public) and this obligation is a moral obligation; A has a derived moral obligation to serve C because A is under the moral obligation to do what B (the government) expects him to. A violates his moral obligation to B because as a part of B, he serves C in such a way that A benefits more, that is, A\u0026rsquo;s (moral) abuse of his position makes him receive more benefits than he morally deserves. (What A deserves by virtue is serving C is a moral reward.) In this sense, Ackoff is making a moral claim.\nAckoff does not consider his description merely as an economic judgment. As he himself says, \u0026ldquo;the immorality of corruption is not nearly as bothersome to me as is its obstructiveness to development.\u0026rdquo; He is not bothered by the \u0026lsquo;immorality\u0026rsquo; of corruption even though it bothers him that it obstructs development.\nWhich development? Probably economic development. Why should this bother him? Because, probably, he finds it ethically good that there is economic development. So, corruption is immoral in an additional way: it prevents the ethically good (because it is ethically desirable) from taking place. So, his judgment is not factual but deeply normative.\nAckoff does not deny (apparently) that \u0026lsquo;development\u0026rsquo; also has an \u0026rsquo;ethical-moral\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;aesthetic\u0026rsquo; dimension, both being normative, when he says that the \u0026lsquo;continuous pursuit of development\u0026rsquo; expresses these aspects. Or even he speaks about \u0026ldquo;legitimate\u0026rdquo; needs and desires: what is \u0026rsquo;legitimate\u0026rsquo; is, of course, something that is not merely \u0026rsquo;legal\u0026rsquo; (a legally enacted measure could be judged illegitimate) but also \u0026rsquo;ethically defensible\u0026rsquo;: curtailing the freedom of press, even if done legally, could be considered illegitimate by appealing to the notions of freedom or to the charter on human rights. That is, ethical considerations are used to speak of legitimacy or illegitimacy.\nAckoff\u0026rsquo;s notion of \u0026lsquo;power-to\u0026rsquo; and the way he speaks out the legitimate needs and desires of others circumscribing limits of one\u0026rsquo;s own desires and needs is not new: for centuries, philosophies of Law have been discussing the notion of \u0026lsquo;rights\u0026rsquo; in a similar fashion. Because they have gone much further than the anecdotal account that Ackoff gives, there is no lesson here, I am afraid. The same also applies to his distinction between the meaning of \u0026lsquo;growth\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;development\u0026rsquo;: indeed, one can distinguish between these two meanings in certain contexts by giving different definitions of these words. For example, the \u0026lsquo;growth\u0026rsquo; of cancer can either be defined as a stage in the \u0026lsquo;development\u0026rsquo; of cancer or as something distinct from the \u0026lsquo;development\u0026rsquo; of cancer or as something co-extensive with the \u0026lsquo;development\u0026rsquo; of cancer. So, what point is being made?\nWhen he says the \u0026lsquo;immorality\u0026rsquo; of corruption does not bother him, he probably has something like the following picture in mind. If something is immoral then it is because some or another act violates some or another moral rule. However, not all need to subscribe to one and the same set of moral rules. It is easily conceivable that one has a set of moral rules where it is \u0026lsquo;good\u0026rsquo; to be immoral. (This is his meta-understanding of morality.) So, he says, he is not bothered by that. In the subsequent phase of the argument, he introduces a part of his own moral notions and simply assumes that it is either \u0026lsquo;factual\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;universal\u0026rsquo;, the latter in the sense that \u0026lsquo;it ought to universally hold\u0026rsquo;. What to universally hold is that \u0026lsquo;development\u0026rsquo; is morally good and morally desirable and that everyone ought to find \u0026lsquo;development\u0026rsquo; good. That is because the notion of \u0026lsquo;development\u0026rsquo; itself is a part of moral vocabulary: one ought to prefer \u0026lsquo;development\u0026rsquo; to \u0026lsquo;underdevelopment\u0026rsquo;.\nHe is familiar with his way of talking and assumes that such a familiarity makes it factual because it does not seem to be formulated (in his mind and explicitly) as a set of explicit moral rules: neither the Bible nor the Torah says \u0026lsquo;you ought to develop\u0026rsquo;. His naiveté does not, of course, transform his claim into factual ones. (Here, he works at an object-level and believes that just because he has a meta-position on morality, he is now free of all moral considerations.)\nIf you suggest that one can define the word \u0026lsquo;corruption\u0026rsquo; in a non-normative way, I agree with you: one can define a word any way one feels like. I never dispute definitions. (There exist many such definitions of corruption in the literature. The idea that corruption is a hindrance to development is also very old: Gunnar Myrdal wrote volumes on this issue in his \u0026lsquo;The Asian Drama\u0026rsquo; in the sixties. Since then, many have attempted to define \u0026lsquo;development\u0026rsquo; itself in non-normative terms and describe corruption as a process that hinders \u0026lsquo;development\u0026rsquo; defined non-normatively. Some have also argued just the opposite based on the same grounds as an efficient way of distributing scarce resources. For literature on corruption, see my article on \u0026lsquo;colonialism and colonial consciousness\u0026rsquo;. ) However, this was not the issue at stake in the discussions on the Sulekha board. The issue was the presence of normative dimensions in our judgments about corruption in India.\nIf one wants to develop the story about corruption either by using a criterion of failure or by having an analogy akin to the corrosion of bridges or as a systemic failure (based, in some way, on the engineering of societies and organizations), etc one has to do more than provide a stipulative definition of corruption: one has to have a theory of how societies function on the basis of which one could then develop some or another factual standard or criterion. At the moment, no one in the world has such a theory. Thus, the discussion is either about definitions, which is uninteresting as far as I am concerned, or about making sense of our language-use, which is normative in nature.\n","tags":[],"title":"What is normative about Corruption being a hindrance to development?","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/what-is-normative-about-corruption-being-a-hindrance-to-development/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","caste","colonial consciousness","law","normative","petitio principii","interests"],"content":" I was invited by some Sadhus from Swami Narayan Temple (BAPS) to visit the temple and have a discussion with them. Because they practice very strict Brahmacharya (eight types of avoiding women, each correlated to an organ: it is called Ashtanga Brahmacharya), the Sadhus said that women could not be present during our discussions, while they were welcome to visit the temple. As I remember the incident, my female students were a bit \u0026lsquo;upset\u0026rsquo; (hurt, insulted, indignant, or whatever) that the Sadhus were not able to meet them and felt discriminated against by virtue of their sex. A few years later, one of my teachers from Belgium visited another wing of the Swami Narayan people and found that \u0026lsquo;women were discriminated against\u0026rsquo; because they were allowed only to come some distance from the temple when the Sadhus were present. In both cases, I was puzzled by their reaction: I explained that the action of the Sadhus should not be seen as an act of discrimination against women but as an expression of the strict Brahmacharya that the Sadhus practiced. The question here is: why did these people (my students and my teacher) experience \u0026lsquo;discrimination\u0026rsquo;, where I saw none and also knew that none was intended?\nI had an occasion to read some pages of a book together with a few people in India. The book is \u0026lsquo;The Language of the Gods in the World of Men\u0026rsquo; by Sheldon Pollock: it is about \u0026lsquo;Medieval\u0026rsquo; India, the role of Sanskrit and many other things about the Indian culture. He talks about the role of Sanskrit in Ancient India in these terms: because Sanskrit was used primarily in the context of rituals during its early days, says Pollock, its role was both limited and exclusive. It was limited in the sense that it was used primarily in \u0026lsquo;Vaidika\u0026rsquo; practices and exclusive in the sense that only a few could speak Sanskrit, while the most were \u0026lsquo;forbidden\u0026rsquo; from using it. Of course, there is no shred of evidence that \u0026lsquo;people\u0026rsquo; were forbidden from using Sanskrit for other purposes or that other groups (than the four varnas) were \u0026lsquo;forbidden\u0026rsquo; from learning Sanskrit, even though one can reasonably assume that most groups did not speak or understand Sanskrit. This \u0026lsquo;sacerdotal isolation\u0026rsquo; (his words) of Sanskrit, says Pollock, indicated both its limited and exclusive nature. He believes that this expressed inequality and discrimination in Ancient India. There is a puzzle here. How does Pollock \u0026lsquo;know\u0026rsquo; that there was discrimination, when there is absolutely no evidence for it? Consider the language I speak at home: Sankethi. Only those born into Sankethi community learn this language and one does not \u0026rsquo;teach\u0026rsquo; this language to other people. Does it follow from this consideration that, therefore, there is discrimination against other peoples and groups in India? In fact, most people in India have not heard of Sankethi and see no reason to learn this language at all. So, if a particular group develops a language for some purpose or another and does not \u0026rsquo;teach\u0026rsquo; it to all the people in the world, does it mean one discriminates? Why cannot one develop a language (like Sankethi was developed) only for use within a restricted number of people? What is discriminatory about it? The only possible way to speak of discrimination, in this case, is if one assumes that languages \u0026lsquo;ought\u0026rsquo; to be universally accessible and that one \u0026lsquo;ought\u0026rsquo; to teach everyone every possible language.\nCommon to both these examples is their \u0026rsquo;normative\u0026rsquo; assumption. The first assumes that the Sadhus ought to be accessible to all people and that, if they are not that, they are discriminating. The temple ought not only be accessible to all (the Swami Narayan temple is accessible to all) but that it also \u0026lsquo;ought\u0026rsquo; to be so at all times and in all circumstances. Any restriction is a case of discrimination. Equally, in the second example, every language \u0026lsquo;ought\u0026rsquo; to be accessible to all people at all times and in all circumstances. (Think about this issue when children devise \u0026lsquo;codes\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;secret languages\u0026rsquo; to communicate only with close friends.) More generally put, everything ought to be accessible to all people at all times and in all circumstances. Such a normative assumption is ridiculous, of course: no one claims that my wife or my house should be accessible to all people in all circumstances and at all times. (In such cases, the scope gets restricted in an ad hoc fashion: every one \u0026lsquo;ought\u0026rsquo; to be able to have a wife or have a house. What about homosexuals or those who prefer tents on a beach? Again, an ad hoc restriction comes into existence and the discussion shifts to other levels.) In other words, the notion of \u0026lsquo;discrimination\u0026rsquo; is very plastic and it is used (as it suits the prejudices of individuals) as one likes it.\nConsider now one aspect of such caste discrimination: marriage among \u0026lsquo;savarnas\u0026rsquo; or the issue of inter-caste marriage. If a Brahmin seeks a Brahmin spouse (and refuses to marry outside the \u0026lsquo;caste\u0026rsquo;), it is said to indicate \u0026lsquo;caste discrimination\u0026rsquo;. What is discriminatory about it? The only possible argument is that the \u0026lsquo;search space\u0026rsquo; has been restricted. The normative claim is that one \u0026lsquo;ought\u0026rsquo; to be ready to search everywhere and that if you search only in one \u0026lsquo;space\u0026rsquo; then you are discriminating other \u0026lsquo;spaces\u0026rsquo;. This is silly: no one can search everywhere at the same time: one can only search in some specific space. Does it mean that because you search in one space you are discriminating against other places? (A problem in scientific research is well-structured if and only if it restricts the search space for the answer: the narrower the search space is, the better is the problem formulation.) So, what is discriminatory about this? Only a normative assumption can do this job: one ought to search everywhere and one ought to marry wherever one finds a possible spouse. (Surely, you cannot get more foolish than this.) What if I want to marry only a Brahmin? What if this is my preference? What is wrong with this? (This normative assumption leads to the denial of personal preferences in marriage and imposes an obligation - an \u0026lsquo;ought\u0026rsquo; - to marry. But if you marry one, you cannot marry all other women. Surely, this is also discrimination?)\nThe point is this: if I want to marry within one community, it does not follow that, therefore, I am discriminating against other communities. If only some people speak some language or another, it does not follow, that, therefore, they are discriminating against all other people. If the Sadhus practice Brahmacharya, it does not follow, therefore, that they are discriminating against women. In each of these cases, one is choosing one option and choice of one option does not discriminate against other choices. Only a totally silly normative assumption can transform a necessary behavior (choosing a particular option) into a discriminatory act. Of course, those who see discrimination in this are also intelligent: they shift grounds to point out well-known (real or imagined) cases of violence: those who marry members from other \u0026lsquo;castes \u0026rsquo; are killed or beaten up or whatever by \u0026lsquo;high caste\u0026rsquo; families. Again, this does not do the job: the violence is heinous, but it is not the case of caste discrimination but one of not following the wishes of the family members. It further also assumes that one \u0026lsquo;ought\u0026rsquo; to be free in the choice of a spouse and that any \u0026lsquo;interference\u0026rsquo; in this (including \u0026lsquo;arranged marriages\u0026rsquo;) are a blemish on the Indian culture.\nAbout hypothetical situations wherein a person is denied a medical treatment or a job opportunity on the ground of his caste.\n6.1. In the first place, I have not heard of people being turned away from a doctor or a hospital in India on grounds of their \u0026lsquo;jati\u0026rsquo;. I have heard of any number of cases in the US (see Moore\u0026rsquo;s brilliant documentary \u0026lsquo;Sicko\u0026rsquo; on the American Health Care System), where people are turned away from hospitals or denied medical treatments because they do not have the \u0026lsquo;right\u0026rsquo; insurance policy. Many have died too because of that. Yet, we do not speak of \u0026lsquo;discrimination\u0026rsquo; (of any kind) in these cases but only of the kind of health care system that the US has. However, we would not hesitate to convict either the Indian culture or \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; of \u0026lsquo;caste discrimination\u0026rsquo;, if any such incident were to occur in India.\n6.2. In the second place, even were we to assume that people are turned away from a hospital or denied medical treatment because of their \u0026lsquo;jati\u0026rsquo;, I am not so sure what makes it into a \u0026lsquo;caste discrimination\u0026rsquo;. If the hospital is established with the explicit goal of helping \u0026rsquo;everyone\u0026rsquo; without any condition whatsoever and the doctor has sworn the Hippocratic oath of helping \u0026rsquo;everyone\u0026rsquo; who asks for his help, then, in such cases, if they then turn away suffering human beings on grounds of their \u0026lsquo;jati\u0026rsquo;, yes, there is a violation. Even here, it is either the hospital or the doctor (or both) who are guilty. However, they are guilty of violating either the stated goal or the sworn oath. This is not so much an \u0026lsquo;instance\u0026rsquo; of caste discrimination as it is of violating the explicit goals and oaths.\n6.3. When a hospital (under some conditions) is meant to treat all the citizens of India and refuses to treat some of them because of other considerations that are non-technical in nature, such a hospital is violating the legal requirements. If these legal requirements are also moral in nature (this requires additional moral assumptions), then, and only then, could we speak of them as also being morally discriminatory.\n6.4. The same consideration applies to job opportunities. If, and only if, a firm or an institution opens up an job with an explicit claim that no other conditions apply for success except, say, academic qualifications and, despite this, chooses less qualified people on grounds of their \u0026lsquo;jati\u0026rsquo; then, yes, there is discrimination on the basis of \u0026lsquo;caste\u0026rsquo;. However, when being born in a jati is considered a sufficient qualification or a college run by, say, a religious institution chooses people on the basis of their religious leanings, what kind of discrimination is involved?\n6.5. Just because someone is denied access to some service or another on the basis of \u0026lsquo;caste\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;race\u0026rsquo;, that alone is not sufficient to transform such an act into a \u0026lsquo;discriminatory\u0026rsquo; act. It becomes that only when the explicitly stated condition allows everyone who satisfies the said condition to have access to that service and, yet, denies someone from accessing that service (even though the condition is satisfied) on some other unstated ground (say, \u0026lsquo;race\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;caste\u0026rsquo;).\nYou find something objectionable to excluding people on grounds of their birth. I would like to suggest that such an exclusion becomes a case of \u0026lsquo;discrimination\u0026rsquo; if, and only if, an additional normative assumption is present. Consider the presence of all kinds of youth hostels in India that cater only to students from specific jati\u0026rsquo;s: Kuruba hostel, gowda hostel, lingayat hostels, and such like. Is this exclusion also a case of discrimination? If these are legitimate, then excluding on the basis of birth alone is not enough to speak of discrimination. You speak of dining practices in some temples and suggest that exclusion on the basis of money and power are less heinous than exclusion on the basis of birth. If we look at it empirically, you will find that it is far more difficult to become rich or powerful (if you born poor or powerless) than it is to gain entry into these dining halls at temples. All one has to do is to wear the \u0026lsquo;sacred thread\u0026rsquo;, claim to be a second generation immigrant from Rajasthan or Bihar or some far-off place and mention some fictitious \u0026lsquo;sub-jati\u0026rsquo; as a brhaminical jati. In other words, all one has to do is wear the thread and tell a lie. Which is easier? Tell a lie or cough up 10,000 Rs, when you are poor? Nothing is easier in India today than change jati\u0026rsquo;s, even at an official level: consider how many people do not obtain false jati-certificates by paying a bribe to concerned officials!\nBefore we start speaking about caste \u0026lsquo;discrimination\u0026rsquo;, it would be wise if we reflect on which normative assumptions are involved in such judgment and whether they are reasonable and defensible. Not every alleged case of \u0026lsquo;caste discrimination\u0026rsquo; is also a case of caste discrimination. Simply reproducing the common sense criticisms of the Indian \u0026lsquo;caste system\u0026rsquo; will not do. Thus, there is much that requires doing before one can come up with a message that political parties can transmit.\nA comment: In particular, the sadhus\u0026rsquo; vows embody a particular attitude towards women, that even seeing them upsets some spiritual balance, which is IMO, rubbish\u0026hellip; Then you go on to draw a parallel between such an attitude and those prevalent in Islamic societies.\n9.1. There are two different issues here. Let us, for a moment, assume that the Brahmacharya of the Sadhus at the Swami Narayan Temple is indeed \u0026lsquo;rubbish\u0026rsquo;. Now, of course, that they have wrong beliefs about women (and Brahmacharya) may be a reason to rubbish their beliefs but not to deny them the freedom to believe in that \u0026lsquo;rubbish\u0026rsquo; and practice it for themselves. There is nothing morally wrong in having wrong or false beliefs. Atheists, for instance, genuinely believe that religion is very dangerous for human beings but that does not mean, therefore, that people should be forbidden from being believers. Those men and women (yes, women too) who are followers of Swami Narayan share the belief of the Sadhus: the women do not protest that they are not allowed to enter the temples when the Sadhus are present. In fact, if they go to the temple when the Sadhus are also at the temple, they wait at some distance; they enter the temple at certain hours of the day when the Sadhus are not \u0026lsquo;allowed\u0026rsquo; to enter the temple. In other words, they do not feel discriminated against.\nThe reason why you and my Belgian students feel discriminated against lies elsewhere, namely, in the normative assumptions they make and not in the beliefs and practices of the Sadhus. This statement becomes obvious when you realize that the men and women who follow this tradition also share beliefs and practices in common and do not protest against discrimination. I have known some wonderful men, who practiced very strict brahmacharya because they were the bhaktas of Anjaneya (or Hanumantha): as you know, Anajaneya is a very great bhkata of Rama and a very strict Brahmachari. Surely, you do not want to say that Anjaneya was an Islamic mullah avant la lettre?\nI remember that Anjaneya had some kind of problem in communicating to (or seeing) Sita because of his practice of Brahmacharya and that some discussion (or consideration) convinced him to be a messenger of Rama. If I am wrong about this, then I am willing to withdraw my point I made using this analogy.\n9.2. Another coment: you want to question the assumptions that the Sadhus make about sexuality and you find them disturbing. I would go easy on using terms like \u0026lsquo;sexuality\u0026rsquo; here because it is being used without much reflection. Consider now the fact that these Sadhus, in contradistinction to the Advaiti Sanyasis, do not ever see their mothers after their initiation. (The advaiti sanyasis, for instance, have no problems in seeing women or prostrating to their mothers from their \u0026lsquo;purvashrams\u0026rsquo;.) Are you willing to suggest that their unwillingness (or inability) to see even their own mothers as an expression of their fear (or distaste or repulsion) of (female) sexuality? Unless you buy into the idea that women always symbolize sexuality to men, I do not see how you can be disturbed. Is one to assume that mothers, sisters, aunts, nieces, daughters and so on (all women, in short) are all and only disguised sexual symbols to Indian men (or men in general)?\n9.3. This problem arises from the idea that \u0026lsquo;brahmacharya\u0026rsquo; is a result of some kind of sexual anxiety and even a fear of adult sexuality. I believe that the Indian traditions form an alternative to Freudian (or neo-Freudian) understanding of human psyche. Of course, you can either poke fun or be critical of, say, Galilean Physics from the perspective of Aristotelian physics or of Darwinian biology from the perspective of Creationism, but that would not do, would it? Of course, I have no idea how to understand Brahmacharya as yet, but I have learnt enough not to use Freud to understand the Indian traditions. In any case, I am not sympathetic to looking at Brahmacharya as some kind of deviation, whether moral or sexual. I consider it a legitimate way of \u0026lsquo;being\u0026rsquo;, one that is every bit as legitimate as any other mode of being-in-the-world (anubhava). I am not a brahmachari, but I do not, because of that, consider those who are that either misguided or as perverts.\n9.4. Let us, for the sake of argument and in a very crude form, assume that Brahmacharya is an expression of a fear of either female sexuality or an anxiety about adult sexuality. However, because such people are present in all cultures and at all times, we have to assume that it is a variety in human evolution. That is to say, we have three kinds of people: heterosexuals, homosexuals and lesbians, and people with anxieties about adult sexuality. The presence of these three groups, in whatever numbers, cuts across cultures and epochs and thus is a \u0026lsquo;quirk\u0026rsquo; of biological evolution. I do not want to take up the issue of their \u0026lsquo;survival value\u0026rsquo; to the population. Instead, let us look at how Indian culture deals with those \u0026lsquo;afflicted\u0026rsquo; with such sexual anxieties.\n9.5. Instead of transforming such people into neurotics in need of medication and psychiatric help, the Indian culture gives them a respected place in society by according a special status to \u0026rsquo;life-long brahmacharis\u0026rsquo;. It recognizes this \u0026lsquo;affliction\u0026rsquo; as something \u0026rsquo;normal\u0026rsquo; (and not label it \u0026rsquo;neurotic\u0026rsquo;) by suggesting that every young male figure (before marriage) is a \u0026lsquo;brahmachari\u0026rsquo; and ties special privileges and status to this phase of human existence. Even if the brahamacharis are \u0026lsquo;handicapped\u0026rsquo; by the fear of adult sexuality, our culture allows them to lead an otherwise \u0026rsquo;normal\u0026rsquo; life and acknowledges their contribution to society. It creates special \u0026lsquo;devas\u0026rsquo; who are brahmacharis, creates institutional practices to accord them a special place and does not discriminate against them because of their \u0026lsquo;sexual anxiety\u0026rsquo;. Contrast this with the attitude prevalent in the western culture, where marriage to someone from the opposite sex is \u0026ldquo;God\u0026rsquo;s commandment to men and women\u0026rdquo;. Even the celibacy of the Catholic Priesthood was a late invention and Protestants found such a vow contrary to God\u0026rsquo;s commandments.\nWhich of the two should we prefer, if, indeed, people with sexual anxieties are a result of human biological evolution?\nEven if these Sadhus are wrong about their ideas and practices, one cannot say, therefore, they are morally wrong. 10.1. Much the same way the women do not come into the temple when the Sadhus are present, the Sadhus are not allowed to come into the temple during certain hours of the day. In this sense, the restrictions boil down to this: women do not enter the temple during certain hours and the Sadhus do not, during certain other hours. Even if the temple is a public space, whatever the word \u0026lsquo;public\u0026rsquo; might mean in this context, I do not see what makes this restriction immoral.\n10.2. About the analogy between women defending burqa and the women in this tradition. My point is that neither those who follow Swami Narayan nor those outside their fold (both men and women) experience the Brahmacharya of these Sadhus as discriminatory. Some, at the most, might criticize the Sadhus for being misogynists (the point you seem to make) but misogyny is a prejudice at best. It becomes \u0026lsquo;immoral\u0026rsquo; only if you add the moral assumption that one \u0026lsquo;ought\u0026rsquo; not to be a misogynist. (However, I do not even subscribe to describing these Sadhus as misogynists but that is irrelevant for the moment.)\nAnother comment: If Atman is reality and the physical body is incidental, then it should not matter whether it is a man or a woman in front of you. Whatever normative assumptions that these three Belgians held, your assumption about the nature of \u0026lsquo;Atman\u0026rsquo; is not normative. At best, assuming that the stories which the Swami Narayan people hold to is the same as what you believed to be the case, you can say that the Sadhus are wrong either with respect to the conclusion they drew (thus, suggest that the Sadhus are logically inconsistent) or with respect to the facts of the matter (about the relation between \u0026lsquo;Atman\u0026rsquo; and \u0026rsquo;the body\u0026rsquo;). Thus, you cannot make the normative criticism that these three Belgians made.\nThe same argument holds with respect to the police. All I want to suggest is that we can view some act as morally discriminatory if, and only if, some or another moral assumption is made in the course of our arguments. Similarly, we need to add moral assumptions whenever we speak of caste discrimination.\nAbout the state, state action and the issue of public interest. There are multiple problems here, which I am only slowly beginning to recognize. I will share two such problems with you without, however, being able to concretely spell out the alternatives.\n13.1. (a) Consider the belief that the state \u0026lsquo;ought\u0026rsquo; to act in the public interest. This belief makes sense if we assume that it is possible to speak in terms of \u0026lsquo;public interest\u0026rsquo; in some non-trivial fashion. Both Kenneth Arrow and Amrtya Sen have proved theorems that show that any such use incoherent: Arrow argued that we cannot speak of \u0026lsquo;public will\u0026rsquo; in any coherent way; Sen argued that we cannot aggregate private preferences into a consistent and coherent set of \u0026lsquo;public preferences\u0026rsquo;. Our notion of \u0026lsquo;public interest\u0026rsquo; includes these two notions and, as a consequence, does not allow of a coherent conceptualization. Even banning smoking in public places (whatever the notion of a \u0026lsquo;public space\u0026rsquo; be) is not very coherent, if argued in terms of \u0026lsquo;public interest\u0026rsquo;. In this sense, justifying complex actions, which carry unintended consequences, in the name of public interest is not an interesting exercise. (b) Despite this, the idea of the state and its relation to public interest preoccupies people because of something else: that is the belief that every institution in society has an \u0026lsquo;interest\u0026rsquo; and the state has a \u0026lsquo;public interest\u0026rsquo;. That is, there is an underlying assumption of \u0026lsquo;intelligibility\u0026rsquo; to claims about \u0026lsquo;institutional interests\u0026rsquo;: each institution has an interest the way each individual has either a \u0026lsquo;desire\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;interest\u0026rsquo;. The more I read history, the less intelligible it has become to me. I believe that this claim is a \u0026lsquo;secular translation\u0026rsquo; of the idea that the Christian Church has some set of interests and political thinking, since the Middle Ages in Europe, has so constantly hammered on this theme that it has become a trivial fact that we take for granted. It is totally unclear to me how we identify the \u0026lsquo;interests\u0026rsquo; of a social institution, the State included, and how we find out whether we are wrong or right in attributing such an \u0026lsquo;interest\u0026rsquo; to a social institution. In other words, we have no clue how we solve our disagreement in this area of legal and political philosophy: the more radical the disagreement, the less clear how we should solve the issue: suppose I deny that the State has any set of interests that it can call its own, how do we solve this disagreement? On the basis of some or another definition about what \u0026lsquo;interest\u0026rsquo; is or what \u0026lsquo;State\u0026rsquo; is?\n13.2. The normativity involved in seeing the State as an entity that \u0026lsquo;ought\u0026rsquo; to act in the public interest, thus, is double; there is the prima facie normativity of the \u0026lsquo;ought\u0026rsquo;; then there is a cloudy area where we do not even know what other assumptions about the state and public interest we entertain when we make claims about institutional interests.\n14. Yet another comment: In another incident, Rajesh and Pinky committed suicide. They were in love, but Rajesh was dalit, Pinky was savarna, and her parents would not consent to a marriage. They died near the railway tracks, having consumed poison. I will repeat my question: forget for the time being \u0026ldquo;religious\u0026rdquo; versus \u0026ldquo;secular\u0026rdquo;. What is it that legitimizes state intervention in something?\nSome responses are in order, if at least to bring out a tacit assumption in these sentences. We all know the story of Romeo and Juliet both of whom died because the feuding families did not consent to their marriage. Should the state intervene between all feuding families because in some cases it leads to tragedies like that of Romeo and Juliet? What, I would like to ask, is the difference between this case and that of Rajesh and Pinky? You might want to say that feud between families is a ‘personal’ or ‘familial’ issue, whereas the caste discrimination is a social one. But this is merely an assumption, which has taken the status of a fact to us. Why cannot one see it as an ‘personal’ or ‘familial’ issue as well, i.e. as an issue that involves the notions of Rajesh’s and Pinky’s parents? Consider the following personal story. My maternal uncle was one of the most rigid and orthodox brahmins I have ever known in my life. His own daughter, my niece, is married to a ‘harijan’ with the blessings of her father; I am married to a Belgian woman (who eats both beef and meat) with no problems raised on my side of the family. What does this anecdote indicate? How ‘tolerant’ my family is? Why can it not illustrate the fact that there are no social rules that all brahmins have to (leave alone Indians) follow? In other words, the tragic story of Pinky and Rajesh is an instance of social injustice, if and only if, one assumes that it is social injustice. Such a reasoning is a fallacy called petitio principii, i.e., assuming as true what one should prove to be true. That the ‘caste system’ in india is causally responsible for the ills in india requires showing, not assuming. Nehruvian socialism assumes this missionary hallucination as a truth about the Indian society.\n","tags":[],"title":"Normative Assumptions, Discriminations, and Caste Discriminations","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/normative-assumptions-discriminations-and-caste-discriminations/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","religion"],"content":"Ideas have impact on people. Theological dilemmas have impact on those who formulate such dilemmas and on the future generations. They undertake actions (of whatever type) to solve these dilemmas, where and when these people find such dilemmas important. In this way, one can make some sense of the claim that Christological dilemma propels Christianity forward. However, this explanation cannot (at the stage our knowledge is in) be incorporated into a historical explanation: was Thomas Aquinas responding to the state of theology during his time, or was he a fame-hungry man who wrote his Summa Theologica in order to become famous, or was he afflicted by a rare disease?.? In other words, if we try to explain why St. Thomas wrote Summa, there are so many possibilities that a selection of any one possibility becomes a matter of taste and of one\u0026rsquo;s pet theory. Moreover, even then, such a selection fails to tell us much about western history. Consequently, such an explanation cannot become a part of historical explanation, if the idea is to make history intelligible and coherent.\nThis applies to scientific theories as well: Why did Newton\u0026rsquo;s theory generate the responses it did? Did Newton\u0026rsquo;s theory generate the problems? How can a theory generate problems? After all, a theory cannot do anything on its own without human beings doing something about these theories. Yet, we routinely speak this way and even write histories of sciences in this fashion. How could we write a history of physics (or any science) without making the problems and their solutions into the agent of the history of sciences? Of course, we add something about human beings to reduce the air of mystification but we cannot use these claims about human beings to explain the history of sciences. (Of course, we still do not know how to write an intelligible and coherent history of sciences, but that is a different issue.)\nOur theories of learning are not in a position to help us here. We simply do not have the theoretical repertoire to even conceptualize the problems. True, we could make the philosophical objection that human beings have to do something and that without them doing something history is impossible. However, this objection, in itself, is not the problem requiring solution. No cognitive theory and no learning theory can tell us much about, say, scientific progress: why there is scientific progress or what it consists of. (Is not the question `does science make progress?\u0026rsquo; itself mystifying?)\nIn other words, I am not convinced that talk of reinforcers and such like will help us in our case. It is not clear whether we need something different in the case of religion when compared to science, philosophy, literature etc. to explain how religion could spread among human beings. If we do, I am not sure reinforcement is what we need to be looking into. To the extent we need something different, here are two possible avenues.\n(a) Religion constrains human thinking in two ways at least. It limits the kind of questions and their possible answers in a way that other accounts (say, scientific or philosophical accounts) do not. It is also an enabling constraint in the sense that it gives structure to human creativity. (Because all human thinking is a situated and limited thinking, creativity makes sense only because of such definiteness.) This locates the spread of religion by speaking about the cognitive aspect.\n(b) Any learning process requires that the organism takes a definite attitude towards its environment. Religion enables the emergence of one such attitude because of its ability to generate a configuration of learning. This locates the spread of religion by speaking about the precondition for learning by looking at the evolutionary aspect.\nI do not think that individual psychology is of much use to us because of the incredible variety of individual psychologies that are `open\u0026rsquo; to religion. I do not think cultural psychology helps because it will be partial and fragmentary. In other words, I think that the spread of religion requires to be localized in the interface between evolutionary psychology and theories of learning on the one hand and cognitive psychology on the other.\n","tags":[],"title":"How religion spreads?

What is it about them that enables the transmission of religion?\nThis issue allows multiple answers. In this post, I would like to focus on the simplest answer to the question. In my theory, I presuppose an answer to the question: I assume that there is something in our constitution that allows religion to spread among human beings. The issue now is: why do I presuppose it, i.e. assume this state of affairs as a fact?\nThe reason is also simple: I do not know how to go about answering this question or even where I have to look for an answer. Let me explain. Should a theory of cultural difference answer this question? Should a theory of religion answer this question? Should evolutionary psychology answer this question? Should individual psychology answer this question? Should evolutionary biology answer this question?\nIf a theory of cultural difference should answer this question, then that is because one can show that the cultural psychological difference between two cultures allow for the expansion of religion In that case, probably the answer will be partial: from where does the difference in cultural psychology emerge?\nShould a theory of religion answer the question? In that case, it is in the nature of religion to create the conditions of the transmission of religion. If a theory in evolutionary psychology answer this question, then that is because it identifies some inherited evolutionary aspects of our psychologies (in all cultures) that allow in some cultures the propagation of religion. (In such a case there is some or another psychological need that can be filled by religion in one case and something else in another case.) If individual psychology were to answer this question, it does so by identifying the characteristic patterns (let us say) of a person that allows for his conversion. If evolutionary biology can answer this question, then it will either be in the direction of cultural psychology, or identify the adaptive property of religion or falsify my hypothesis.\nIn other words, it is unclear which theory should answer this question. At least the above theories are all candidates for answering this question (may be even sociology is one such candidate) Currently, because I have no idea how to answer this question I simply take it as a fact that religion exists among (some) human beings and try to understand its transmission by formulating hypothesis about its dynamic.\nOne of the very typical uncertainties in the course of emergence of a scientific theory is the above kind of ambiguity. For instance, in the early days of theory of electricity, it was unclear whether the twitching of legs of a dead frog when electrical current passed through them should be explained by theories of electricity or through theories in biology. What kind of a phenomenon was this?\nIn the same way, your question, though completely reasonable, carries the same uncertainty. However, all I can say at the moment is that I have no idea where one should look for an answer: in individual psychology, in cultural psychology, in sociology, in evolutionary psychology, in evolutionary biology.\n","tags":[],"title":"What enables religion to spread?","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/what-enables-religion-to-spread/"},{"categories":["concept(category)","Jakob","secular"],"content":"We have developed partial explanations of why the secularism debate in India takes such peculiar forms and why otherwise intelligent people talk nonsense here. But we don\u0026rsquo;t do so by pegging our use of the word secularism \u0026ldquo;onto Balu\u0026rsquo;s theory about the nature of religion and how that entity religion behaves in the world\u0026rdquo; and then expecting that other people do the same.\nLet me quickly repeat our argument: Concepts like religion and secularism and principles of the secular state developed in Europe against the background of larger conceptual frameworks. Broadly speaking, one knew what religion' and 'the secular state' referred to or what the separation of the religious\u0026rsquo; and `the political\u0026rsquo; amounted to, because these terms were embedded in such a common background framework. Naturally, there were many different positions and discontinuities in the debates. But disagreements about the precise meaning of terms or clashes between conflicting normative positions made sense to the participants, precisely because they occurred against the background of this type of framework. The framework put semantic limits on the potential interpretation of terms and principles, as it related concepts to each other in particular systematic ways. This background framework reflects not only generic Christian theology and political theory, but also the common cultural and historical experience of Europeans.\nWhen the relevant terms, concepts and principles migrate from one cultural setting to another, they are detached from this background framework. In that case, the concepts and principles in question will inevitably begin to lose their basic intelligibility and accessibility. This is what happens in the Indian secularism debate: there is no shared background framework that puts semantic limitations on the interpretations of terms and principles and that allows one to make sense of conflicting positions. Consequently, even where participants in this debate adopt the exact formulae of western political thought, these are interpreted in seemingly random ways. This leads to semantic distortion and obscurity.\nIn the kind of work our research group is doing these days, we are taking the argument a step further. The semantic and conceptual distortions (in Indian debates like the secularism debate) do not occur at random, but reveal a particular kind of systematicity. Their systematic nature, we propose, provides a unique access point to the conceptual schemes that lie behind the Indian claims and interpretations of English-language terms. Furthermore, these conceptual schemes derive from the background theories of the Indian traditions that have shaped the reasoning of these people. Tracking such underlying conceptual schemes, then, allows one to characterize certain basic structures of these traditions.\nMetaphorically, it helps to think in terms of two layers: at the surface, we have the layer of confusing claims on \u0026lsquo;secularism\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo;; underneath this lies a more fundamental conceptual layer that we need to dig up. This second layer reflects Indian modes of reasoning about the nature of traditions, the role of reason, the stances and heuristics that allow peaceful co-existence of traditions… To a large extent, the Indian use of English-language terms is mapped onto the semantic schemes of this deeper layer. Simultaneously, Indians adopt typical formulae from Christian theology and western thought. In the surface layer, then, we face a confounding conceptual blend. Nevertheless, it provides our only access to the deeper layer: we identify the structures of this deeper layer by theorizing how they are revealed in the semantic distortions of the surface layer.\nThis approach will allow us to make sense of what Indians are doing when they discuss \u0026lsquo;secularism\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo; in peculiar ways. However, this is very different from the \u0026lsquo;multiple meanings\u0026rsquo; story. That story does something altogether different. It tries to provide a kind of theoretical justification for the situation of conceptual distortion, confusion and obscurity, which has emerged after Indians and other colonized peoples started adopting fragments of western political and social thought. It says: \u0026ldquo;basically it is all right to use words like \u0026lsquo;secularism\u0026rsquo; in all kinds of random ways and talk without knowing what one is talking about, because this is how things should be.\u0026rdquo; That is, this is the ultimate step of postcolonial bankruptcy (which people like Talal Asad and Homi Bhabha are advising us to take): it tells one that the production of conceptual humbug is the norm that we should all follow. This is the best way to assure that the non-western world will not contribute anything to social and political theory. It is to ask of the colonized that they celebrate their state of being colonized ","tags":[],"title":"Bankruptcy of postcolonial intellectuals and their defense of secularism","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/bankruptcy-of-postcolonial-intellectuals-and-their-defense-of-secularism/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","basics","criticism","secularism"],"content":"I want to go deeper into the claim of my earlier post that Shabnum Tejanis and Neera Chandhokes of this world do not think but merely talk. In other words, is it possible to identify the problems with their accounts (that explicates more clearly why I say that they do not think) in such a way that it is susceptible to some sort of solution? If, indeed, we can show that such people do not think and we can show that their mistakes have some cognitive roots, then we can also provide additional explanations. In such a case, our answer would be richer and more complex than any other available at the market place.\nHere is the first charge: they talk about certain domains of human endeavor as though they do have knowledge of these domains, whereas they do not know anything about that domain. I will first explain this charge before talking about the implications. Consider one of the most common argumentative (and cognitive) strategies that many people in the social sciences use, when they want to criticize some position or the other. This consists of challenging the truth of the premises in an argument in order to show that (a) they disagree with the argument; (b) one could legitimately challenge the truth of the conclusions thereby; (c) in doing so, they are advancing knowledge of the subject matter. (This takes many forms and I give you three illustrations out of indefinitely many: Shabnum Tejani does it in the citation that Jakob used in his first post; Achin Vanaik used this in the Rethinking Religion in India conference while he spoke of a \u0026rsquo;logical theory\u0026rsquo; in the domain of International Relations; Will Sweetman uses this in his published article in a journal to say that I am wrong because I presuppose Protestant Christianity as the model of religion to draw the conclusion that Hinduism is not a religion. I suggest you look at all three to discover how wide-spread and familiar this argument is. How often have you not heard people\u0026rsquo;s argument being dismissed on the grounds that one does not agree with their premises or assumptions or presuppositions?) As you can see, people use the following notions: \u0026lsquo;premises and conclusions\u0026rsquo;; \u0026rsquo;truth and derivation\u0026rsquo;; \u0026lsquo;drawing conclusions from certain premises\u0026rsquo;. All of these are studied in Logic and this constitutes the subject matter of formal logics.\nIf you read the first chapter in a book on \u0026lsquo;Introduction to Logic\u0026rsquo; or attend the first class in the first year of a logic course, you learn about these notions. Almost one of the first things you learn is this: there is a fundamental asymmetry in the transmission of truth and falsity from premises to conclusions. Truth is transmitted from premises to conclusions but falsity is not; falsity is transmitted from the conclusion to premises but truth is not. (In both cases, we assume that valid rules of logical inferences are used.) That is to say, if your premises are true and you use valid rules of inference, then your conclusion is also true; if your conclusion is false and you use valid rules of inference then at least one of your premises is false. However, the other way does not hold: you could have false premises and yet draw true conclusions. The falsity of your premise does not make your conclusion false or the truth of your conclusion does not make all your premises (or even one of them) true. This is the nature of drawing conclusions in deductive logics. Because this is the first thing you learn in your logic course, I have also formulated in a simple language.\nSo, when people like Shabnums of this world enter the domain of logic (they are, after all, arguing using notions from formal logics), you expect them to know this. If they do not, they should not argue or criticize. They are not ordinary citizens who are arguing in a café but pretend to be intellectuals who are producing knowledge about the world. In the former case of café discussions, we can overlook logical mistakes; after all, it is the beer that talks. In the latter case, we cannot. These people are public intellectuals and teachers; they form young minds and influence public policies. So, we expect them to know what they are talking about. It is their duty and obligation as well. But they do not know: they think they are being \u0026rsquo;logical\u0026rsquo;, when they commit mistakes that a freshman should not. How fit I am to be a teacher and an intellectual if I talk about matters studied in Physics without knowing anything about Physics? What would my \u0026rsquo;expertise\u0026rsquo; in Physics amount to, when it transpires that I do not know the first lesson in physics?\nInvariably, such tremendous but unforgivable ignorance goes hand-in-hand with contempt for the subject matter of logic. I do not know whether Shabnum has expressed this; but it is implicit in any case. I have heard claims like the following from precisely these kinds of pundits: \u0026lsquo;I do not do logic-chopping\u0026rsquo;; \u0026lsquo;The world does not follow your rules of logic\u0026rsquo;; \u0026lsquo;I totally reject Aristotelian (or bourgeois) logic\u0026rsquo;; \u0026lsquo;what we need is less \u0026lsquo;or-or\u0026rsquo; reasoning but more \u0026lsquo;and-and\u0026rsquo; thinking\u0026rsquo; and so on and so forth. In and of itself I do not mind such death-defying acts; however, I do have problems with the fact that it is sheer ignorance that talks here. Those who talk like this or embody such attitudes are legion; social sciences are full of pompous ignoramuses like these. Here, the problem is this: why is such a dismissive attitude ingrained among social scientists? Answering this question gives us some handle on Chandokes and Shabnums of this world as well.\nTo some extent, this attitude is a part of the contempt for theories. Most social scientists are incapable of producing theories and hypotheses of the required kind. They think that all these domains consist of mere \u0026lsquo;opinions\u0026rsquo; and that one cannot produce knowledge about human beings, cultures and societies. Consequently, any opinion is as good as any other opinion: after all, everyone of us knows what \u0026lsquo;culture\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;politics\u0026rsquo; etc are all about. So, what matters what one says? This attitude to knowledge, which characterizes post- world war social sciences (especially under the influence of the US), is also shared by Shabnum. To understand this wide-spread dismissal of the importance of theory and the possibility of producing knowledge would also enable us to understand the Chandokes and Sahbnums of this world.\nAnd then, there is also an equally abysmal ignorance about theories of meaning, reference and language. Yet, this does not deter them talking about \u0026lsquo;meaning\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;historical contexts\u0026rsquo;, \u0026rsquo;language and society\u0026rsquo; and such like. The number of times I have heard intellectuals saying, \u0026lsquo;I totally reject Aristotelian notion of truth\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;I reject the correspondence theory of language\u0026rsquo; is indefinitely many. Of course, these people did not know what they were talking about in each of these cases. So, this way of \u0026lsquo;rejecting\u0026rsquo; all kinds of things they know nothing about characterizes Shabnums of this world as well. Here too, my objections are the same. In an increasing fashion, it appears as though the only (and supreme) qualification to become an intellectual and social scientist seems to be ignorance and not knowledge. We need to understand this process as well.\nSo, I could go on, but I will stop here. When I say, therefore, they talk but do not think, I am not explaining why they say what they say: I am merely characterizing what is it that they do. Let us first find out what they do, before we explain.\n","tags":["Will Sweetman"],"title":"Why Indian Secularists do not think but talk?","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/why-indian-secularists-do-not-think-but-talk/"},{"categories":["Jakob"],"content":"We do not have any clear explanation of the nature and rise of American identity politics as yet. But here are a few speculative intuitions:\nIdentity politics seems to be the way in which the dominant culture in America compels other cultural communities to become variants of itself. It sustains a basic model of society which neutralizes groups that challenge the dominant culture by making them into cultural ghettos. As such, these groups can demand recognition of their distinct identity and fight for a just representation in education. But they can do so only within the conceptual limits fixed by the dominant culture. In this way, the other cultural communities are straitjacketed into the basic cultural structure of American society. This basic structure somehow reflects the mechanisms through which Christianity has always transformed the nonwestern cultures into variants of itself. As such, American society and its identity politics are secularized Christianity embodied in a socio-political model.\nHistorically, this can be seen in the process through which American pluralism has come into being. At its beginnings, American society consisted of a variety of Protestant denominations, many of which had fled Europe as persecuted heretics. Both the variety of these Protestant groups and their experience of being persecuted by a dominant Protestant church-state gave rise to a distinct model of society. In everyday life, each group was free to practice its particular variant of Christian worship and proclaim its specific version of Christian doctrine and morality. The groups could even do so with a certain fanaticism and radicalism, as is illustrated by the Quaker, Amish and Mennonite communities. In the sphere of public debate, they could defend their own moral convictions and sacrosanct opinions (one instrument through which they could do so was the natural rights discourse). But when it came to politics, law and the state, these domains ought to be neutral towards all the different Protestant churches. That is, the central authority should be a broadly Protestant state free from any sectarian affiliations. Thus, the basic structure of society consisted of an overlapping secularized Protestant framework, which accommodated and arranged the variety of distinct Protestant sub-churches and their doctrines. From the time of Jefferson onwards, this model established itself as the ideal of the American nation-state.\nFrom early on in American history, there were groups who did not fit in well in this overlapping Protestant consensus model: the Irish and Italian Catholics; the Native Americans; the African (ex-)slaves. Accordingly as it gained socio-economic and political power or became a threat of some kind, each of these groups could ask for recognition of its separate cultural identity and demand its own space in the American nation-state. However, the basic structure remained in place and the kind of niche it could give to these different cultural communities was that of a Protestant church. This entailed that the Roman-Catholic Italians and Irish, for instance, had to abjure all belief in the temporal authority of the pope. Their church had to become a voluntary civil organization with the purpose of religious worship. In other words, the Roman-Catholics could truly become part of American society, but to do so they had to cease being genuine Catholics and become a Protestant church with Catholic beliefs. I think that what has happened afterwards with the Jews, the Black movement, the Gay movement, etc. is very similar. They can invoke the strategies of identity politics and the rights discourse in much the same way as the separate Protestant sub-churches could earlier in the sphere of public debate, education, etc. But the basic structure of society\u0026ndash;the state, politics, law\u0026ndash;is still determined by the overlapping Protestant consensus model. Therefore, the groups who demand recognition of their separate identity are straitjacketed into the cultural constraints of a sub-church. This is the maximal space American society can allow them, without overturning its basic structure.\nThe response of Indians in America is subject to the same model and its mechanisms to conform each cultural community into the niche of a sub-church. The demand for an equal representation between \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo;, Christianity, Islam and Judaism (\u0026lsquo;all religions ought to be represented equally\u0026rsquo;) is part of this process of transformation. If one strives for \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; to be represented in the same way as the Semitic religions, one becomes an accomplice in the straitjacketing of the Indian traditions into the constraints of the overlapping Protestant consensus model.\n","tags":[],"title":"Indian Americans and Identity Politics","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/indian-americans-and-identity-politics/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","normative","NRI","stories","symbolism"],"content":" Vyasa\u0026rsquo;s argument (to the extent we can speak of an argument in this context) is quite subtle: When Urvasi comes to Arjuna at the behest of his father, and when she is possessed by desire, and when the Apsaras choose freely and unconfined, then (a) one cannot reject her; (b) and with the argument that she is a superior to him. If you split this conjunction and cast in normative terms, it says something like this: (a) Rejection of a woman is not permitted when one\u0026rsquo;s father indicates that a son should sleep with a woman; (b) Rejection of a woman is not permitted when the woman is sexually attracted to oneself; (c) Rejection of a woman, whoever she might be, is not permitted when she chooses freely and without confines. Because such a rejection is triply prohibited (or forbidden), Arjuna\u0026rsquo;s argument that he \u0026lsquo;ought not\u0026rsquo; to sleep with the parent of his race (which has only one prohibition) possesses less value. So, Urvasi is justified in her curse of Arjuna. In other words, if we read this fragment of Mahabharata in normative terms, Arjuna was wrong in not having an incestuous relationship with one of his great-great-grandparents. 1\u0026rsquo;. While one could argue that one \u0026lsquo;ought not\u0026rsquo; to sleep with the \u0026lsquo;superiors\u0026rsquo;, Urvasi suggests that because she has chosen freely, this argument is void. On top of saying why Arjuna is wrong to reject sleeping with her, she also comes up with two other reasons why he could sleep with her: (a) Arjuna\u0026rsquo;s ancestors have done so and without committing any \u0026lsquo;sin\u0026rsquo;; therefore, it is \u0026lsquo;permissible\u0026rsquo; that he does the same; (b) it is a morally good thing to emulate one\u0026rsquo;s ancestors and therefore Arjuna \u0026lsquo;ought to\u0026rsquo; sleep with her.\nDoes not your moral intuition (let me use this word for a moment) tell you that both Urvasi and Arjuna were right, in a moral sense, she for cursing him and he for not sleeping with her? Making sense of such possibilities, in a consistent, coherent and systematic way, is what the Indian, non-normative ethics all about.\nAll the NRI\u0026rsquo;s live in a culture that thinks normatively. When we speak in English about ethics, we are invariably forced into a normative language. The western intellectuals reason about ethics exclusively in normative terms. Such intellectuals too have access to the texts the way Sarika has access to them as well. So, imagine any one of such intellectuals confronting your child about \u0026lsquo;Brihannale\u0026rsquo; (just when s/he has finished a spirited defence of how Indian culture always respected eunuchs or some such thing) by citing this piece from Vyasa\u0026rsquo;s Mahabharata! Your child would die of shame, especially if such a citation is accompanied (as it normally will be) with the remark I have made.\nNot only will all \u0026lsquo;symbolic\u0026rsquo; interpretations of Mahabharata come to naught with one such incident; worse, it becomes entirely counter-productive: instead of fostering respect, which the \u0026lsquo;symbolic interpretation\u0026rsquo; is supposed to for the Indian culture, such an interpretation will end up humiliating your child when it confronts the fool-blooded Indian traditions, its texts, and their translations. Even this part, which Sarika did not excerpt fully, is full of references to the physical beauty of Urvasi. (None of the parents would ever dream of talking to their children about feminine charms this way. They would consider such descriptions, today, as pornography.)\nBy saying this, I do not doubt the capacity or the ingenuity of the parents: I am sure that at least some could come up with some kind of an ad hoc explanation that explains this particular fragment away. However, in taking such a path, one underestimates the intelligence of the child, the pressure it faces in its milieu, and the strength of the surrounding culture in which the child has to live. The western culture has not become what it is, one of the great cultures in the history of humanity, by readily accepting simple-minded explanations that explain nothing.\nThe more you protect your child from understanding the culture in its full glory, the more you feed it with dried-out, bi-dimensional, puritanical interpretative rubbish, the greater is the damage you inflict. Keep this in mind. For my part, none of the manifestations of the Indian culture embarrasses me: I do not know everything about the Indian culture; there are more texts I have not read than I have; I might not even agree with some or another argument or attitude in the Indian traditions, ashamed I am not. For that, I have to thank my upbringing and my mother: she faced no problems in helping me understand why Shiva is worshipped in the form of Linga or why Urvasi was justified in cursing him (and so was Arjuna justified, she said).\n","tags":[],"title":"Vacuity of NRIs and their symbolic interpretations","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/vacuity-of-nris-and-their-symbolic-interpretations/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","NRI","stories","symbolism"],"content":"Let us begin with the assumption that our stories about Indra and the Gandharvas are just that: stories, authored by human beings, without truth-content. (That is to say, they are neither true nor false.) When human beings write stories, their imagination is (partially) constrained by their societies, cultures and the times they live in. None quite knows how exactly the latter constrain human imagination even though the extant theories about myths try to explicate this relation: some see in them a mirroring of society, some see in them a disguised historiography or sociology, some see in them a personification of virtues, and so on. Because this issue is not settled yet, I shall presuppose the truth of none of the theories about myths that dot the landscape. However, I take the \u0026lsquo;constraint\u0026rsquo; I spoke about to incorporate the following minimal claim: the myths suggest that some attitudes fall within the limits (or transgress them, as the case may be) of the cultures whose myths they are. Under this assumption, let me isolate some of the attitudes that come to the fore if we look at our stories about apsaras.\nDifferent kinds of sentient creatures (different species?) populate the cosmos, ranging from the human through the Rakshasa to the Gandharva. Marriages are a matter for the traditions which one belongs to. However, no one tradition is privileged above the others in matters of marriage: a human being could use any tradition of marriage and have his/her group accept the validity of such a marriage. One could also marry the Rakshasas (Bhima with Hidembe) and procreate with them (Ghatotkacha): neither the marriage nor the progeny are discriminated against. The stories of Arjuna, Bhima, Vishwamitra etc. tell us that one could inter-marry across sentient creatures (species?). (If that is the case, inter-jati marriages, which are marriages between human beings, are neither revolutionary nor prohibited.) In so far as sex is concerned, sex between different kinds of sentient creatures is not prohibited. If we combine this with the Indian conceptions of sentience and add the notion of species to it, we get the following: sex with species other than human beings is not a matter of ethical injunctions. (Perhaps, that is the reason why Kamasutra reports sex between human beings and other species without expressing any moral indignation.) In that case, the latter is not a perversion. (Contrast the Biblical injunctions about sex with this attitude.)\nProstitution exists everywhere, including among devas. If prostitution is so ubiquitous that it exists among both human communities and the devas, then one cannot abolish it by prohibiting it. A married creature (an apsara) could be a prostitute without affecting her status among the devas. Consequently, neither occasional nor systematic adultery is a matter of ethical judgement purely on the basis of adultery alone. Rishis could have sex and marry (temporarily); this did not affect their status. Just because a woman sleeps with multiple men and procreates with each one of them (Draupadi, the apsaras), she does not lose her \u0026lsquo;purity\u0026rsquo; (\u0026lsquo;pavitrya\u0026rsquo;). That is to say, sex is not subject to ethical norms or injunctions; it cannot be constrained and morally condemned. It can only be guided and made cultured and civilized. Furthermore, if apsaras also marry, this means that we could also have married prostitutes. One could be a wife and a prostitute without violating ethical injunctions. In that case, the \u0026lsquo;prostitute\u0026rsquo; does not function as a contrast set to \u0026lsquo;wife\u0026rsquo; in the Indian traditions.\nThese are merely some of the many more attitudes suggested by our stories about apsaras. I consider such attitudes extremely liberating, very enlightened, and completely non-coercive. It is my hunch that such attitudes prevent (if prevention is possible) the emergence of sexual perversions in society. It channelizes the human sexual instinct into civilized forms without brutalizing human beings in the process. I really do think that the attitude of Indian culture towards sex far surpasses anything we know today: neither Freud nor the \u0026lsquo;sexual liberation\u0026rsquo; of the 60\u0026rsquo;s can even hold a candle to what I have learned from an \u0026lsquo;orthodox\u0026rsquo; upbringing in India. Calling apsaras as \u0026ldquo;prostitutes in the court of Indra\u0026rdquo; does not demean the nature of Indian traditions or culture. It merely recognizes our intellectuals for what they were: extraordinarily perceptive and humane in their attitudes towards fellow human beings.\nComments Umang Dixit — 2014-01-26 00:50:00\nThis all may be true but how de we revive this in the India of today? Attitudes among contemporary Indians are extremely prudish and the expression of the sexual impulse exists only in brutish form.\n","tags":[],"title":"Indian culture’s attitude toward sex vs. Christian Morality","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/indian-cultures-attitude-toward-sex-vs-christian-morality/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","basics"],"content":"Contrast sets have multiple functions depending on the contexts in which they are used. For instance, in the case of theories about some phenomena, they can be used to test the robustness of the theories: why do unsupported objects on earth fall downwards instead of floating? Why did the Primitive Man invent \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo; instead of doing any number of other things he could have done? And so on. In such cases, one might be looking for reasons to accept an explanation temporarily or one might even be comparing rival explanations.\nWe can also use contrast sets in the process of delimiting the meanings of certain words. For instance, does \u0026lsquo;hobo\u0026rsquo; mean something different from, say, \u0026lsquo;vagabond\u0026rsquo;? Or, again, is \u0026lsquo;faithfulness\u0026rsquo; the antonym for \u0026lsquo;adultery\u0026rsquo;? And so on. Here, we try to grasp the meaning of a word by contrasting them to other words that are either synonyms or antonyms. Or, as in my case, the exercise could even consist of trying to discover which words carry the opposite meaning.\nThe use of contrast sets is a heuristic device that often helps us decide. That is why I suggested that we use the contrast sets in our discussion about \u0026lsquo;prostitutes\u0026rsquo;: there was an overlap in our discussion about the word between the properties of modern prostitution, the multiple meanings of an English word, a social institution, and an ethical characterization.\nWhen we use the English word \u0026lsquo;prostitution\u0026rsquo;, we are, it is true, governed by the linguistic intuitions regarding the use of the word. However, we are not entirely governed by such a linguistic intuition or the theology behind it. This thread about Apsaras is a case in point: while none of us have problems in calling some women in the red-light district in Bombay as \u0026lsquo;prostitutes\u0026rsquo;, we do not agree all with whether or not Apsaras are also prostitutes. Perhaps, some among them might be willing to call them \u0026lsquo;Veshyas\u0026rsquo;, while refusing to translate it as \u0026lsquo;prostitutes\u0026rsquo;; yet others, perhaps, would not even go that far. You seem to raise issues about whether we should say that a \u0026lsquo;patni\u0026rsquo; is a \u0026lsquo;wife\u0026rsquo;, or whether the very use of the word \u0026lsquo;wife\u0026rsquo; (because its meaning is partly defined by its antonyms) involves subscribing to Christian theology. I do not have a firm advice to give on this score. Yet, here is what I have been doing: I use whatever I have been using (the English language, in this case) as though the rest is unproblematic while focusing on some problems that the use of this language confronts us with. It is like repairing a boat while sailing on it. Whenever I face a problem, I focus only on it and keep the rest of the background stable and unchanged. I do not know how else one could solve a problem.\n","tags":[],"title":"Contrast sets","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/contrast-sets/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","basics"],"content":"X says: \u0026ldquo;Modern prostitution is a very specific institution with the features of pimps, forced sex, kidnapped women, drug addicted women, immigrants lured to foreign shores on false pretences, and so on. If we insist on precision in ideas, then it is counterproductive to confuse matters by calling Apsaras prostitutes without first showing that at least some of the above conditions hold true and there is some structural similarity.\u0026rdquo;\nIndeed, \u0026lsquo;modern\u0026rsquo; prostitution is all these things and more. However, I did not claim anywhere that Apsaras are \u0026lsquo;modern\u0026rsquo; prostitutes in any sense of the word. Nor did I suggest that there was \u0026lsquo;institutionalized prostitution\u0026rsquo; in India or that our stories suggest that there is such an institution in \u0026lsquo;Swarga\u0026rsquo;. The whole discussion is about a single sentence and I responded by laying out my reasons to call Apsaras as \u0026lsquo;prostitutes in the court of Indra\u0026rsquo;. To say today what I thought was evident (\u0026rsquo;evident\u0026rsquo; because that is what I learned as a child), I do not need to have any kind of a specific theory about \u0026lsquo;modern prostitution\u0026rsquo; or even one about what \u0026lsquo;prostitution\u0026rsquo; generally is about.\nWhile I do insist on precision in ideas, I have no fetishes about precision as such. That is, I do not shut people up simply because they are imprecise in their formulations. Precision is required when the discussion gets derailed because of imprecision, and \u0026lsquo;definitions\u0026rsquo;, which can define words very precisely, are interesting for me for reasons other than precision. If anything, I insist on \u0026lsquo;knowledge\u0026rsquo; about phenomena and believe that theories about phenomena do provide us with knowledge. Even here, because I allow explicitly for kinds of knowledge different from theoretical knowledge, I do not insist that we have theories about everything before we begin a discussion. To the extent I demand precision when we discuss \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo;, it is related to the fact that there is a clear theory about it and we can be more productive if we focus on that theory.\nIn the presence of this thread, you see evidence of confusion arising from \u0026lsquo;referring\u0026rsquo; to Indian customs as prostitution without a theory about prostitution. Well, that is your appreciation. Mine is different: I am surprised by why people do not want to call apsaras as \u0026lsquo;prostitutes in the court of Indra\u0026rsquo;, why they are offended by the use of this word, and what they would like to call apsaras instead. I do not know whether there is a substantial problem at hand, or whether a more familiar problem has resurfaced here, and so on. In the process of this discussion, I hope to become clear about what we are discussing. Here, I do not face any problem in bouncing thoughts and ideas around, gropingly go forward in indentifying the reasons of controversy, and do this without possessing any kind of theory about the phenomenon. Besides, it is not clear to me which problems a theory of prostitution should solve. Nor do I know whether we need a sociological theory about the institution or a psychological theory that tells us about motivations or a biological theory about its universality or a combination of all these together with an ethical theory.\nAs I see it, the discussion is about my linguistic decision to use the word \u0026lsquo;prostitutes\u0026rsquo; in characterizing apsaras. I have given reasons for my decision to say that it is not entirely arbitrary. One can ask for reasons why one chooses to translate a word one way instead of another (\u0026lsquo;why translate \u0026lsquo;Veshya\u0026rsquo; as a prostitute and not as a \u0026lsquo;courtesan?\u0026rsquo;); one can even ask why call apsaras as prostitutes. I have given my reasons. However, neither of the two requires the presence of a theory either about modern prostitution in particular or a theory that tells us what the differences are between \u0026lsquo;prostitution in general\u0026rsquo; and its modern variant. If such a condition is advanced, two things happen: (a) we cannot discuss about most phenomena in societies and cultures; (b) one prevents theory-formation about such phenomena as well.\n","tags":[],"title":"Does one need a theory to discuss about phenomena?","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/does-one-need-a-theory-to-discuss-about-phenomena/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","Christianity"],"content":" In so far as the suggestion is that the English word \u0026lsquo;prostitute\u0026rsquo; does not capture the connotations of the earlier uses of \u0026lsquo;Veshya\u0026rsquo;, as I said, I agree with all of you. In this sense, if you further suggest that \u0026lsquo;Apsara\u0026rsquo; should not be considered as a synonym for \u0026lsquo;prostitute\u0026rsquo;, I would also agree. I do not suggest that \u0026lsquo;apsara\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;prostitute\u0026rsquo; are synonyms: for two words to be synonymous in this context, we need that both words refer to one and the same set of objects. This cannot be the case here because \u0026lsquo;apsara\u0026rsquo; picks out only non-human entities, whereas \u0026lsquo;prostitute\u0026rsquo; can also refer to human beings. I would also be grateful if anyone has a better suggestion for translating \u0026lsquo;Veshya\u0026rsquo;. As I said in an earlier post,\u0026lsquo;courtesan\u0026rsquo; is an alternative. However, a \u0026lsquo;courtesan\u0026rsquo; is also a prostitute, whatever else she is. On this, linguistic part, there are no disagreements.\nI do not know whether a more substantial point is being made on this issue. In the hope of becoming clearer about that implicit point, let me provide some additional reasons why I prefer to call \u0026lsquo;apsaras\u0026rsquo; as \u0026ldquo;prostitutes in the court of Indra\u0026rdquo;.\nWhen we say that someone is a \u0026lsquo;vidwan\u0026rsquo; in the court of a king, we call such a person a \u0026ldquo;courtly vidwan\u0026rdquo; (\u0026lsquo;asthana vidwan\u0026rsquo;); someone who is a jester in a court is called the \u0026lsquo;courtly jester\u0026rsquo; and so on. In exactly the same sense, calling \u0026lsquo;apsaras\u0026rsquo; as \u0026ldquo;prostitutes in the court of Indra\u0026rdquo; is to say that they are (a) courtly prostitutes and (b) the court under consideration is that of Indra. Indra, according to our stories, holds court in one of the three worlds, \u0026lsquo;swarga\u0026rsquo;, with earth and \u0026rsquo;naraka\u0026rsquo; being the other two worlds.\n\u0026lsquo;Apsaras\u0026rsquo;, apparently, are a different kind of species than humans are. Rambha, Urvashi and Menaka are the most-well known among them: well-known not only for their beauty but also for their mastery of arts and for being the instruments of Indra\u0026rsquo;s wishes. Whenever a human being (or even some Rakshasas) undertake(s) \u0026rsquo;tapas\u0026rsquo; that is construed by Indra as a threat to his kingship, he sends the apsaras down to earth in order to distract such an individual. By all accounts, he invariably succeeds in his goal. It is unclear whether the apsaras retain their physical form when they come down to earth or assume a human form. (Often, their assumption of a human form is used to explain their lack of \u0026lsquo;fidelity\u0026rsquo;: in each human form the apsaras assume, they remain \u0026rsquo;loyal\u0026rsquo; to the individual with whom they live and produce children.) While it is clear that the \u0026lsquo;apsaras\u0026rsquo; entertain the court through music and dance, it is unclear what else they do in Indra\u0026rsquo;s court apart from following his biddings. However, when one speaks of \u0026lsquo;swarga sukha\u0026rsquo;, one speaks of enjoying the bodies of the \u0026lsquo;apsaras\u0026rsquo; in that world. Being \u0026lsquo;Gandharvas\u0026rsquo;, they have their own way of marrying (recognized by the Indian traditions as \u0026lsquo;Gandharva marriage\u0026rsquo;) and also their own conception of marriage. However, it is unclear what their conception of marriage is, even though, on some accounts, these \u0026lsquo;apasras\u0026rsquo; have their own husbands in \u0026lsquo;swarga\u0026rsquo; as well . In any case, the suggestion is that these Gandharvas could marry multiple times, become progenitors of children from multiple beings, fall deeply in love with many people, and yet retain their \u0026lsquo;purity\u0026rsquo; (\u0026lsquo;pavitrya\u0026rsquo;).\nI have not studied the Indian literature where \u0026lsquo;apsaras\u0026rsquo; have figured in order to find out what else they are, but the above is my memory of what I have read in my younger days (while in India). Included in this memory are (a) the conviction that they are courtly prostitutes and (b) coming across a variation of the verse \u0026lsquo;karyeshu dasi, karaneshu mantri\u0026hellip;\u0026rsquo; Instead of \u0026lsquo;Shayaneshu Veshya\u0026rsquo;, I have also come across the variation that says \u0026lsquo;Shayaneshu Rambha\u0026rsquo;. This variation suggests that \u0026lsquo;Veshya\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;Rambha\u0026rsquo; can switch places without affecting the meaning of the verse. (The variation does not say \u0026lsquo;Rupeshu Rambha\u0026rsquo; but \u0026lsquo;Shayaneshu Rambha\u0026rsquo;.)\nOf course, the question is: are they prostitutes or not? This decision will have to be partly based on what the contrast set is or whether there is one. Is \u0026lsquo;wife\u0026rsquo; the contrast set of \u0026lsquo;prostitute\u0026rsquo;? Is \u0026lsquo;marrying for love\u0026rsquo; the contrast set? Is \u0026lsquo;sexual fidelity towards one partner\u0026rsquo; the contrast set? Is \u0026lsquo;having sex for reasons other than money\u0026rsquo; the contrast set? Is \u0026lsquo;mistress\u0026rsquo; the contrast set? Is it the case that the contrast set for \u0026lsquo;prostitute\u0026rsquo; has to be sought elsewhere, namely, in professions like doctors, engineers and lawyers or in such functions as priests? Is \u0026lsquo;prostitute\u0026rsquo; a legal term, defined by laws and statutes or a moral term that expresses moral approval or moral disapproval? Or is it the case that there is no contrast set for \u0026lsquo;Veshya\u0026rsquo;? In Christianity, say, there is both a contrast set and it is fairly simple: a rigid one between the wedded wife (wedded before God and the Christian community) and prostitute, and a milder one between wife, mistress and a prostitute. All the European languages have incorporated this distinction in their languages. Even after the \u0026lsquo;sexual revolution\u0026rsquo; of the 60\u0026rsquo;s, this linguistic intuition has remained; as Jakob put it beautifully once, this \u0026lsquo;sexual liberation\u0026rsquo; has merely put a \u0026ldquo;serial monogamy\u0026rdquo; in place of mere monogamy.\nYou see, what puzzles me about the Indian traditions is their almost uncanny insight into human sexual behavior, amongst other things. Though many communities in India practice polygamy and treatises like the Kamasutra consider that \u0026lsquo;adultery\u0026rsquo;, under some conditions, was ethically praiseworthy, they do not look down on monogamy either: Rama being the case in point. Yet, Rama followed \u0026rsquo;eka patni vrata\u0026rsquo;, i.e., it was a \u0026lsquo;vrata\u0026rsquo; to be monogamous. It could have been a \u0026lsquo;vrata\u0026rsquo; to him because he was a king (and kings were permitted to have multiple wives for \u0026lsquo;reasons of state\u0026rsquo;) and that it was a part of \u0026lsquo;Raja Dharma\u0026rsquo; to be polygamous. But the thing is this: they do not appear to have considered multiple expressions of human sexual instinct as \u0026lsquo;perversions\u0026rsquo;, the way Christianity has done. Instead of banning them, they seem to have focused their intellectual energies on guiding and forming such expressions into cultured and civilized forms. Prostitution is one such expression.\nAs I have said before, I have never been to a prostitute nor will I ever go to one. I am against women being forced and coerced into prostitution because of economic and social reasons. But, deep inside me, something balks at calling them \u0026lsquo;immoral\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;unethical\u0026rsquo;; so, I do not. In my own mind, because of my research no doubt, the word \u0026lsquo;prostitute\u0026rsquo; carries no negative, ethical connotations. Because I also believe that my research results need to be formulated in our twenty first-century language, I use the English word instead of Sanskrit words. I am aware of the risks but I take them willingly. May be, I often think, one of the contributions of Indian culture (today) consists of stretching the English language so much that it breaks the theological confines it is trapped in, and finally yields to conveying meanings other than those required by Christian theology alone. \u0026lsquo;Prostitute\u0026rsquo; is one such word.\nComments Umang Dixit — 2014-01-26 00:28:00\nWonderful, absolutely wonderful.

However, I am not sure whether my claim is really that extreme (with the proviso that we keep in mind the current-day changes in the meanings of the words in both English and Indian languages). Let me explain why. When we read, say, Kamasutra, we discover that prostitutes had to be cultured and learned human beings; they were supposed to be proficient in multiple arts including music, poetry, dance, handicrafts and so on. \u0026lsquo;Treating the prostitutes humanely\u0026rsquo; includes teaching these skills to them: after all, many of the arts they practiced to entertain men requires teaching and learning. This suggests that a teacher could take prostitutes as his/her students and that the society did not disapprove. Instead, it countenanced such teaching. However, this is not all there is to the story. Consider the fact that a prostitute is also called \u0026rsquo;nitya sumangali\u0026rsquo;: one who can never become a widow. As you know, the word \u0026lsquo;sumangali\u0026rsquo; is not usedlightly in India and it carries a very positive connotation as is also indexed by the use of \u0026lsquo;su\u0026rsquo;. (Of course, one uses this term also sarcastically in colloquial language but such use does not take away the positive connotation.) Even though the prostitute never marries, our traditions did not withhold the appellation \u0026lsquo;sumangali\u0026rsquo; from her. Consider too, in this context, the \u0026lsquo;good qualities\u0026rsquo; of a wife: \u0026lsquo;Karyeshu dasi, Karaneshu mantri\u0026hellip;.\u0026rsquo; As this verse (I have forgotten both its source and how it ends) continues, it appears that a wife should also be \u0026lsquo;shayaneshu veshya\u0026rsquo; (a prostitute in bed). Quite independent of the conjectures we can make about its anti-feministic character or whatever, think about what this verse is suggesting: the wife should behave like a prostitute in the bedroom. What does that mean? Whether or not it also means that she should entertain her husband through music, recitation of poetry, dance and such like, one thing is clear: she must be well-versed in sexual matters. Step back for a moment and ask yourself how any girl could be well-versed (better than her husband, in fact) in sexual matters. There are only two possibilities: either the girl had a lot of experience in sex before marriage (there goes the idea of virginity of one\u0026rsquo;s wife) or she was trained and educated in the art of sex in her family. Irrespective of which of the possibilities is true, this verse indicates at least two things: being a prostitute did not make one immoral anymore than visiting a prostitute made one immoral. The prostitute had qualities which a \u0026lsquo;good wife\u0026rsquo; should emulate. Note that these qualities are not those that prostitutes also have; the wife is supposed to have those qualities that make a woman into a prostitute (\u0026lsquo;shayaneshu veshya\u0026rsquo;). Furthermore, in so far as women were taught the \u0026lsquo;art of loving\u0026rsquo; (kama-sutra) in their families, surely, it tells us that the reaction of the middle class in India today is anything but Indian: it is an inherited prudishness drawn from the Victorian morality. It is in this sense that I suggested that the Indians are not prudes in matters of sexuality. In this sense too, in this Indian sense, Apsaras, I claim, are \u0026ldquo;prostitutes in the court of Indra\u0026rdquo;.\nYou are right too when you point out that the word \u0026lsquo;Kama\u0026rsquo;, as a pursushartha, embraces a bigger set than sexual pleasure or romantic love. Perhaps, I did not make myself clear in my earlier post: I use the word kama, in the context of specifying the end-goal of human life, as a synonym for \u0026lsquo;sensual pleasure\u0026rsquo;. Indeed, I use it much the same way you do: \u0026rsquo;that which pleases the senses\u0026rsquo;. However, my point remains: how can you expect to teach about this end-goal in human life to your kids, if you react indignantly to phenomena like prostitution and adultery? How could you call these \u0026lsquo;immoral\u0026rsquo; and yet say that \u0026lsquo;sensual pleasure\u0026rsquo; can also be an end-goal of human striving? One pursues music, the other poetry, and someone else pursues women; surely, all three pursue \u0026lsquo;sensual pleasure\u0026rsquo;, do they not? How, then, is it possible to call the first two \u0026lsquo;great moral beings\u0026rsquo; and castigate the last one as a \u0026rsquo;lecherous and immoral\u0026rsquo; human being? I really do believe that the Indian thinkers were consistent in their thinking and that is something which many Indian parents sadly lack today. They lack this because we have made a particular species of Christian morality our own. There is nothing wrong with this, of course; but permit me to draw your attention to the fact that there are consequences attached to this moral attitude. One such is that you cannot any more claim that Dharma, Artha and Kama (add moksha too, if you feel like) are all on par as human end-goals.\nAccording to the majority of the Indian traditions, \u0026lsquo;Vamachara\u0026rsquo; is an indulgence in excesses; they flout morality of a society and, if they spread deeply and widely in a society, they undercut its ethics and thus lead to its collapse. This criticism is indigenous and is not based on prudishness. And that those who are adulterous (or, at least, those who do not find adultery objectionable) are the \u0026lsquo;vamacharins\u0026rsquo; and that (most, many, the majority of) Indian traditions have taken objections to such a morality. Because these criticisms are native to India and some of her traditions, the indignant responses of the NRI\u0026rsquo;s in the US could also have an Indian origin, unconnected with Victorian morality.\nConsider a Buddha, a Shankara, an Allama Prabhu, a Ramakrishna or even a Ramana Maharishi. Suppose that all Indians follow them and imitate their lives. Those who are married renounce their families and those who are not, do not marry. What would happen to the Indian society? It would cease to exist in two generations, at the most. What follows from this consideration? Does it follow that the people named above and many like them are a danger to society and that our society would collapse if their lives became models for us to follow? Do we consider becoming a sanyasin or joining the Buddhist Sangha a danger to society? Quite obviously not; but why not? That is because these people (their lives, their teachings, etc) are not normative: they do not prescribe what \u0026lsquo;ought\u0026rsquo; to be done by every human being. Most people marry and have family (grihastha); some take to \u0026lsquo;sanyasa\u0026rsquo;; yet others become Bhikkus. The beauty of Indian traditions lies precisely in this absence of normativity: one does not tell the human race what it \u0026lsquo;ought\u0026rsquo; to be doing; one recognizes the variety in human makeup (hence the three or four purusharthas) and strives to help the pursuer pursue his/her goal-in-life. In this sense, the \u0026lsquo;vamacharins\u0026rsquo; too pursue their end-goal, using the means they do use. To say that society would collapse if everyone became a \u0026lsquo;vamacharin\u0026rsquo; is akin to saying that if everyone became a Shankara, the society would collapse. Such criticisms have no teeth.\nHowever, there is something else too. And that is the recognition (often very implicit in all the traditions I know) that the \u0026rsquo;enlightened\u0026rsquo; people are a danger to society. They are that because they challenge the very notion of \u0026rsquo;ethics\u0026rsquo; and the required distinction between \u0026lsquo;good\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;bad\u0026rsquo;. In many places in India, including my own family, people have a double attitude towards Gurus, sanyasins, enlightened, and \u0026lsquo;rishis\u0026rsquo;: there is a combination of awe and fear. As I grew up, I was told that seeing a sanyasin the first thing in the morning, or enroute to an auspicious event, was a bad omen; people were \u0026lsquo;afraid\u0026rsquo; to let a sanyasin or a guru stay in the house. The reason, my mother told me, was that such people were \u0026lsquo;unpredictable\u0026rsquo;; they could do anything and, no matter what they would do, they were beyond ethical reproach. So, we might admire a Shankara or a Vasistha; we are also \u0026lsquo;scared\u0026rsquo; of them. Such people are capable of doing anything and everything and society cannot judge them. (This was my experience while growing up in India; I do not know how much of this is still prevalent.)\nDoes this mean that I find prostitution or adultery \u0026lsquo;good\u0026rsquo;? This is the question I repeatedly confront. The problem is this: this question arises from precisely the same normative framework that my criticism deals with. If the argument is that one cannot suggest that phenomena like these are \u0026lsquo;immoral\u0026rsquo; (i.e. what all human beings are \u0026lsquo;forbidden\u0026rsquo; from doing) from the point of view of Indian traditions (which know of no normativity), then I am supposed to be arguing that it is \u0026lsquo;morally good\u0026rsquo; (i.e. what ll human beings are \u0026lsquo;obliged\u0026rsquo; to do). My whole point is this: this way of talking about ethics, as \u0026lsquo;morally good\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;morally bad\u0026rsquo; for all human beings at all times is the problem of morality as religions (Judaism, Christianity, Islam) formulate them. To these religions, there are a set of \u0026lsquo;moral laws\u0026rsquo;, which God has given to humanity and instructed them to keep to these laws. The so-called Secular ethics today continues an unbroken line with these religious ethics. However, in India, there has been a recognition that ethics is a human invention; consequently, it does not have the status of \u0026rsquo;laws\u0026rsquo; that \u0026lsquo;ought to\u0026rsquo; hold universally. I agree that I still have to write that book on ethics which is long overdue. But this problem will not simply go away just because I might write a book about it one day. One still needs to figure out how the Indians have understood normative ethics and what role the \u0026lsquo;colonial consciousness\u0026rsquo; plays in their understanding; and that I have not yet done. ","tags":[],"title":"Colonial Consciousness and Victorian Morality","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/colonial-consciousness-and-victorian-morality/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","colonial consciousness","normative","NRI","symbolism"],"content":"1.1. The Indian traditions did not have the same attitude as Christianity towards prostitution or adultery. And the Indians of yesteryears were not defenders of the Victorian (and Christian) morality. Of course, I approvingly said that the \u0026ldquo;Indians are not prudes\u0026rdquo; but this approval has to do with the thrust of Indian thought, as I have understood it: the impossibility of prohibiting or making obligatory some or another action universally. (This is my formulation, of course.) I do believe that the Indians recognized the impossibility of abolishing prostitution (which is why it is called \u0026ldquo;the oldest profession\u0026rdquo;). Instead, therefore, of banning and condemning prostitution (and subsequently turn a blind eye towards its existence), Indian thinkers suggested that we treat the prostitutes humanely. I have never been to a prostitute nor will I ever go to one; but that does not mean that I want to ignore their existence and treat them as non-humans. Nor am I willing to call all those who visit prostitutes as criminals and perverts. I know of too many lonely men and women who have found human warmth and personal comfort in the arms and companionship of prostitutes to consider them as perverts.\nHow about adultery? Again, in so far as my citation of Kamasutra can be construed to mean approval, I do believe that the Indian intellectuals had the right attitude towards this phenomenon as well. Today, evolutionary biology has provided us with ample evidence and arguments to show that adultery is a phenomenon that occurs very frequently in nature. (Coincidentally, The New York Times of 18th March 2008 carries an article, in its \u0026lsquo;Science\u0026rsquo; section titled \u0026ldquo;In Most Species, Faithfulness is a Fantasy\u0026rdquo;, which is about adultery.) Indians thinkers probably believed that adultery was also frequent in human communities. Instead of fulminating against it from the pulpit, which does not in any way solve the problem, Indians tried to devise ways and means to steer it into more controllable paths. I consider this attitude to be more humane than simply making normative pronouncements about it.\n1.2. In this sense, I do and did approve the attitude of Indian thinkers of yesteryears towards both prostitution and adultery. I consider such an attitude both laudable and humane. From such an approval, does any advice follow? Yes, treat them both humanely. I do not recommend to my daughter that she chooses prostitution as her career just because I tell her to treat prostitutes humanely, do I? By advising my sons to treat murderers humanely, I do not tell them to become murderers, do I? I do not believe that the kids were \u0026lsquo;confused\u0026rsquo; about these issues at all. In that case, why did they raise the questions they apparently raised and acted as though they were confused?\nI fail to appreciate the way the Indians regurgitate Victorian, Christian prudishness and become sanctimonious at the faintest whiff of anything to the contrary. Selling an ironed-out, bi-dimensional, puritanical, neo-Vedantic strain of \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; to these kids is to do them incalculable harm. It is this attitude which makes them feel embarrassed about being \u0026lsquo;Hindus\u0026rsquo; when they confront the full-blooded Indian traditions. Surely, our devas are adulterous, are they not? Our Apsaras, what are they except prostitutes in the court of Indra? How will one ever explain what a Menaka has done with multiple Rishis, or even why some of the Devatas send Apsaras to distract the tapas of these rishis? What kind of a \u0026lsquo;symbolic\u0026rsquo; explanation will one give for Krishna having a rasalila or rathikreede with 16,000 women? What will one do with the puranic story, which tells us why Shiva is worshipped in the form of a Linga, or why there are hardly any temples of Brahma? What do you do with Draupadi or with the fact that Bhima, Arjuna, etc. not only married many other women but also made children with these women? How will one even explain one of the purusharthas, namely Kama, which is accepted as one of the legitimate goals of human strivings? What will these kids do, when the western intellectuals mock the anti-septic \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; they are being taught and come up with stories from our own traditions which say all the above and more?\nNo matter whether I agree with everything I have been taught and learnt about our culture, I am not ashamed of belonging to the Indian traditions. On the contrary. The more I learn about how the Indian intellectuals have thought about issues like sex, adultery, incest and prostitution, the more my admiration for my traditions grows. I consider their ways of thinking about these issues far, far superior to what either Christianity has said or even what the western ethical theories have done so far. Because of this, I am not worried about talking about these issues openly, whether it is with teenagers or with the older folk. Some people might get shocked; but this did not prevent our traditions from thinking and discussing such issues. Neither will I.\n","tags":[],"title":"Victorian morality of NRI and middle class Hindus: Prostitution, Adultery","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/victorian-morality-of-nri-and-middle-class-hindus-prostitution-adultery/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","colonial consciousness"],"content":"Let me invite you to do a thought-experiment along with me.\nImagine that all human beings seek happiness. Imagine too that they can all achieve this state of being. Because, as I said in one of my posts, there are no qualifications (or requirements) to reach this end-state; any and all ways are conducive to reach this end-state: thinking, meditation, music, dance, and, yes, even going to temples and reciting \u0026lsquo;sahasranaamams.\u0026rsquo; At any and every stage and moment, people can achieve happiness.\nSuch a system (or such a structure of society) is the most ideal \u0026ldquo;social security system\u0026rdquo; that can ever be built. No human being falls outside the safety net and there are routes from every point to this end-state that all human beings seek. The system guarantees each one of us that we can be happy and provides us with just the route we want (and can follow) to become happy.\nLike all social security systems, this one also requires to be constantly replenished. It too has to draw upon the \u0026rsquo;total wealth\u0026rsquo; of society to keep itself reproducing. This wealth is also continually reproduced: new stories, new rituals, and performance of what already exists as stories and rituals, drama, poetry\u0026hellip; and so on.\nAs society and its environment changes, to keep this social security system going, this wealth has to be constantly reproduced and replenished. For this to happen, people should continue to see what is being produced as \u0026lsquo;wealth\u0026rsquo;. What happens when slowly, over a period of time, people do not see it any more as \u0026lsquo;wealth\u0026rsquo;? The system slowly starts unraveling because new contributions to this \u0026ldquo;social security system\u0026rdquo; are not seen as contributions to such a system any more. Though a massive social process and change, this does not mean that people, all of a sudden, change their ways of looking: some still see stories as wealth (i.e. some can still learn from them), some still go to harikatha (and learn from it), some still go to the temples (and find happiness in the puja and the sahasranaamams)\u0026hellip; But the \u0026ldquo;social security system\u0026rdquo; starts falling apart (slowly): it cannot be sustained any further in the way it was and it ceases to be the safety net that it once was to all the people. But it does not completely disappear or totally disintegrate because it is in the nature of this society to build such a net. So, even as parts begin to become unsustainable, there is both an attempt to take the slack that comes into being and new attempts to rejuvenate the entire system.\n\u0026lsquo;Colonial consciousness\u0026rsquo; is about one aspect of the how and why of this unraveling. It is like saying some parts of the industrial production has died. We need to shift the \u0026rsquo;economy\u0026rsquo; to become reliant on other kinds of production (either other industrial products or build the service industry) so that we could replenish the social security system. We see that many have opted out of the system: we need to make it clear to them that \u0026ldquo;private insurance\u0026rdquo; will never work; it will not provide them with the safety net they seek\u0026hellip;\n","tags":[],"title":"What is the most ideal social security system (safety net)?","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/what-is-the-most-ideal-social-security-system-safety-net/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara"],"content":"I think there is a simpler answer to why we do not eat beef: \u0026ldquo;we do not see it as food.\u0026rdquo; In the same way people in the Nazi concentration camps and the Ethiopians during the famine did not see fellow human beings as edible items, we do not see cows as food. (Contrast this with the story of a plane crash in the Andes Mountain some three decades ago, where the dead were cannibalized by the living in order to survive.) Culture, upbringing and even beliefs (in the case of some people) could help explain this situation.

The learning occurs through imitation, following instructions, through stories and so on. Consequently, traditions \u0026lsquo;change\u0026rsquo; (i.e. undergo modifications) even as they are being transmitted and learnt. This makes traditions flexible and adaptive.\nHuman practices conserve, that is, we do not go around inventing new practices every day. In this sense, traditions are essentially conserving in their nature. This is one of the reasons why we see \u0026lsquo;being traditional\u0026rsquo; as `being conservative\u0026rsquo; as well.\nBecause learning is an individual affair, it is the individual who decides which practices to modify drastically, which to retain and which to abandon altogether. Such changes might occur through reflection, in discussions, due to advice from others or because of sheer impracticability. In other words, changing of the tradition is an intrinsically individual affair. By the same token, what counts as tradition and what does not is also an individual affair. Each individual recognizes some practices as traditions and to some extent this varies from individual to individual. This situation is recognized by those who follow traditions as well: \u0026ldquo;this is the tradition in our family.\u0026rdquo;\nThis makes it obvious that what counts as tradition and what does not is not a matter of providing some set of criteria beforehand. Any inherited/modified practice is a tradition or it is not: that depends on the how the individual views it. Is drinking water a tradition? That depends: while people drink beer in Europe when they are thirsty, I drink water under similar circumstances. Drinking beer or wine while thirsty increases my thirst; whereas it is common to notice people enjoying beer as an antidote to thirst during warm summer afternoons in Europe. Is this a tradition? To those it is a tradition, it is, but not to those to whom it is not.\nFrom all the learnt/inherited practices, individuals might call a subset of them as traditions. Several such individuals might have overlapping sets of practices and many might create distinct subsets. Most of us cannot enumerate what our traditions are, even if we are willing to call only some of our practices as traditions. Is wearing a \u0026lsquo;banian\u0026rsquo; at home a \u0026rsquo;tradition\u0026rsquo;? One could go either way: to some, it is, to some it is not. While we are willing to recognize that wearing a cotton shawl on a naked upper torso was the tradition of our grandparents, we might or might not want to call our fathers wearing a \u0026lsquo;banian\u0026rsquo; as a tradition.\nHuman practices do not come with labels attached, identifying only some practices as traditions and others as \u0026rsquo;non-traditions\u0026rsquo;. It is individuals who call some or another practice, which they consider important, as \u0026lsquo;practicing tradition\u0026rsquo;. Perhaps, in the course of our learning, we also learn how or why we isolate some practice as an important one. However, the circumstances of individuals vary: singing a particular composition using a particular \u0026rsquo;tala\u0026rsquo; might be considered as a tradition by a music teacher; another teacher might not think in this way. To those of us who are not musicians, perhaps, this issue is completely a matter of indifference. In short, profound though it might appear, the question, \u0026lsquo;which is a tradition and which is not?\u0026rsquo; is not an interesting question. Who `decides\u0026rsquo; whether some or another practice belongs to a tradition or not? The individual, to whom it is a tradition, considers it so. Does he/she need a Guru or a Swami to decide? That depends not on the practice but on the individual. For instance, some individual might want to consult \u0026lsquo;swamis\u0026rsquo; on issues of doing puja in the US; yet others might decide on their own. One might defend both these practices as traditions as well. Why do any of these matter?\nTraditions vary from individual to individual and retain, at the same time, a recognizable pattern and structure when we look at them inter-individually. This is has to do with the fact individuals learn and that learning is creative; and with the fact that what one learns is a practice, which conserves.\nAre Sati, Child marriage, and such like traditions? Yes, they were and are to those who practice(d) it. Are they my traditions too? As far as I know, Sati is not; but my mother did get married at a very young age, my grandmother at even an earlier age. However, the marrying age of my sisters changed over a period of time: my eldest sister got married when she was 16 (my aunt when she was 12), but she was also the last in my family to be married off so early. As I have said, reason has the role of curtailing the \u0026rsquo;excesses\u0026rsquo; of human practice and my mother decided to abandon the tradition of marrying her children off early because, she said, \u0026rsquo;times have changed\u0026rsquo;. My eldest sister did not think of marrying her children off until they were well into their late twenties and I am going to let my children decide if, when and whom they want to marry. This ability to modify or abandon a \u0026rsquo;tradition\u0026rsquo; is a choice left to an individual based on some kind of reasoning. However, as I make it clear, one does not even need reasons to abandon a traditional practice because one is not obliged to practice a tradition: a shrug of shoulders would do as an answer to the question, \u0026lsquo;why do you not do Ganesha Puja?\u0026rsquo;\nFollowing a tradition is totally unlike following a moral injunction. When one says \u0026lsquo;Sati, Child marriage, Dowry, Untouchability, etc\u0026rsquo; are followed in India because they are \u0026lsquo;Indian traditions\u0026rsquo;, one could have the following understanding of tradition in mind: these are practices that one \u0026lsquo;ought to\u0026rsquo; follow because one\u0026rsquo;s ancestors practiced them too. This is how the colonial and the western mind interpret the notion of \u0026rsquo;tradition\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;practice\u0026rsquo;. To them, following a tradition is akin to following a moral obligation written down in some or another text. Except that, when speaking of \u0026lsquo;following a tradition\u0026rsquo;, they are willing to make the concession that one is following \u0026lsquo;oral texts\u0026rsquo; (of sorts). To them, justifying a practice by referring to an age-old practice is equivalent to a moral justification of a practice. They have difficulties in thinking in any other way because they are captivated by the idea that \u0026lsquo;religious texts\u0026rsquo; (whether written or oral) impose moral obligations on us and we have to obey them if we have to be religious. This understanding of tradition (more accurately, this misunderstanding of tradition) makes them come up with silly stories and even sillier questions about the nature of Indian traditions.\n","tags":[],"title":"Is tradition akin to following moral obligations?","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/is-tradition-akin-to-following-moral-obligations/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","stories","symbolism"],"content":"1. Here is one way of looking at what stories are. They are symbols. What are they symbols of? Well, they could symbolize acts; they could also be symbolically interpreted as justifications of such acts. Under this construal, a story requires an interpretation: one has to interpret the story as a symbol of either an act or as its symbolic justification. (The same applies to looking at stories as symbols of values. The stories, for instance, could be seen to symbolize virtues. Stories could also symbolize passions, feelings, natural forces\u0026hellip;) Then, stories are mostly, if not always, symbols of something or another. When you look at the issue this way, it is almost akin to saying that stories are \u0026ldquo;evidences\u0026rdquo; of sorts: some story or another provides \u0026ldquo;evidence\u0026rdquo; about the presence of \u0026ldquo;something else\u0026rdquo;. (Let us leave aside the issue of what it means to talk of a symbol in all these contexts or what \u0026ldquo;evidence\u0026rdquo; means here. Both terms can be understood in a vague sense for our purposes.) In another language, we can say that all stories are signs. These signs must be turned into signifiers (this requires an act of interpretation) by showing or suggesting that they signify \u0026ldquo;something else\u0026rdquo; (called the signified).\nIf whenever talking about a story, or even telling one, involves an interpretation of the story, then there are always multiple interpretations of a story available at the marketplace. How does one decide which story is better or what happens when there are conflicts of interpretation? The listener chooses the interpretation s/he \u0026ldquo;likes\u0026rdquo;; the customer puts across another, different interpretation. One chooses whatever one likes and on whatever ground one prefers. What governs an interpretation? Obviously, no \u0026ldquo;rules\u0026rdquo; govern interpretations; if they do, it is almost impossible to say what they are. This is the only possible position because the story is a \u0026ldquo;symbol\u0026rdquo; (or the signifier) and what it symbolizes (the signified) is governed by the subjectivity of the interpreter. Consequently, it could be the background beliefs of the interpreter, his/her cultural beliefs, his/her prejudices, his/her pet theories\u0026hellip;. Here, as must be obvious, \u0026ldquo;interpretation\u0026rdquo; literally means that one maps some object in one domain (the domain of stories) to another domain (the domain of objects, events, forces, acts\u0026hellip;) This mapping is not done by a logical or a mathematical function but by the interpreter and his subjectivity. Thus, the disagreements between people is about the \u0026ldquo;acceptability\u0026rdquo; of the interpretation and this, acceptability is, as I said, left completely to the chance vagaries of the particular customer: one might disagree that some interpretation is \u0026ldquo;respectable\u0026rdquo; or whereas another finds it not \u0026ldquo;lurid enough\u0026rdquo;; one might find some interpretation \u0026ldquo;shocking\u0026rdquo; or the other might reject it as \u0026ldquo;too conservative\u0026rdquo;; one might find reject some interpretation as too \u0026ldquo;offensive\u0026rdquo; or whereas the other accepts the same because it is \u0026ldquo;flattering\u0026rdquo; and so on.\nThis is one of the dominant conceptions of \u0026ldquo;myth\u0026rdquo; in the western intellectual tradition, where \u0026ldquo;myth\u0026rdquo; is contrasted to \u0026ldquo;fact\u0026rdquo;: the one is false (myth), it is not history; the other is true, the building block of history. One can take this approach in multiple directions: rituals, for instance, are seen as symbols and enact myths; stories, for instance, symbolize mental or cultural phenomena and so on. Many, many Indians have absorbed this notion in multiple ways and, thus raise all kinds of questions: why perform the funerary rites? What is their \u0026ldquo;significance\u0026rdquo;? What is the meaning of rituals? What do mudras mean? And so on and so forth.\nMany Indians appear to have accepted this set of ideas, either implicitly or explicitly. I am not sure whether they themselves are aware that they are working within the ambit of such a framework. However, all their objections emerge from this idea about myths. They think, for instance, I interpret the Bhima-Hidimba story as an expression of inter-species sex or as condoning it; that is why they ask whether Indians ever interpret it this way when they hear the stories or the author ever \u0026ldquo;intended\u0026rdquo; to convey this meaning. They see that my interpretation of this story (which, they think, interprets the story by mapping it to sexuality) is \u0026ldquo;unfair\u0026rdquo; to the Indians; they understand my critique of Kripal and Courtright as though I say that their \u0026ldquo;interpretations\u0026rdquo; of the story of Ganesha and Ramakrishna violates the experience of the Indians; because the interpretation of a story one gives is dependent upon the subjectivity of the interpreter, they see in my alleged interpretation of Bhima-Hidimbe interpretation, my own individual samskara (or background or psychology); that is why they appear to prefer an interpretation of apsaras as \u0026ldquo;phenomenon of the mind\u0026rdquo;, an interpretation that makes use of Vedas and Upanishads (according to them). They are probably not very well aware that they see stories as symbols because, when Jakob took objection to the notion of symbol, Vinayaka had no problem in withdrawing the technical term and replacing it with the notion of \u0026ldquo;evidence\u0026rdquo;: whether or not I use the story of Bhima and Hidimabe as an \u0026ldquo;evidence\u0026rdquo; for inter-species sex. Because of this stance that stories are symbols of (or evidences for) something else in the world, they want to know whether I base my \u0026ldquo;interpretation\u0026rdquo; of the word Apsara is based on any evidence or research. Because they apparently feel that one of the standards of accepting interpretation of stories in terms of their \u0026ldquo;fairness\u0026rdquo; of the description of Indian experiences or in the accuracy that such a description has, they feel I am doing exactly what (they think) I am criticizing a Wendy of doing. And so on and so forth. In other words, everything they have been objecting to in my posts (and almost everything they say) makes sense if I attribute this notion of myth to them. I shall also do so.\n2. In contrast and opposition to the above, stands my conceptualization of stories: they are learning units within a specific process of learning. As exemplars, they solve the problem of executing new actions in novel situations. They are not false; nor are they true (thus are not facts). Stories, as action heuristics, are neither true nor false. Because they are action heuristics, allowing one and the same story to function in multiple contexts, no \u0026lsquo;moral rule\u0026rsquo; is attached to them (the way, say, the fables of Aesop). Stories are what they are because that is how practical or performative knowledge is transmitted in a culture, where performative or practical knowledge dominates. They are products of human imagination and, as such, are on par with poetry, literature, music and dance, philosophy, scientific theories\u0026hellip; etc. (I have written on these issues, so I will not elaborate any further and make this long mail even longer.)\nWhen you look at stories this way, you analyze a story to figure out what the limits of some particular period are. (That is why I say in one of my posts that I make the assumption that stories lay down the limits of human conduct because each author is limited by his time and culture.) Because of this, I started analyzing the story for the presuppositions it makes and the entailed consequences. I said that these stories tell us some kinds of actions are not forbidden: some are recommended, and so on and so forth. That is also why I kept insisting that these analyzes do not tell us how Indian society was nor was my discussion about the institution of prostitution in India. The Hidimba-Bhima story or the story that Sarika extracted, when analyzed in this fashion, provides us with interesting suggestions about the limits of human conduct allowed or disallowed by these stories. Such analyses, in so far as yield to such analyses, makes the thinkers who constructed such stories extra-ordinarily humane. (Please re-read my posts in this light and see whether they make sense.)\nThe noise was created by the clash between two different but implicit conceptions of what stories are, and how and why they matter to a culture. The clash about \u0026lsquo;apsaras\u0026rsquo; was merely a further extension of the point I made about stories as myths. Calling Apsaras as \u0026ldquo;prostitutes in the court of Indra\u0026rdquo; amounts to an interpretation of what \u0026ldquo;apsaras are\u0026rdquo; according to the first conception of the story: \u0026ldquo;interpreting\u0026rdquo; them as apsaras, some found, violates their experience; and that no Indian \u0026ldquo;interprets\u0026rdquo; them in this fashion or that I do exactly what a Wendy does, etc. My conceptualization of stories, on the contrary, has nothing to say about this issue. I do not see it as an \u0026ldquo;interpretation\u0026rdquo; but a mere linguistic convention about using a common noun. While aware of the connotations of the English word \u0026ldquo;prostitute\u0026rdquo;, I still chose it. However, I have my reasons for following this convention and I enumerated a number of them in my posts. Of course, it is not a satisfactory answer at all, when one sees this act as an act of \u0026ldquo;interpretation\u0026rdquo;. As I see it, this is the issue that is causing friction: are stories symbols or signs or evidences for something else in the world or are stories units in a learning process?\n","tags":[],"title":"Are stories symbols?","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/are-stories-symbols/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","enlightenment","experience","indexical","Indian traditions","psychology"],"content":"A science of cultures is not Atmagyaana or Brahmagyaana. Let me also add that I find a quest for happiness a normal human striving.\nAccording to the Indian traditions, experience itself is a state of being: anubhava. In my story, so is happiness (or atmasaakshaatkaara). Need one be enlightened in order to speak about enlightenment? Should that be the case, one cannot strive for enlightenment at all and I think that enlightenment (or happiness) is a legitimate goal for human beings. If happiness is not an esoteric state of being but a legitimate goal for all human beings, there are indefinitely many roads to that state of being. The strength of the Indian traditions lies not merely in recognizing this but also in working out many such routes.\nThere are at least two ways of understanding the Indian claims about the nature of \u0026lsquo;reality\u0026rsquo;. One is to say that these traditions are providing descriptions of the world. Your references to Krishna and the Gita exemplify this interpretation. I do not buy this if for no other reason than the fact that, in such a case, I need to reject all the natural sciences in return for a bald (not bold) claim about the reality. If Krishna says what you claim to be the case, then Krishna\u0026rsquo;s statements are absolutely false. (I really cannot understand how you see an \u0026lsquo;absolutely true\u0026rsquo; statement there.) If on top of it, you say that this is \u0026lsquo;religious\u0026rsquo;, I am left wondering what you are talking about. Even if we restrict ourselves to the sentences you have cited from \u0026lsquo;The heathen \u0026hellip;\u0026rsquo;, you cannot advance such claims. Krishna\u0026rsquo;s message is not unconditionally accessible. The last statement is easily demonstrated by raising an interpretative problem: Who is the \u0026lsquo;I\u0026rsquo; in Krishna\u0026rsquo;s message? If you are a Buddhist, Jain, or a Saivite (using these words without problems in the context of this post), then Krishna is making either a false statement or a nonsensical one. How can you attribute unconditional accessibility and unconditional truth to this statement? Understanding Krishna\u0026rsquo;s statement depends upon the truth of some other antecedent beliefs we hold about the world; such is not the case with Religion.\nThe other way of understanding Gita is to go further in an entirely different direction. \u0026lsquo;How to speak for the Indian traditions\u0026rsquo; merely charts the territory to cover; it is not itself an alternate interpretation. But it is sufficiently worked out to tell us that an alternate interpretation is possible.\nThere is another thing that disturbs me about your post. Because I am not sure how to articulate this problem, let me try an initial formulation. One of the \u0026lsquo;achievements\u0026rsquo; of Indology (and the failed Oriental renaissance in the West) is that it has transformed aspects of the Indian traditions into esoteric quests. It appears to me that you merely go further in this direction but that you want to provide a \u0026lsquo;scientific\u0026rsquo; gloss. This is the bane of most (if not all) \u0026lsquo;Hindu\u0026rsquo; intellectuals and swami\u0026rsquo;s. Making the Indian traditions \u0026lsquo;respectable\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;relevant\u0026rsquo; to the twenty-first century seems to consists of using pseudo-scientific jargon and/or some banal and ill-digested philosophy borrowed from the western intellectual traditions. My attitude is the following: I am not willing to begin by assuming either the truth or the relevance of the Indian traditions. If I value the Indian traditions, then that is because its questions and quests survive the sharpest scrutiny our scientific knowledge provides. Either we are able to reformulate the questions and the answers of the Indian traditions in the languages of the twenty-first century and test them for both truth and relevance or we just give up. I am not willing to buy the Indian stories as \u0026rsquo;true descriptions\u0026rsquo; of the world. They are not that today; they have never been that yesterday either. I do not want an Indian \u0026lsquo;parapsychologist\u0026rsquo; to explain the \u0026rsquo;truth\u0026rsquo; of Indian psychology: this is the best way to damn Indian psychology forever. Let the Indian psychology (if there is one) compete with the best theories we have from the cognitive sciences. Only after such a competition, let us entertain claims about the \u0026lsquo;scientificity\u0026rsquo; of Indian psychology. Simply trying to dress Patanjali up in modern garb or refer to the \u0026lsquo;Yoga industry\u0026rsquo; in the US and elsewhere (as though this makes for a scientific psychology) will not get us any intellectual mileage. This is the best way for the Indian traditions to commit suicide.\n","tags":[],"title":"Achievements of Indology: Esoteric Indian traditions","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/achievements-of-indology-esoteric-indian-traditions/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","proselytization","secularization","vibrancy","explanatorily intelligible"],"content":" Why did Christianity become a \u0026lsquo;universal\u0026rsquo; religion? How did Christians replace the \u0026lsquo;chosen\u0026rsquo; people? What was the logic behind the transformation of the Jewish god into God of the humankind? In the literature on the subject that I have read, the first two questions get a historical (semi-psychological) answer. Traces of this answer can also be found between the lines in \u0026lsquo;The Heathen…\u0026rsquo;. There is a great deal of theological discussion on the third issue but I have not followed them.\nAre these questions important? Extremely. Should we seek to decipher the logic behind the mutation of Judaism into Christianity or is this process not a mutation but a mere transformation of Judaism? That is to say, is Christianity a solution of sorts to some or another dilemma of Judaism (Sankrant identifies the tension in the notion of Jewish god) or is the emergence of Christianity to be solely located in the response of the Judaic communities? The issue needs a bit of unraveling before it can be tackled properly.\nI claim that religion exhibits the double dynamic and every entity that is a religion should obey this. But the motor of the double dynamic is different for each religion and for Christianity it is the Christological dilemma. The messianic doctrine in Judaism is not a dilemma to Judaism because it does not claim a universal scope. The same becomes a dilemma to Christianity because it is forced to become \u0026lsquo;universal\u0026rsquo;. In other words, the Christ figure is a problem to Christianity because of what it is forced to do with the messiah of Judaism. In this sense, depending on what we focus upon (in this case) Christianity either continues the Judaic religion (the doctrine of the messiah) or breaks with it (because of how it looks at the messianic figure).\nWhile it is true that religion universalizes itself through the processes of evangelization and secularization, there is an empirical problem regarding these two processes. (Since I have tackled this question at length in one of my earlier posts, I will be brief here.) We need to keep in mind that the process of universalization of religion is tied to the extended reproduction of religion. In the book, I identify another mode of reproduction of religion (the simple reproduction of religion) and focus there only on one type of the extended reproduction, namely expanding in space (geography), people (the conversion of members from elsewhere), and domains (more and more aspects of human existence come under the sway of religion).\nThere is, however, at least one other mode of extended reproduction of religion that we empirically know of. Instead of expanding horizontally, some or another religion expands vertically (\u0026lsquo;horizontal\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;vertical\u0026rsquo; are merely convenient images). That is to say, while it looks from the outside that there is a mere simple reproduction of religion (there is no horizontal expansion of religion; the EI account merely continues to make the Cosmos explanatorily intelligible to those to whom it is the case), the religion in question is obeying the dynamic of extended reproduction of religion. It looks like simple reproduction because the secularization process appears muted and the religion in question does not evangelize. However, this is merely an appearance: because the religion inducts members from new generations (the children), it evangelizes them; it also brings more and more spheres of their existence – novel and unanticipated developments in society – under the sway of religion and hence it secularizes itself as well. (One could say that all living religions know extended reproduction of religion and that the notion of a simple reproduction is a theoretical construct that enables us to get synchronic snapshot of the structure of religion.)\nIt is a matter of historical contingency (I think) as to which kind of extended reproductive dynamic a religion is subject to. It is my hypothesis that when a religion confronts a vibrant pagan milieu, then it is forced, as it were, to expand by taking the form of an apparently simple reproduction of religion. This happened to Judaism in Rome; a similar fate would have befallen Christianity too (for the first three hundred years, this is how Christianity lived in the Pagan culture that Rome was). I think that is what happened to Islam and Christianity in India as well. (That is also why I think that a revitalization of the Indian traditions is the only answer to the problem of conversion in India. But this is a different issue altogether.)\nEven though it is a question of historical contingency that Constantine founded Constantinople and thus laid the basis for the Byzantine Empire, moving away from Rome was crucial for the horizontal expansion of Christianity. (It took nearly another six hundred years to remove all vestiges of paganism from Rome.) Such luck has never accompanied Judaism: it has always been forced to reproduce itself in its apparently simple form. (There is some proof, though, that it did evangelise in the Roman Empire, but it did so analogous to the way the cults expanded there.)\nNow is the time to pick up Sankrant\u0026rsquo;s thoughts by reformulating them. Is it possible for religion to reproduce itself indefinitely in a simple form, which hides its extended reproduction? Or is there something to religion that compels it to expand horizontally as well? Even though Constantine is a historically contingent figure, would the nature of Christianity (as a religion) sooner or later have required a Constantine? In this sense, is a Jewish state (though contingently founded only after the Second World War) inevitable?\nAn EI account cannot be restricted by time, space, or ideational clothes. The message must also be unconditionally accessible because its truth does not depend upon the truth of any piece of knowledge that human beings produce. Judaism is both an EI account and, at the same time, restricts access to its message. It claims that the Cosmos is explanatorily intelligible (therefore, it makes unconditional truth claim about all that was, is, and shall be) and that all other \u0026lsquo;competing accounts\u0026rsquo; are false. At the same time, it explicitly denies that this truth is accessible to all. Not only that. It says that `others\u0026rsquo; are necessarily forced to access only falsehoods. That is to say, only on the condition that others necessarily access only falsehoods is this EI account true. Judaism is the unconditional truth about the world if and only if it is only conditionally true. (That condition is that others are not only false but also that they cannot ever access the Truth.) The god of the Jews is God if and only if other gods exist and they are false. The \u0026lsquo;other gods\u0026rsquo; are the creatures of God; the latter is what He is (i.e. the unconditioned God) unconditionally. At the same time He is God, if and only if His existence is conditioned by the existence of other, false gods. The Jewish god is God if and only if he is not the Unconditioned God.\nIf this is the case, the Jewish theology (with the notion of an \u0026lsquo;inconsistent God\u0026rsquo; as its centre piece) would help us figure out (a) Judaism as an EI better; (b) relate the emergence of Christianity to Judaism; (c) answer some of the questions raised earlier in this post. One of the empirical issues of great significance to us is to trace the history of the several notions of `god\u0026rsquo; as they evolved in the Jewish theologies. Is this inconsistency a result of the internalization of the nature and notion of traditions, i.e., is this how Jews incorporated the nature of the pagan milieu they lived in as the motor of their own religion? Or is this a purely internal development of Judaism itself?\nOnce we have some such history of the motor of Judaism, only then, could we tackle the issue of \u0026lsquo;genericization\u0026rsquo;. However, I think that Sankrant is on a very interesting track. It appears to open up very exciting and fascinating areas of investigation that will help us understand the nature of religion better. My suggestion to Sankrant (and to others who feel like it) is to pursue this track. You need to delve deeper into the history of early Judaism, its theologies, and make yourselves very familiar with the early Christianity. I personally think that Sankrant\u0026rsquo;s suggestion is the best I have come across so far for us to start tackling the nature of Judaism and the questions about its nature as a religion.\n","tags":[],"title":"Extended reproduction of religion and revitalization of Indian traditions","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/horizontal-and-vertical-extended-reproduction-of-religion-and-revitalization-of-indian-traditions/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","proselytization","secularization","explanatorily intelligible"],"content":" Let us begin with the idea that religion is some kind of a system (or structure or whatever you feel like using) that maintains itself. That is to say, it is able to reproduce itself, and sustain itself. I call this the `simple reproduction\u0026rsquo; of religion. This dynamic enables not only the reproduction of the community of believers but also the experiential intelligibility that the Cosmos has for them. (Worship, for instance, is one such means for the reproduction of religion.)\nThere is, in addition, the dynamic of religion that allows it to expand. I call this the extended reproduction of religion'. Here, we need to ascertain (through research) what exactly this expansion\u0026rsquo; entails. At the moment, there are several candidates that partially fill in the meaning of the word: increasing number of people being converted to a specific religion; religion penetrating the daily life ever deeper; the expansion of some religion beyond the spatial borders that it finds itself, etc.\nOur common-sense notions of expansion' include the above elements. Mostly, that is all what is meant when one speaks of the expansion of religion. Because of this, the opposite processes are called the processes of secularisation. When, for instance, religion (basically the religious figures) starts losing out, i.e., wins less converts (or even none at all); when religion begins to withdraw\u0026rsquo; from daily life (and becomes a private matter', say); or it fails to spread, etc. people speak of the process of secularisation. Reformulating the common-sense notion, we could say that the withdrawal\u0026rsquo; of religion from spheres where it was explicitly present before indicates that secularisation is occurring.\nMy story does not deny the manifest fact that this process has either occurred or that it continues to do so. But I do claim that this is another way of how religion expands. That is, I suggest that secularisation is one of the moments in the expanding dynamic of religion. Secularisation and proselytization constitute two moments in the expansion of religion or, as I call it, they represent the double dynamic of religion.\nWhat does this dynamic do? It creates a religious world and a secularised religious world. The previous sentence must be understood literally: two worlds are created within religion. It is not a question of whether this or that theologian draws the distinction between the sacred' and the profane\u0026rsquo; or between the spiritual' and the temporal\u0026rsquo;, but about the coming-into-being of two worlds: the world of religion and the world of human beings. The latter includes Law, State, cemeteries, child-rearing practices, working as a computer engineer, building cars, setting up factories, designing and building cities. The world of religion is, of course, the world of God\u0026rsquo;s Will, His creations, His creatures. That means, it necessarily includes the secular world'. That is to say, the secular\u0026rsquo; world of ours is how the religious world brings it forth, as a secularised religious world.\nThis is a hypothesis formulated in the most general of terms. Through research, we need to give more precise content to this story: is it possible, for instance, to look at our modern-day cities as parts of a secularised religious world? How can we show that child-rearing practices of Europe (today) are expressions of the secularisation of some religion or another? And so on. In other words, we need to know what the hypothesis about universalisation of religion entails and what it does not. All I can say at the current moment is this: my hypothesis is proving extraordinarily productive in that it has enabled some of us to formulate very surprising questions for scientific research. Does it prove that my hypothesis is true? It does not; it merely indicates that my hypothesis appears heuristically productive.\nWith these preliminaries out of the way, let me now take up some of the issues you raise. About Judaism. Your questions arise from the fact that, for all practical purposes, one can only be born a Jew today (from mother\u0026rsquo;s side). This indeed appears to be true. But what does this fact signify? That the proselytizing tendency in Judaism is muted or non-existent today? We could answer this question in the affirmative only if we say that proselytization can only mean that it wins new converts. If we do that, what do we do with every new generation born of Jewish mothers? Further, we would be looking a proselytization in numerical terms, whose limits are given beforehand: the total number of human beings existing at any given moment. In that case, the proselytizing dynamic would cease once this limit is reached. Not only would that mean that proselytization means some initiation ceremony (baptism or circumcision or whatever else), it can also mean no more than that. Should this be the case, our claims would be historically inaccurate and wrong: (a) the Jews have always looked at themselves as the chosen' people, suggesting that there would always be gentiles\u0026rsquo; (or non-Jews) in the world. The God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob was the Lord of Israel, and there were other nations (people) and other gods' besides Him. (b) Even in Christianity, conversion\u0026rsquo; was a process that primarily monks and secondarily Christians underwent. To undergo `conversio\u0026rsquo;, one had to be a Christian first.\nAll of these considerations tell us this: we need to understand what the process of proselytization entails. To do this, we need to do research. My hypothesis enables us to formulate questions for a scientific enquiry and search for answers. It is itself not an answer to these questions.\nThere are other kinds of questions as well. Assume for a moment that there is a simple reproduction of religion. Would a deepening of the religiosity of its believers constitute the extended reproduction of religion as well? Could the extended dynamic be muted, dulled, or even rendered non-existent by other things? Could a religion reproduce itself indefinitely only in the form of a simple reproduction? How would we then look at the issue synchronically, i.e. when a new generation is inducted? So on and so forth.\nIn other words, to your question, \u0026ldquo;where can the dynamic of proselytization in the Jewish religion be found?\u0026rdquo; there is but one answer: through a study of the history of the growth, spread and the reproduction of Judaism, one can find out where it can be found and what proselytization of Judiasm entails. This will help us understand the notion of proselytization itself better.\nAbout the issues regarding Islam. You can, I suppose, already anticipate one answer. One needs to study Islam before your question can be answered. But there are other things to consider as well. The creation of a religious world and a secularised religious world occurs within a culture. So, if we have to understand this process (or even find out whether such a process is possible) we need to develop an empirical theory of a culture brought forth by Islam. Our newspaper conception of `countries in the Middle East\u0026rsquo; does not constitute a configuration of learning, which is how I see cultures. We need to look at the Mogul period (in India, for instance) and ask ourselves whether it was (or was not) in some way a part of the configuration of learning that Islam brought forth. How about Indonesia today? And soon. Only if we have some idea of this configuration of learning (which will not come without serious research) could we then see whether or not there is secularisation of Islam (as I use the term). My story cannot and does not answer these questions. But it does say that this process must exist in Islam (and Judaism) too and helps you in looking for answers. If this process does not exist, there are only two possibilities: either Islam (or Judaism) is not a religion or that my theory is false.\nYou further refer to some thinker who seems to suggest that the Islamic theology does not (or is unable) to make a distinction between the religious' and the non-religious\u0026rsquo;. That is, Islamic theology creates difficulties for the secularisation of Islam. I am not sure I understand what exactly this claim means.\nConsider the strictures against money-lending in Islam. Let us call them the religious' aspect of Islamic theology. However, there are banks everywhere in the Islamic countries and these banks participate in the international money-markets elsewhere in the world as well. Whatever the variations in the national banking practices, they are subject to international banking practices as well, which include charging interest on money. Do these banks belong to the religious\u0026rsquo; or to the non-religious\u0026rsquo; domain? Islam does not have anything to say about electricity, aeroplanes and petroleum. Do these objects and phenomenon belong to the `religious\u0026rsquo; domain or to something differentfrom it? Once you start along these lines, you have sciences, engineering, etc. about which Islamic theology will have nothing to say. To which domain do these things belong?\n","tags":[],"title":"The dynamic of religion: secularization and proselytization","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/the-dynamic-of-religion-secularization-and-proselytization/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","normative"],"content":" Assume that India (or any other society) does not have an ethics.

Subsequently, after having some story about how injunctions, rules, etiquette, etc. also have the same binding or compelling force, you can try to say that they also share \u0026lsquo;something\u0026rsquo; of the \u0026lsquo;moral ought\u0026rsquo;. Until one can argue this, this reference to language use cuts no ice. It must be obvious why: while jumping down from a height, one also experiences a \u0026ldquo;binding and compelling force\u0026rdquo;, namely, the gravitational force. That does not suffice to make this force into a moral force analogous to the \u0026lsquo;moral ought\u0026rsquo;, does it?\nCalling Western ethics \u0026rsquo;normative\u0026rsquo;\nIs there a problem in temporarily reserving the term \u0026rsquo;normative\u0026rsquo; to the western ethics alone? It might not have been a problem, if the challenge did not consist of precisely the thesis that suggests that one of the distinctions between the Indian ethics and the Western morality has to do with the \u0026lsquo;moral ought\u0026rsquo;. So, one of the proponents in the debate will have to \u0026lsquo;prove\u0026rsquo; that the Indian ethics is also (or not at all) normative in nature\nPatanjali\nIt is not sufficient that Patanjali says that some rules are to be followed regardless of jati, country, time or social conventions to make it into a moral obligation: he requires to say that these rules \u0026lsquo;ought\u0026rsquo; (a moral ought) to be followed. This moral \u0026lsquo;ought\u0026rsquo; has logical properties, which deontic logics investigate. One could say that \u0026lsquo;Hindu Ethics\u0026rsquo; ranks outcomes and thus make them appear on par with utilitarianism. But the utilitarian \u0026lsquo;ought\u0026rsquo; functions the way deontic logic makes us expect the \u0026lsquo;moral ought\u0026rsquo; behaves\nRules and Rule following\nThese articles could be talking about ‘rules’ (understood as ‘obligations’) and ‘rule following’: in that case, probably they are trying to get at the logical and semantic ideas underlying such obligations as ‘grammatical’ obligations (the obligation to follow rules of grammar), ‘legal’ obligations (the obligation to follow a statute), ‘traffic’ obligations (traffic rules that determine the behaviours of the driver) and such like. These ‘obligations’ could either be seen as generic obligations (of which ‘deontic’ obligations are a special case) or define deontic obligations differently altogether. The ‘deontic’ logics I know take the second route. I surmise that formalization of Mimasa would not (could not, in my story) give us deontic obligations of the type we get from Modal Theoretical Semantics (or from Model Theory, in general).\n","tags":[],"title":"Norm, utilitarian ought,  Patanjali","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/norm-utilitarian-ought-patanjali/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","normative"],"content":" There are other normative statements besides ethical ones: even aesthetic statements are normative (when you judge something to be ugly or beautiful) or statements about the presence of other values (say, \u0026rsquo;the meaning of life\u0026rsquo; questions). I have never denied it. As you rightly point out, legal norms are normative but they are not co-extensive with the ethical ones.\nIf there are standards to measure some entity or phenomenon and that such measurements are not \u0026ldquo;necessarily normative\u0026rdquo;, of course, you are right. We can say whether a car has been properly assembled by referring to the standards of putting the parts of the car together; we can say that rice has been adulterated or even that storm has a strength measured by the Beaufort scale. None of these is normative. I am not claiming that \u0026lsquo;all\u0026rsquo; measurements (or evaluations) are normative.\nAbout the use of words. \u0026lsquo;Normative\u0026rsquo; refers to judgments/sentences from natural languages that use norms. (In the case of ethics, which is what we discuss most often about, it refers to the \u0026lsquo;moral ought\u0026rsquo;; in case of law it is about the \u0026rsquo;legal ought\u0026rsquo;, in the case of aesthetics about the standard of aesthetic categories, and so on.) One distinguishes (in philosophy, for example) between \u0026lsquo;factual\u0026rsquo; and \u0026rsquo;normative\u0026rsquo; sentences, where statements from Natural Sciences (for instance) embody factual statements. Statements about \u0026lsquo;value\u0026rsquo; (valuational or axiological statements in general) exhibit other properties than factual statements. There is no consensus about the nature of \u0026lsquo;values\u0026rsquo;: some believe that they express something typically human, some think that they exist in the world quite independent of human beings, speaking only about the two ends of the spectrum. Between these two ends, there are many possible permutations and combinations.\nNormally, when I talk about the normative, I only have ethical judgments in mind.\nThere is a difference between evaluative statements and normative ones. Statements that ‘measure’ or ‘evaluate’ some or another phenomenon using a standard (even if it is a conventional standard) are evaluative in nature. Whether we speak about ‘winds attaining the force of X beaufort’ or about ‘the body temperature of a sick patient’ we are measuring phenomena. One could also evaluate the performance of a student in an examination or the share value of a corporation. These evaluations are not normative in nature. In other words, an evaluative statement is not necessarily normative in nature.\n","tags":[],"title":"The word ‘Normative’","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/the-word-normative/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","law","normative"],"content":"We need to tackle the following issues properly if we want to get a handle on normativity and its relation to a configuration of learning.\n1.1. Normativity cannot be the product of ethical learning. If it were that, say, by being a biological inheritance, then normative thinking would be the form of all ethics and my claim is that it is not so.\n1.2. Nevertheless, we need to explain the success of the normative mode of thinking. That is, almost all aspects of human existence appear susceptible to the process of \u0026rsquo;norming\u0026rsquo; and this process is also capable of expressing our ethical judgments about issues. This suggests that normativity exemplifies a \u0026lsquo;parasitic\u0026rsquo; behavior: it can infect different learning process and their products. Put differently: it is capable of piggybacking upon different learning processes.\n1.3. Normativity itself (i.e. the process of norming) must be the product of some or another learning process. Let us call that the ethical learning. It must, however, be the product of this learning process in a special set of circumstances. So, one possible hypothesis will go in the following direction: when ethical learning is exercised in the presence of some religion or another, the process of norming comes into existence. It can then spread deep and wide as long as the conditions that constitute (or define) the special set continue to exist or obtain.\n1.4. For norming to ride piggyback upon other learning processes, normativity must be indifferent to the content of the products of the learning processes. In other words, it must have a very formal characteristic. Yet, this formal characteristic ends up distorting the product of those learning processes it rides piggyback on.\n1.5. Subsequent to this, we can find out how and where it is located in the configuration of learning and the mechanisms of its reproduction. I do think that Law plays a very important role in the process of enabling normativity to ride piggyback or in enabling it to spread wide and deep. How it does this, is something I have some idea about but I need to give it more thought than I have given it so far.\nI think that deriving normativity directly from an EI account that religion is fails. In fact, because of this, it will become difficult to relate normativity to a configuration of learning. Religion and a normativity derived from it will have to shown to bring about a configuration of learning.

There is obviously something that bugs people, but I cannot make out what it is.\nFirst, about the counter evidence. If the Indian film censor board is a statutory body, then it derives its powers from the laws that have brought such an entity into being. Its tasks (viz. whether it is an advisory organ or can enforce its decisions, for instance) would be defined by the laws that govern such an entity and the same laws should also make it clear what \u0026lsquo;obscenity\u0026rsquo; is. (Assuming that such an entity has the task of censoring \u0026lsquo;obscenity\u0026rsquo;.) Establishing such an entity tells us something about the conceptions regarding the state and underlying such conceptions would be some normative doctrine about the relation between the state and citizens. (For instance it could be about the state guarding the \u0026lsquo;public morality\u0026rsquo; or the educative role of the state or whatever else.)\nEven if the Censor board functions as the \u0026lsquo;moral police\u0026rsquo;, this role is circumscribed and defined by the law. As such, they are stipulations made by the law-giver and the obligatory character of such stipulations has to do with the nature of laws and not with the nature of ethics.\nThere is only one way to recognize an ethical statement and that is by looking at its linguistic structure. Invariably, such statements make use of the word \u0026lsquo;ought\u0026rsquo;. This \u0026lsquo;ought\u0026rsquo; is the moral ought and we can recognize that it is a \u0026lsquo;moral ought\u0026rsquo; because of its logical and linguistic properties. Examples are many: one ought not to kill a fellow human being; one ought not to torture human beings; one ought to respect fellow human beings; and so on. These are the norms that \u0026lsquo;ought\u0026rsquo; to govern human conduct. The presence of such norms in a human community does not tell us anything about whether these norms also, in fact, do govern the behavior of the members of such a community.\nOne could always ask the question \u0026lsquo;why ought I follow such norms?\u0026rsquo; Answering this question is to answer questions either about the foundation of individual norms or about the foundation of ethics. There are many answers available about the foundation of ethics: from the answer that they are God\u0026rsquo;s commandments to the claim that we have biologically inherited them through the evolutionary process. Individual norms could be justified by referring to the consequences of following or not following such norms, or by reflecting about the nature of ethical rules or whatever else.\nThese norms, as their formulations make clear, are considered valid independent of time, place, culture and person. \u0026lsquo;One ought not to kill a fellow human being\u0026rsquo;, period. Because of their generality, application of such norms to the unique individual situations always require interpretations: what does \u0026rsquo;to kill\u0026rsquo; mean? Would the killing of, say, Hitler, when he was thirty years old, an immoral or a moral act? Or what does \u0026lsquo;respect\u0026rsquo; mean? etc. Such discussions are ethical discussions that involve evaluations of actions using some or another moral norm. Such discussions could make use of some or another theory about the nature and foundation of moral norms and thus might or might not justify the action, say, of killing Hitler when he was thirty years old.\nEven though we express such norms in some or another natural language, the claim is not that language is the foundation of moral norms. There exist many theories in the market place that explain the origin of moral norms: our \u0026lsquo;conscience\u0026rsquo;; God\u0026rsquo;s commandments; their usefulness to society; their consequences to the character of those who follow them\u0026hellip; Using such norms, one judges some or another action as either good or bad or morally neutral. Of course, as I said already, the general nature of these norms require interpretation whenever we have a unique action to judge.\nLet me formulate the above in the form of simple statements. Western ethics (both religious and secular ethics) makes the following claims. (a) Human beings formulate moral judgments; (b) These judgments are guided by criteria; (c) These criteria are moral norms; (d) Such norms, when formulated explicitly, make use of the \u0026lsquo;moral ought\u0026rsquo;; (e) These \u0026lsquo;oughts\u0026rsquo; have recognizable logical and linguistic properties; (f) Ethical discussions are mostly about the defensibility of such moral norms; (g) These norms are universalizable, i.e. they \u0026lsquo;ought\u0026rsquo; to hold independent of time, place, person, and culture.\nAlmost every English-educated Indian claims to understand the above 7 paragraphs. Many such people would also claim that these paragraphs are true. It is my suggestion that such people misunderstand the above paragraphs even though they claim the opposite. We are so profoundly bewitched by the western culture and so thoroughly insulated from our own culture that, when we put on the hat of intellectuals, we become ignorant of our own ignorance.\nLet me add a few more theorems I will be proving in my book:\n(a) Western normative ethics is a subset of Indian (Asian) non-normative thought;\n(b) Under special assumptions, and as a limiting condition, normative ethics is derivable from non-normative moral thinking. That is, Indian non-normative ethics is richer than the western normative ethics;\n(c) Western thinking claims that it is the nature of ethical thought to be normative. I prove the opposite.\n(d) Moral laws are assumed to hold universally. That is, it is supposed to be context, person, time, and person-independent. I show that this is not a linguistic or logical fact about ethical statements but a result of secularization of Christianity (and is compatible with Judaism and Islam).\nAnd so on.\n","tags":[],"title":"Normative Ethics III","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/normative-ethics-iii/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","normative"],"content":"X asks: I am unable to figure out what the special significance is of not having a \u0026lsquo;moral ought\u0026rsquo; in the Indian traditions. If \u0026lsquo;should not\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;must not\u0026rsquo; have the same practical consequences as \u0026lsquo;ought not\u0026rsquo;, that is we are obligated to behave in a certain way, why does it make a difference how it is expressed in our language?\nYour question is probably the best way of showing the difficulty we have with normative thinking. That is one of conceptualizing something called a normative ethical domain. Let us see if a simple (and simplistic) answer will help. Consider:\n(a) You should not play with fire if you do not want to get burnt.\nContrast this with the statement,\n(b) You ought not to torture fellow-human beings (if you want to remain a moral human being).\nRegarding (a): Is the statement valid if I wear a fire-proof suit, or I use a long non-conductive stick, or move a robot to do that using remote control? Of course not. You can play with fire and still not get burnt. In that case, this statement carries no force whatsoever. In even more simplistic terms, no \u0026lsquo;moral intuitions\u0026rsquo; are violated if you play with fire. (You can make the issue as complex as you want, but the point holds.)\nRegarding (b): this statement, we think, \u0026lsquo;ought\u0026rsquo; to be applicable to all people, at all times and in all circumstances. That is, we believe that this statement is universalizable.\nThe universalizability is one of the properties of moral statements and it remains valid even if it is empirically false (i.e. even if torture is a practice common across cultures and peoples). The validity of this statement is not affected by anything we do; it tells us what \u0026lsquo;ought not\u0026rsquo; to take place even if it does take place regularly. This distinction, between what \u0026lsquo;is\u0026rsquo; the case and what \u0026lsquo;ought\u0026rsquo; to be the case, distinguishes an empirical statement from a normative, ethical statement.\nHow do we justify a normative statement? There are many, many attempts and fragments of answers: one says that one justifies by appealing to consequences, others do not believe that this is the proper way provide a justification, and so on. Whatever the case, the point is that moral statements require a justification that typically appeals to some or another \u0026rsquo;norm\u0026rsquo; that we accept.\nThe problem with your question is that \u0026lsquo;should not\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;must not\u0026rsquo; do not have the same (logical) consequences as the \u0026lsquo;ought not\u0026rsquo;. You say they have the same \u0026ldquo;practical consequences\u0026rdquo;. Let us assume for a moment that it is so. If that is the case, one could violate the \u0026lsquo;should not\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;must not\u0026rsquo; statements without problems . Typical of normative statements is that one \u0026lsquo;ought not\u0026rsquo; to violate them, even if one does it regularly, in any circumstance whatsoever.\nHowever, if you believe that no such universalizable statements are forthcoming and that \u0026lsquo;should not\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;must not\u0026rsquo; can be violated depending upon the circumstances, then what you are claiming is that there is no ethical domain to talk about.\nThis is merely one aspect of the issue. There are many more. But they all suggest us this: if we think in Indian languages, then we cannot say what the \u0026rsquo;normative\u0026rsquo; ethical domain is, why one needs it, what significance it has, and so forth. Herein lies one of the reasons why the West called the Indians \u0026ldquo;immoral\u0026rdquo;. (That is, as a people who have no ethics at all.)\n","tags":[],"title":"Ought vs. should","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/ought-vs-should/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","law","normative"],"content":"Whenever I discuss the absence of normative ethics in India, people, especially Indians, get agitated. They hear me say that India has no ethics. Consequently, they want to show that I could never be right in my claim. This has happened on the Abhinavagupta forum as well.\nPerhaps, I should say that the Indian understanding of ethics is different from the western understanding. While this might prevent a knee-jerk reflex, it is not quite so informative.\nIf we want to test whether Indian ethics is normative in nature or not, a simple test is available. It is a linguistic test. However, to understand the significance of this test, one needs to know something about western ethics as well.\nIn all western theories of morality, a moral statement has the following characteristic logical and linguistic form: One \u0026lsquo;ought\u0026rsquo; to do something (i.e. one is \u0026lsquo;morally obliged\u0026rsquo; to do something); one \u0026lsquo;ought not\u0026rsquo; to do something (i.e. one is \u0026lsquo;morally forbidden\u0026rsquo; to do something); one might either do something or not do it (i.e. it is \u0026lsquo;morally permissible\u0026rsquo; to do something). Or, some action is either \u0026lsquo;morally obligatory\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;morally forbidden\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;morally permissible\u0026rsquo;. Put in compressed terms: a moral statement involves a norm expressed by the \u0026lsquo;moral ought\u0026rsquo;.\nConsider statements of the following nature: You \u0026lsquo;should not\u0026rsquo; do something; you \u0026lsquo;must not\u0026rsquo; do something; you \u0026rsquo;need not\u0026rsquo; do something; you \u0026lsquo;shall not\u0026rsquo; do something, etc. These kinds of statements do not express a moral norm, whatever else they express. In fact, in some contexts, one defends these statements by using a moral \u0026lsquo;ought\u0026rsquo;: (a) You cannot (or should not) simply go around killing people; (b) why not? (c) Because you \u0026lsquo;ought not\u0026rsquo; to kill people. Or again (a) you should not (or must not) torture people; (b) why not? (c) Because one \u0026lsquo;ought not\u0026rsquo; to torture people. And so on.\nIn other words, there is a difference between how \u0026lsquo;should not\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;must not\u0026rsquo; function (both logically and linguistically), and how the moral \u0026lsquo;ought\u0026rsquo; functions in statements.\nIn the course of the previous century, philosophers and logicians have spent a lot of effort and ink on understanding the way the \u0026lsquo;moral ought\u0026rsquo; behaves both logically and linguistically. There is a sub-branch of logic, called the \u0026ldquo;deontic logic\u0026rdquo;, which looks at the logical behavior of the \u0026lsquo;moral ought\u0026rsquo;. These logics analyze the meaning of the \u0026lsquo;moral ought\u0026rsquo; by looking at the derivable moral theorems. For instance, it is capable of answering the question \u0026ldquo;Does \u0026lsquo;ought\u0026rsquo; imply \u0026lsquo;can\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;? That is, if something is morally obligatory, does it imply that one can also fulfill the obligation? And so on.\nIn very simple terms, what we know today about ethics tells us the following: there is a difference between obligations and forbiddances that are non-moral in nature, and those that are moral. One can specify what these differences are by saying which theorems are derivable by using the \u0026lsquo;moral ought\u0026rsquo;. For example, legal obligations have a different force and character than moral obligations, even where such legal obligations are defended on moral grounds. (For instance, one might defend the legal obligation to pay taxes by ultimately appealing to the moral obligation that one \u0026lsquo;ought\u0026rsquo; to obey the sovereign.) One could also defend legal obligations by providing pragmatic justifications. For instance, the special prosecutor\u0026rsquo;s argument in indicting \u0026lsquo;Scooter\u0026rsquo; Libby was one such: truth is the engine of the justice system; Libby did not tell the truth; therefore, he hindered the functioning of the justice system. Hence the charge of obstruction of justice. Why should justice not be obstructed? In the process of answering this question, we enter the moral domain. However, the special prosecutor does not raise or answer this question and says that the law forbids it. As far as he is concerned, this is all that is required: contravention of the law.\nSo, if we want to argue for the existence of the \u0026lsquo;moral ought\u0026rsquo; in the Indian traditions (and thus show that normative ethics exists in India), then one should be able to point out the existence of a word which plays that role. Here is my challenge to those who claim that the Indian ethics is also normative: kindly show which word (in our languages) plays this role. It is all well and good to speak of the Mimamsa tradition or advice people to go and do ethnography in the villages, but these claims or advices do not constitute proof. It is my thesis that such a \u0026lsquo;moral ought\u0026rsquo; is absent in the Indian languages.\nOnce, while giving a talk at the JNU in Delhi, one of the students there (who also exhibited the knee-jerk reflex) came up with the following gem: in Hindi, he said, \u0026rsquo;tha\u0026rsquo; (as in \u0026lsquo;aapko aiyse nahi karna tha”\u0026rsquo;) is the \u0026lsquo;moral ought\u0026rsquo;. When I told him \u0026rsquo;tha\u0026rsquo; is the past tense of \u0026lsquo;hain\u0026rsquo; and that it is not equivalent to the \u0026lsquo;moral ought\u0026rsquo; (and asked him to prove that), he did not discuss any further. It is obvious that he was confusing the ethical force of that statement with a normative statement.\nThe claim I make is this: in none of the Indian languages (I know only a few), is it possible to distinguish (either logically or linguistically) between the following statements: you \u0026lsquo;must not\u0026rsquo; do something (in certain contexts, it also takes the form of you \u0026lsquo;should not\u0026rsquo; do something) and you \u0026lsquo;ought not\u0026rsquo; to do something. That is to say, our so-called ethical statements do not have a word that plays the role of the moral \u0026lsquo;ought\u0026rsquo;. If we had normative ethics, then our languages should contain a word that does what the moral `ought\u0026rsquo; does.\nAs I just said, I know only a few languages. People on this board know other languages. I would be grateful if someone could provide me with a word that exhibits the logical and linguistic properties that the \u0026lsquo;moral ought\u0026rsquo; has. Then my thesis is false, and I will not speak further about my book on ethics.\nOf course, my arguments about the nature of Indian ethics are not based on the mere absence of some words in the Indian languages. These absences are merely indices; they cannot and do not constitute proof on their own.\n","tags":[],"title":"Normative Ethics II","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/normative-ethics-ii/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","natural sciences"],"content":"My proposal addresses itself to the following observation: the natural sciences, as we know them today, arise in the western culture. What \u0026rsquo;natural sciences\u0026rsquo; mean in the above statement is clarified by other sentences that say, for example, \u0026rsquo;the rest of the world has accepted the western science and technology..\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;we need to learn science and technology form the west..\u0026rsquo; When we make these kinds of statements, what do we have in mind? Do we suggest that we need to learn some scientific formula from the west, or that we have to learn the proof of a theorem from the west? We do not. We are looking at sciences at a different level of abstraction. We are suggesting that there is a way of going about the world that we need to learn from the west. My hypothesis about science and religion is pitched at this level of abstraction. That is to say, I answer the following question: in which way is the growth of sciences a cultural phenomenon?\nIt is important not to confuse the differing levels of abstraction. My hypothesis is not about the discovery of laws of planetary motion or the laws of gravitation. It does not allow the following kind of question: by studying the 1905 paper of Einstein, could we identify his culture? (Hitler called it Jewish physics, and these kinds of answers are not my answers.)\nFormulate the following hypothetical question: If, say, a Newton or an Einstein were born in 900 AD, could they have formulated their scientific theories? Here is my answer: they might have written brilliant theological tracts but neither could have formulated their scientific theories for which they are known. Why? They lacked their predecessors and the (cognitive) social milieu required to raise the kind of research questions they did raise. Today, we do not have the faintest clue (except in very general terms) regarding how to go about answering this hypothetical question.\nHow to refute my hypothesis?\nWhat would falsify even this fragmentary hypothesis? I think it is not possible to be precise about this: should India or China (say) have developed (over centuries) a broad layer of intellectuals who carried out scientific research in the natural sciences (even if they took a parallel path), then there is something wrong with my hypothesis.\nEven here, there are many caveats. In my story, mathematics is tied to rituals; barring a catastrophe of unforeseen dimensions, doing sciences is a part of the western culture (that is why even events like the world wars did not destroy the sciences, whereas any such event would have snuffed out sciences if it was not a cultural phenomenon) and so on.\nLet us (counterfactually) suppose that we find Einsteins\u0026rsquo; theorem `proved\u0026rsquo; in an Indian tract. What does this fact disprove? That anyone, anytime could discover anything anywhere? That science is not cumulative in any sense of the term? That our ideas of scientific progress are wrong? That Balu\u0026rsquo;s hypothesis (which presupposes some answers to the above questions) is wrong? Falsification is not a simple matter, despite how it gets formulated. (That is what philosophies of sciences teach us.)\nOne of the tricks in doing scientific research is to identify the right depth (or abstraction) in formulating the questions and testing the answers. This ability comes (I think) only by doing research and not in any other fashion. One of the most fruitful ways of testing my research hypothesis is by developing it and seeing where (and why) it breaks down. At that stage, such a criticism will itself contribute to the development of a better hypothesis. Is this not what science is, in some sense of the term?\nSciences in the Antiquity\nWith respect to the Antiquity, the question is not about Archimedes or Euclid. We need to say that sciences there were also a cultural phenomenon. We do have the beginnings of scientific thinking there; but they were neither consistent nor did they spread in the culture. Consequently, we need a hypothesis that explains both the similarity and the dissimilarity with the natural sciences (as we know them through their histories) of today. No researcher anywhere in the world knows how to raise the issue of the origin of the natural sciences. Given this context, I claim that my fragmentary hypothesis is better than my competitors: the ancient Greeks had an unstable configuration of learning, where both performative and theoretical learning were competing with each other. There is evidence both for competition (read the discussions in Plato and Aristotle about the `Bards\u0026rsquo; or the story tellers); and for its instability (that is why the Greek culture disintegrated). This instability occurs because the Greeks did not have religion or rituals that bring about the configuration of learning. What my hypothesis does is to refocus our study of the Antiquity.\nIn other words, we need more than the presence of a book on Hydrostatics or Geometry before we can speak of natural sciences as a cultural phenomenon.\nHowever, this hypothesis about the antiquity is itself a derived one. My study is not about the Greeks. The very fact that one can test my hypothesis about the cultural differences between India and the west can be tested by looking at the ancient Greeks testifies to the scientific nature of my endeavor. I know of not a single anthropological theory that can be tested in this fashion.\nTheology and natural sciences\nI suggest that we look at the phenomenon of Natural Sciences as a product of the western culture. However, this does not carry the implication that the scientific theories in the domain of Natural Sciences are constrained by theological assumptions. Newton, as an individual scientist, did hold religious beliefs; they surely helped him in developing his theories. However, that does not imply that understanding, accepting or developing his theory requires that one also holds similar (or identical) beliefs about God, Man and Universe.\nKerala Mathematics\nFrom within my framework we cannot tell why Kerala, and not, say, Karnataka developed certain kind of Mathematics. But it should be possible to say why the Indian culture developed a Mathematics of a different kind than Newton. However, do not ask me to tell such a story. But I think it can be told. Before that, however, we need to come to grips with another question: how to write the history of cultures like India?\nIslam and Natural Sciences\nReligion generates a configuration of learning, which produces theoretical knowledge. It continuously reproduces this configuration of learning as well. That is to say, at every moment (in a manner of speaking), thanks to this configuration of learning, a revolution is possible that will (re)generate theoretical knowledge. Therefore, barring unforeseen catastrophes, as long as such a configuration of learning exists, the emergence of sciences is necessary (and will occur sooner or later). The more interesting problem for me is not the Antiquity but Islam. There was a period where scientific research flourished in the Arab countries, but it appears to have disappeared after some time. There is a lack of clarity (as far as I am concerned) regarding how to go about studying the Islamic culture. Is the Moghul India a part of the Islamic culture? Should we speak of an Arab culture or Middle Eastern culture and not of an Islamic one? What historical accidents can prevent the emergence of what is inherent in a configuration of learning? And so on. Ceteris paribus, sciences will emerge out of a configuration of learning generated by religion. Which cetera have to be paria in this case? I do not know.\nI wish I had the time to study Islam and its development.\nA configuration of learning also has the dynamic to reproduce itself. That is to say, besides being fed by the dynamic of religion (that enables sciences to emerge if they do not exist), the configuration of learning reproduces itself as well. However, the conditions under which knowledge production feeds itself are not (always) coextensive with the conditions under which such knowledge production is possible. What happens when the reproductive dynamic of the configuration of learning and of religion are not synchronized? What does it mean to speak of \u0026lsquo;synchronization\u0026rsquo; in this case? How can we decide about that? When could we say that they are out of step with each other? Again, I do not even know how to go about tackling these questions.\nThe problems in each of these cases, and in any number of other cases, are the same. I cannot appeal to accumulated knowledge. There are no received concepts and theories (in other domains) that can help me. I am forced to fashion new concepts and hypotheses in order to carry my research forward. There are billions of questions that require answering; the hypothesis I have is too elementary even to begin tackling them. All I can do is soldier on, and make do with what I have.\nThe origin of natural sciences is one of those billions of questions. All I have is a vague idea of the direction in which research should proceed. But doing research on this issue is a huge job: a task for generations (as history has shown) and not solvable by any one individual without the presence of appropriate concepts and theories from other domains. We do not have them today.\nIt is this situation, among others, that makes me believe that the so-called social sciences today are not sciences, whatever else they might be. If anything, they prevent the emergence of knowledge and insight into human beings, their cultures and societies. If you add the fads of contemporary intellectuals to this dismal state of knowledge, the situation is absolutely disastrous. It is almost as though every Tom, Dick and Harry is an \u0026rsquo;expert\u0026rsquo; on everything about human beings. One does not know what religion is, but there are any number of theories from evolutionary biology and evolutionary psychology that provide \u0026rsquo;evolutionary\u0026rsquo; answers to the origin of religion; one has not investigated ethics in different cultures, but biological and philosophical theories about their universality abound. We do not know what a \u0026lsquo;person\u0026rsquo; is, but why should that prevent Developmental psychology from analyzing\u0026rsquo; the development of personality? One could go on and on, but I trust the point is made. Add the fancy jargon of post-modernism, post-colonialism and such like to this situation, why, everyone knows what Hinduism is, caste is, Indian ethics is \u0026hellip; Only fools think that scientific research is required to provide knowledge.\nEvolutionary theory and Karma\nMan has inherited passions from his parents and ancestors, as well as from his prehuman forebears. The aggregate of all these effects constitutes karma.(p.125) Karma has been interpreted as the accumulation of one\u0026rsquo;s past actions, but perhaps \u0026lsquo;behavior\u0026rsquo; is a better term. (p. 123) Every action leaves ints influences upon ensuing actions. This present moment has inherited from all the past events that, without a single omission, have been handed down to us from countless cycles of existence.(p.122) Katuski Sekida\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Zen Training: methods and philosophy\u0026rdquo;\nThe more I think about Karma, the more I am convinced that this is how the Indians thought about the fact of genetic or even evolutionary inheritance. By saying this, I am not suggesting that we had ‘evolutionary’ theory before Darwin’s discoveries: we did not. But that, precisely, is the problem: why did more than a millennium of reflections about ‘facts’ of genetic inheritance not lead to something like evolutionary theory? This has something to do with how we approached genetic inheritance and how Darwin (and even Wallace) did. If this is the case, what is the difference between Indian questions and Darwin’s questions? Where do they diverge, how and why are they different, and what constitutes their difference? If we are able to tackle these issues properly, we will begin to get a better handle on the emergence of natural sciences in the West.\nConfiguration of Learning\nNo particular philosophy (of sciences) underlies \u0026rsquo;the scientific outlook\u0026rsquo;. In fact, our scientific theories allow multiple philosophies of science.\nWhat I claim is this. The origin of the natural sciences is tied to the configuration of learning that the western culture is. That is, what I call theoretical knowledge is what our natural sciences are. Partially in chapter 9, and then again in chapter 11, I take up this problem in more detail than I can in this reply.\nThe migration of scientific thinking across cultures has nothing to do with religion or its secularisation. Such a migration is possible because it is the result of a human learning process and the capacity to think that is present in human beings.\nThe origin is tied to a specific experience of the world: as that which is ordered, but one whose ordering is concealed beneath the phenomena. (See the 11th chapter.) This is merely a research hypothesis and not a theory about the origin of the natural sciences in the West. The virtue of this hypothesis, as against many others that exist in the market place, is that it retains the intuition that science is a cultural-specific product of the West. At the same time, by looking at the phenomenon of science as a cultural in nature, it does not trivialise scientific theorising by trying to find out the \u0026lsquo;cultural roots\u0026rsquo; (say) of the theory of Einstein.\nTo give this hypothesis flesh and bone requires a very detailed study into the western history. To do this, we need to first tackle the issue of how one conceptualises the western history as a cultural history of a configuration of learning. (In Jakob\u0026rsquo;s doctorate, some first steps are taken in this regard.\nIn other words, there is no way one could give satisfactory answers to your questions. My book provides one possible heuristic to carry out the research; but it is yet to be done.\n","tags":[],"title":"Religion and Origin of Natural Sciences","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/religion-and-origin-of-natural-sciences/"},{"categories":["Indian traditions","Jakob"],"content":" The absence of supernatural entities in the Indian traditions may seem counterintuitive to many. We can let someone else do the talking for us, namely Dale B. Martin in his interesting book Inventing Superstition: from the Hippocratics to the Christians (Harvard University Press, 2004): \u0026ldquo;One of the basic arguments of this book is that, contrary to many modern assumptions, the category of \u0026ldquo;the supernatural\u0026rdquo; did not exist in ancient culture as a category. Neither popular notions, held by the vast majority of inhabitants of the ancient world, nor philosophical notions (we could say \u0026ldquo;scientific\u0026rdquo; with due consideration for the possible anachronistic connotations of the term) assumed that reality was split up into two realms, one \u0026ldquo;natural,\u0026rdquo; containing things like \u0026ldquo;matter\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;natural forces\u0026rdquo; such as gravity or electricity, and another \u0026ldquo;supernatural,\u0026rdquo; to which gods and similar beings (demigods, angels, demons, ghosts) could be assigned\u0026hellip; What is important for this post is that the category was not available, either explicitly or by assumption, for persons in the classical Greek and Roman worlds. The Greeks and Romans certainly had no word that was equivalent to the modern English \u0026ldquo;supernatural.\u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip;I do not, however, want just to quibble about words. Classical Greeks and Latin had not term for what passes in the modern world as \u0026ldquo;the supernatural\u0026rdquo; precisely because the ancients did not separate out divine forces and beings from \u0026ldquo;nature\u0026rdquo; and relegate them to a separate ontological realm that could designated by its own label. Generally, for ancient people whatever does exist exists in \u0026ldquo;nature.\u0026rdquo; Almost without exception the Greek term physis (nature) refers to \u0026ldquo;all that is.\u0026rdquo; People might argue that the gods did not exist or that some particular daimon or god or superhuman being did not exist (I know of no ancient author who argued for actual atheism in the modern sense). But in that case, they said that the disputed entity simply did not exist, not that it might exist in some other realm of reality, such as the \u0026ldquo;supernatural.\u0026rdquo; Ancient philosophers might argue that lightning was not caused by a god, but they did not do so by pointing out that lightning occurs in the \u0026ldquo;natural\u0026rdquo; realm and that the gods exist in the \u0026ldquo;supernatural\u0026rdquo; realm and that the two realms are not supposed to interact with one another. Ancient people took the gods and all other beings we would think of as \u0026ldquo;supernatural\u0026rdquo; to be part of nature if they existed at all.\u0026rdquo; (pp. 13-15)\nAll these points are also valid for the Indian traditions. They do not split up the world into two realms, natural and supernatural. Nature to them is all that is. The devatas, rakshasas, and other special beings do not exist in some ontologically separate realm: whatever exists exists in \u0026rsquo;nature\u0026rsquo;. It does not even make sense to discuss the question as to whether Brahman is \u0026rsquo;natural\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;supernatural\u0026rsquo;. Brahman is present in nature, but since there is no such ontological division between two realms, it is superfluous to state this explicitly.\nInterestingly, the question as to whether Brahman is \u0026rsquo;natural\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;supernatural\u0026rsquo; does indicate where this terminology comes from and why the question was raised at all. It is part of the Christian theological critique of \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; as false religion. From the eighteenth century onwards, the \u0026lsquo;Indian religion\u0026rsquo; was dismissed as a form of \u0026lsquo;pantheism\u0026rsquo; whose doctrine claimed that God is nature. The concept of Brahman was viewed as an expression of the equation of God with nature. This image of \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; as \u0026lsquo;pantheism\u0026rsquo; emerged against the background of centuries of debate on Spinoza\u0026rsquo;s philosophy. Christian theologians and orthodox philosophers had accused Spinoza of being a pantheist because he claimed that \u0026ldquo;Deus sive natura\u0026rdquo; (God and nature are interchangeable). Pantheism, of course, was a heresy for Christians. Spinoza\u0026rsquo;s philosophy became extremely influential among European philosophers in the 18th century. In Germany, in particular, a controversy on pantheism divided the intellectual world in the late 18th century, the so-called Pantheismusstreit. This controversy shaped the German Indology of the early nineteenth century and its argument that Indian religion was also \u0026lsquo;pantheism\u0026rsquo; as opposed to the theism of Christianity. In Hinduism, there was no conception of a supernatural God who had created and commanded human beings but only a conception of \u0026lsquo;Brahman\u0026rsquo; or \u0026rsquo;nature = God\u0026rsquo;, the Indologists and philosophers said, and therefore Hindus had no sense of duty and no morality (see the interesting analysis of this episode in Arvind-Pal Mandair\u0026rsquo;s Religion and the Specter of the West (Columbia University Press, 2010)).\nPredictably, this Christian critique of the heathen religion of India gave rise to another position, which intended to argue that Hinduism was not pantheism at all but also a proper form of theism. There was \u0026lsquo;a supernatural God\u0026rsquo; in Hinduism, other scholars argued, but He had been forgotten by the populace. This claim used the same concepts of Christian theology, but tried to give a positive valuation to the \u0026lsquo;pure monotheistic Hinduism\u0026rsquo;. Not surprisingly, the educated \u0026lsquo;Hindus\u0026rsquo; of the 19th century reproduced this alternative Christian-theological position because it allowed them to \u0026lsquo;defend\u0026rsquo; their religion against the onslaught of missionaries and civilizing colonials. Without understanding what this meant, these educated Hindus began to insist that their religion did have the \u0026lsquo;supernatural\u0026rsquo; and was not a form of pantheism, and that therefore Hindus could also be moral beings.\nIt is against this background that we have to understand the fact that some educated Indians of today feel so strongly about insisting that their \u0026lsquo;religion does also have supernatural entities\u0026rsquo;. But these people should be aware that they are simply reproducing the language of one of the Christian-theological judgments about their traditions. The term \u0026lsquo;supernatural\u0026rsquo; - as Dale Martin makes it very clear - does not make sense without assuming the division of the world into two ontologically separate realms. This division is central to the Christian theological view of the world: there is the eternal, spiritual, supernatural realm as opposed to the temporal, material, natural realm. God, the angels and our souls exist in the first realm, while our bodies exist in the second realm. This theological framework determined how Christian Europe looked at other cultures. They were fit into this framework as pale and erring variants of Christianity. Hinduism also had awareness of the true supernatural God, the \u0026lsquo;open-minded\u0026rsquo; Indologists said, but this awareness had degenerated into imagining all kinds of \u0026lsquo;supernatural beings\u0026rsquo;. In other words, the people who feel they have to insist that \u0026ldquo;Hinduism does know of supernatural entities\u0026rdquo; should become aware of the implications of what they are actually saying: \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; is nothing but a degenerate form of Christian theism. ","tags":[],"title":"The absence of supernatural entities in Indian traditions","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/the-absence-of-supernatural-entities-in-indian-traditions/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","experience","psychology","explication"],"content":" Let us retain the translation of \u0026lsquo;Anu\u0026rsquo; as \u0026lsquo;appropriate\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;apt\u0026rsquo;. Let us emphasize the active dimension of the word \u0026lsquo;Bhava\u0026rsquo; to translate it as \u0026lsquo;coming into existence\u0026rsquo;. (\u0026lsquo;Existence\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;being\u0026rsquo; are also acceptable translations of the word \u0026lsquo;Bhava\u0026rsquo;.) Then \u0026lsquo;Anubhava\u0026rsquo; would mean an apt way of coming-into-existence. The problem here is this: we can ask the question, coming into existence of what? Of course, we can answer it easily by using hyphenation: it is not the coming-into-existence of any \u0026rsquo;thing\u0026rsquo; but coming-into \u0026rsquo;existence\u0026rsquo;. However, this might create more confusion than it solves. So, let us make a compromise here for the sake of clarity: coming-into-existence-of-being. We can also shorten it as coming-into-being, where we understand \u0026lsquo;being\u0026rsquo; as \u0026lsquo;origin\u0026rsquo;. We come into existence, we originate. In this sense, \u0026lsquo;Anubhava\u0026rsquo; talks about \u0026ldquo;an appropriate originating\u0026rdquo;. (This is all heavy-duty philosophy stuff, this is what \u0026lsquo;ontology\u0026rsquo; is, the \u0026lsquo;doctrine of being\u0026rsquo;.) As long as we keep these ideas in mind, we can say that \u0026lsquo;bhava\u0026rsquo; can be translated also as \u0026lsquo;being-there-in the world\u0026rsquo;, or as \u0026lsquo;being present in the world\u0026rsquo;. Thus, \u0026lsquo;anubhava\u0026rsquo;, or experience, is \u0026lsquo;being appropriately present in the world\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;being aptly present in the world\u0026rsquo;.\nThe \u0026lsquo;anu\u0026rsquo;, as it is used in the above formulation, does not use a standard to judge what is \u0026lsquo;apt\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;appropriate\u0026rsquo;. Any and every way of being present in the world is an apt way of being present in the world for that creature whose \u0026lsquo;being\u0026rsquo; is talked about. If we keep to this usage, then we have to say that all creatures have \u0026lsquo;anubhava\u0026rsquo; because every creature that \u0026rsquo;lives\u0026rsquo; also exists and all creatures that exist also exist \u0026lsquo;aptly\u0026rsquo; (i.e., they have their own ways of existing). Yes, this is true: all creatures experience (especially those with highly evolved nervous systems).\nLet me now switch my attention to human beings (who also, always, have experience in the above sense of the word) and signal this switching of attention by emphasizing the active dimension of \u0026lsquo;bhava\u0026rsquo; thus: bhava also means \u0026lsquo;becoming\u0026rsquo;. Thus anubhava, in this less generic sense, refers to an apt way of becoming. Becoming what? Whatever. This word emphasizes the process of \u0026lsquo;becoming\u0026rsquo;, whatever a creature \u0026lsquo;becomes\u0026rsquo;. In order to become (whatever you become), you have to go through the process of becoming. That is, you go through a process of transition from one state to another state. Anubhava, in this second sense, emphasizes this process of transition. So, to become a human being, one has to go through an \u0026lsquo;apt\u0026rsquo; process of transition. Such transition involves learning.\nFunctioning in the background to the second sense of anubhava is a vague sense of a standard. It is very unclear what it is to be a human being, but the word anubhava (here) indicates that, in so far as a process of learning is involved, one becomes a human being in some preferable way. Let us, not yet, seek the standard: let us simply say that anubhava here merely involves going through a process of learning that allows a human being to \u0026ldquo;deal with\u0026rdquo; all its senses: sense, sound, taste, thought, feeling and so on. What is apt here? Anything that allows you to deal with these senses. So, in this second sense, anubhava means learning to deal with your senses, no matter how you deal with them.\nThere is now a third sense of anubhava, where we can take one more step to explicate the meaning of anubhava by focusing on \u0026lsquo;anu\u0026rsquo; or aptness. The human being learns to deal with his senses aptly: apt in so far he deals with these senses rightly and apt in so far as his senses respond the right way to the world. (This is the \u0026lsquo;subjective\u0026rsquo; and the \u0026lsquo;objective\u0026rsquo; sense of aptness or appropriateness.) This is not merely a learning process but one which presupposes human communities: these communities will have generated multiple standards of aptness depending upon their understanding of both human beings and the world. (For example, anger makes you keep quiet, makes you shout, scold, and so on; even these vary depending upon whether you are a child or adult; and, even then, who is present with you and so on. This is how you learn to \u0026lsquo;deal with\u0026rsquo; anger, for instance.) The greater the varieties of \u0026lsquo;dealing with\u0026rsquo; senses you have learnt, the greater is your \u0026lsquo;anubhava\u0026rsquo; or experience.\nWhere does thinking about or reflecting on experience fit in? Through the process of thinking (and experimenting), you refine the way you deal with the raw material of your \u0026lsquo;anubahava\u0026rsquo; (or experience), which consist of thoughts, feelings, sensations, perception and so on. You become \u0026lsquo;more apt\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;more \u0026lsquo;appropriate\u0026rsquo;. As you learn to become more \u0026lsquo;anu\u0026rsquo;, your \u0026lsquo;bhava\u0026rsquo; changes too. You use \u0026lsquo;anubhava\u0026rsquo; to transform your subsequent anubhava: or experience helps you refine experience further.\nLet us postpone the question of what \u0026lsquo;anubhaava\u0026rsquo; consists of. For the moment, I hope this formulation avoids the problems that the words \u0026lsquo;stance\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;attitude\u0026rsquo; created.\n","tags":[],"title":"What is Anubhava? III","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/what-is-anubhava-iv/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","experience","psychology"],"content":"The biggest issue is: what is experience? All the Indian traditions have been busy with answering this question. But both posing this question and answering it are themselves experiential, as far as the Indian traditions are concerned. For instance, according to the so-called Buddhist traditions, the structures-in-experience are not given in the experience itself: the impermanence and transience of experience has to do with the realization that the description of the experience provides a sense of permanence because all descriptions of experience \u0026lsquo;create\u0026rsquo; structures. Here, it has to do with structures like \u0026lsquo;self\u0026rsquo;, specific emotions, and such like. But that does not mean that the Buddhist tradition says that our \u0026rsquo;experience\u0026rsquo; of a tree, or a stone or a car, etc. is illusory. That is, they do not say that the \u0026rsquo;experience\u0026rsquo; of the external world is an illusion.\nAccessing the truth of experience that in such an experience, there is no structure to be experienced (if I may put it in a simplistic way) does indeed constitute enlightenment, according to the Indian traditions.\nBut this entire issue, despite its absolute importance, is not the one I am addressing myself to in \u0026lsquo;The Heathen\u0026hellip;\u0026rsquo; (In \u0026ldquo;How to speak for Indian traditions: an agenda for the future\u0026rdquo;, I start investigating the issue of \u0026rsquo;experience\u0026rsquo; in the sense in which we speak of it in the Indian traditions, especially when we speak of enlightenment.) I hope to begin looking at this issue in one of my projected books. We need to have clarified many notions before we approach the notion of experience, especially if we want to talk intelligibly about the Indian traditions. Otherwise, we will repeat the foolish claims of generations of Indologists and specialists in the study of Indian \u0026lsquo;religions\u0026rsquo; that, for example, the advaitic tradition claims that the world is an illusion, i.e., the advaitins are made to say such foolish things as: \u0026rsquo;there is no difference between my experience of having an arm chopped off and drinking water when one is thirsty\u0026rsquo;, and such like. (How does one distinguish between the \u0026lsquo;illusion\u0026rsquo; of having an arm chopped off, and the \u0026lsquo;illusion\u0026rsquo; of drinking water when thirsty? What differentiates one illusion from another? Are there different \u0026lsquo;kinds\u0026rsquo; of illusion?)\nTo understand the claim in \u0026lsquo;The Heathen\u0026hellip;\u0026rsquo; about structuring experience, we should not problematize the notion of \u0026rsquo;experience\u0026rsquo;. We need to keep this notion steady and vague, the way we do it when we do other sciences, and when we are not studying experience itself.\n","tags":[],"title":"What is experience?

That is, we can experience the \u0026lsquo;inputs\u0026rsquo; of all our five senses. From this, it follows that experience cannot be identical to any of them. Experience might contain, as its elements, inputs from these five senses in the form of thoughts, feelings, sensations, etc. but it cannot be coextensive with any one of them.\nIf we take \u0026lsquo;anubhava\u0026rsquo; (not \u0026lsquo;anubhaava\u0026rsquo;) as a translation of the word \u0026rsquo;experience\u0026rsquo;, it suggests us that it involves \u0026ldquo;an awareness of a state-of-being-in-the-world.\u0026rdquo; This is not a definition but merely a circumscription of the word \u0026rsquo;experience\u0026rsquo;. (It is one of my claims that the western traditions have hardly investigated what \u0026rsquo;experience\u0026rsquo; is and that such an investigation is one of the primary concerns of all the Indian traditions I know.) So, when I speak of \u0026lsquo;ignorance\u0026rsquo; as something that prevents access to experiential knowledge (or speak about Indian traditions as transmitters of such an experiential knowledge), I have this circumscription of the word in mind. In such a case, I am trying to grasp in the language of the twenty-first century, what our predecessors were (probably) talking about.\nI am inclined to think that insights like those that our traditions have developed are profoundly true of human psychology as such. That is, if we forget that we are always cultural, social and individual beings, then these insights are about the basic structure of human psychology and thus apply to each one of us.\nHowever, it is not Maaya alone that prevents access to our experience: our culture, our society, our individual psychology are also impediments to accessing our experience. One such \u0026rsquo;external\u0026rsquo; factor is the processes induced by colonialism: it creates extra impediments by taking away from us our way(s) of accessing experience, leaving almost a vacuum in its place. This vacuum gets filled up by the way we look at Indian culture and her \u0026rsquo;texts\u0026rsquo;\u0026ndash; a way we learnt from the British. Now, there is a second impediment. These two impediments prevent access to our experience as well next to and alongside impediments like \u0026lsquo;maaya\u0026rsquo;.\nTo understand the Indian people of today, we need to (1) understand the general structure of human psychology; (2) the cultural psychology of the Indian culture; (3) the historical impacts of different colonialisms and so on. What I say in the note on colonial consciousness stands somewhere in the interface of (2) and (3); what I say in the other two pieces presupposes (2) and (3) \u0026ndash; that is why I want to formulate it in our language of this period \u0026ndash; but is about (1).\n","tags":[],"title":"What is experience?

So, \u0026lsquo;anubhava\u0026rsquo; would mean having an appropriate existence or even an appropriate way of being-in-the-world. Appropriate to what though? Appropriate to the things, events, and the people one meets in the world. So, \u0026rsquo;experience\u0026rsquo; means a way of being present in the world that is appropriate to whatever one encounters in the world. It is, if you like, \u0026lsquo;being-present-with\u0026rsquo;. This means that we need time: to discover ways that are appropriate to the different things we relate to in the world, we have to take our time to get to know them. That is to say, if one wants to experience the world, one has to take the time, have patience and be there. In short, \u0026rsquo;experience\u0026rsquo; indicates a stance or an attitude we assume in the world with respect to whatever we encounter (think, taste, perceive, hear, feel, touch) in the world. Experience, thus, includes sensations, perceptions, feelings, thoughts etc but is not co-extensive with any of them.\n1.2. This idea suggests further that we need to learn \u0026lsquo;how to experience\u0026rsquo;. You need to learn how to experience because this is not genetically programmed into us. It needs us to be receptive and open to the world and wait upon things and people. But neither this receptivity nor \u0026lsquo;waiting upon\u0026rsquo; is passive in nature: we have to learn to be rightly receptive and appropriately wait upon people (\u0026lsquo;anu\u0026rsquo;). Thus, learning to be a human being is also to learn how to experience. In one sense, we can now appreciate the fact that all human beings (and other biologically highly evolved organisms) would all have \u0026rsquo;experience\u0026rsquo; of the world. They have it in the sense that anyone who has feelings, sensations, etc would have also developed a stance or an attitude towards these and the world. In another sense, it also clarifies our sense that there are people who either have \u0026rsquo;little\u0026rsquo; experience or do not learn anything from experience or that we even have to think about experience.\n1.3. The last sense arises from the fact that the stance or attitude that one has evolved though one\u0026rsquo;s encounter with the world might not be the most appropriate or adequate way of dealing with what we encounter. A stance that you have learnt might help you get along with most things you routinely encounter in the world and, in this sense, might be adequate for you. You might even consider it \u0026lsquo;appropriate\u0026rsquo;. But the appropriateness depends not only on your ability to cope with things but also with the nature of things you encounter. That is to say, the \u0026lsquo;appropriateness\u0026rsquo; that we talk about incorporates two dimensions: (a) the subjective dimension that refers to what you consider appropriate; (b) the objective dimension that picks out the fact that the world is also objective in nature: it is your world only because it is `the world\u0026rsquo; as well.\n1.4. That is the reason why you have to think about \u0026rsquo;experience\u0026rsquo;. You modify it, channelize it, give form to it and fine-tune it in such a way that you really have an appropriate way of being-in-the-world, appropriate both in the subjective and objective sense of \u0026lsquo;anu\u0026rsquo;. This is a learning process and you have to be taught this process. The more you reflect about your experience, the more you shape it by thinking both about your stance in the world and the raw material of that stance (thoughts, sensations, feelings, etc) the more you progress towards the next stage: experiencing \u0026ldquo;happiness\u0026rdquo;, which, in some Indian traditions, is the result of having \u0026ldquo;anu-bhaava\u0026rdquo;, where \u0026ldquo;bhaava\u0026rdquo; is something akin to \u0026ldquo;feeling\u0026rdquo; (the English word is too shallow in in its meaning to capture the notion of \u0026lsquo;bhaavana\u0026rsquo;). However, I will not go into this aspect in this post.\nThis way of talking about experience allows us to make sense of having \u0026lsquo;a rich experience\u0026rsquo; and having a \u0026lsquo;complex experience\u0026rsquo;. It also suggests ways of \u0026rsquo;learning\u0026rsquo; through experience and tells us how \u0026rsquo;experience\u0026rsquo; teaches us things about the world and ourselves. There is no terminus to experience when it is seen as something that involves learning though the process of living-in-the-world.\n2.1. Having an appropriate existence-in-the-world is a way of \u0026lsquo;being\u0026rsquo; and not a question of performing an appropriate action. A \u0026lsquo;stance\u0026rsquo; or an attitude is not a way of thinking about the world either. It is not like assuming a stance or an attitude about \u0026lsquo;abortion\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;universal franchise\u0026rsquo;. Perhaps, my use of the word \u0026lsquo;attitude\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;stance\u0026rsquo; is the culprit here. I shall reformulate it soon.\n2.2. Both \u0026rsquo;experience\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;anubhava\u0026rsquo; indicate that they comprise of thoughts, feelings, sensations and perceptions. That is why, in one sense of the word, even higher biological organisms (not just human beings) have experience. Consequently, one cannot decide or not decide to \u0026lsquo;have\u0026rsquo; experience. (How can a human being \u0026lsquo;decide\u0026rsquo; to have a thought or feel the heat of burning coal?)\n2.3. Corresponding to this sense of the word, any creature that deals with sensation, perception, thought, feelings, etc has \u0026lsquo;an appropriate existence\u0026rsquo; or experience. Here, \u0026lsquo;dealing with\u0026rsquo; should not be taken as a deliberate action. When you feel sorrow, you cry and that is how you deal with sorrow; remove your hand hurriedly when it comes near burning coal and this is how you deal with its heat. You might say that \u0026lsquo;crying\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;removing your hand\u0026rsquo; are actions and you would be right. But you also deal with sensations, etc without performing any action: you may do nothing when you get angry or keep the sweets in your mouth longer to savor its taste or listen to music without doing anything. These too have to do with dealing with emotions, sensations, etc. In this sense, one does not have to \u0026rsquo;think about the world\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;perform a conscious action\u0026rsquo; to \u0026lsquo;have experience\u0026rsquo;.\n2.4. In the same sense of the word, one cannot choose or not to choose to \u0026lsquo;have experience\u0026rsquo;. Of course, one can choose not to have a particular experience (of drinking whisky, of going to the US and such like) but this is not the same as having experience as such.\n","tags":[],"title":"What is experience? II","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/what-is-experience-i/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","experience","Indian traditions"],"content":"According to your account, Vedanta claims that the world is an illusion and that only the Brahman is real.\nIf the world is an illusion, Vedanta has to deny the reality of the world. To it, in the way you construe Vedanta, the world is the empty set. That is to say, all experiences are on par because they are all illusions. One cannot distinguish between experiences unless one introduces the notion of a differentiated reality. From this, it follows that a vedantin should not be able to discriminate, say, between the following: the pain you have by stubbing your toe, the pain you have when your arm is cut off without anaesthesia, and the pain you feel when your loved one dies. If he does draw a distinction between them, he is distinguishing one illusion from the other and the only way of doing that is to ascribe to these illusions the status of reality: this is \u0026rsquo;less illusory\u0026rsquo; than… this is \u0026lsquo;more real\u0026rsquo; than… this \u0026lsquo;pains more than\u0026rsquo;… this pain is \u0026lsquo;different from\u0026rsquo;…and so on. If he does not distinguish, and insists there is no difference between falling in a lake and bumping his head against a tree, who would take him seriously? Do you believe that Indians are such cretins that they would simply accept such inane stories? Surely, if \u0026lsquo;Brahman\u0026rsquo; is all there is to Vedanta, all vedantins must be perfect imbeciles. In that case, we do not need heavy-duty tantric stuff to shoot them down; a simple dose of commonsense will do.\nShankara was a vedantin, as you know. If you had glanced at his writings, say his Mayapanchakam for example, you would have known that what you say does not make sense. In this poem, he describes the power of maya and ascribes agency to \u0026lsquo;her\u0026rsquo;. He speaks about those whom she spellbinds: they are a plurality of creatures including the learned, the human, the animal, and, of course, the Brahman. How could he talk about the \u0026lsquo;power\u0026rsquo; of maya, her incredible abilities to control creatures, if both maya and the plurality of these creatures and their experiences were not real? Maya makes sense only if the world and its richness are real. Maya does not imply the absence of the experiential world but presupposes its reality instead. To say that maya is the nature of reality makes sense. It is, however, linguistic nonsense to say that illusion is the nature of reality. How could the vedantins discuss with each other if they spouted semantic nonsense?\nIt is obvious where the problem is to be partially located. You translate \u0026lsquo;maya\u0026rsquo; as \u0026lsquo;illusion\u0026rsquo;. This translation does not work, when you are talking about one of the central categories that many Indian traditions use. To understand why it could not be a translation of maya, consider the following argument. After all, Vedanta claims that when one realises the unity of \u0026ldquo;oneself\u0026rdquo; and the \u0026ldquo;Brahman\u0026rdquo;, one achieves enlightenment. If \u0026rsquo;everyone\u0026rsquo;, except the enlightened, is under the sway of \u0026lsquo;illusion\u0026rsquo;, what causes it? Vedanta claims there are causes. If there are causes, they cannot be \u0026lsquo;illusionary\u0026rsquo; entities. If causes are real, so are their effects. \u0026lsquo;Illusion\u0026rsquo; is an effect. Therefore, \u0026lsquo;illusion\u0026rsquo; is also \u0026lsquo;real\u0026rsquo;. In that case, Vedanta would become flatly nonsensical. Whatever else Vedanta is, it is not semantic nonsense. Surely, one should understand what Vedanta denies and what it does not, before indulging in silly contrasts.\n","tags":[],"title":"Is maaya an illusion? Is maaya real?

If we could arrive at something approximating a consensus, we will have made a substantial headway. At the least, we can critically read the material on Hinduism with our answers to these questions.\nI suggest we begin with (a). To start the ball rolling, I will mention some possible kinds of evidence and formulate my problems with each of these possibilities. Anyone who feels inclined is welcome to join the building of the list at any point in time and add or delete depending on the arguments.\nMany (most, majority of the) Hindus believe in the existence of such an entity. Problem: We have known any number of instances where people have entertained false beliefs. Also, the existence of some phenomenon does not require that people believe in its existence. The conjunction of these two makes the beliefs (at best) weak evidence for the existence claim.\nThe above argument does not apply to social reality. The existence of a social or cultural phenomenon requires that we believe in its existence. For instance, if none believed in untouchability, it would cease to exist. Problem: one will have to show that the existence of Hinduism is something like untouchability and not, say, something like inflation or economic crises.\nMany people from other times and places have registered the use of the word \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; among Indians. Problem: Apart from a similar objection to (1), there is a weightier matter. None could have registered such a use because it is an English word and of recent origin.\nIf not \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo;, its equivalent has been registered. Problem: one has to demonstrate the equivalence first.\n\u0026lsquo;Hindu\u0026rsquo; (Yin Du for instance) is used by the Indians from a very early period. Problem: It is not clear whether the word refers to a people, a region or something else. However, using the word \u0026lsquo;Hindu\u0026rsquo; is not sufficient: one must derive this word from \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo;. That is, the usage must say that one is a Hindu because one belongs to Hinduism. Only then will the use become evidence. Then problems (1), (3) and (4) return with a vengeance.\nPeople have been studying it, talking about it. Problem: So did people talk about witches, their alleged intercourse with the Devil and Phlogiston. This is a variant of problem (1).\nIt unifies the Indian culture (or at least some part of it). Problem: while that could be the case, what evidence is there to accept that Hinduism is responsible for it? This answer presupposes as true what it tries to prove.\nMost of us can make a list of things we intuitively associate with the phenomenon of Hinduism. Problem: what happens when intuitions conflict? The first problem also recurs.\nBoth we, our grandmothers and, say, Shankaracharya would agree with a minimal list. Problem: this shows that there is \u0026lsquo;something\u0026rsquo; we all agree upon. How does this provide evidence for Hinduism? Problems (8) and (1) recur.\nThere are university courses, PhD programs and writers of repute writing on it. Problem: Similar things can be said of proof for the existence of God, parapsychology, and creationism.\nAmerican Hindus passionately believe in Hinduism. Problem: This could be traced to the impact of the Semitic religions on the American culture and the impact of the latter upon the Indians in America.\nHindutva would not be possible without Hinduism. Problem: Presupposes as true what requires proving. The burden of proof is the other way: one has to show that Hindutva comes into being because of Hinduism.\nComments Arun — 2013-06-02 22:21:00\nIs probably the most important on the list.

I say man because fewer women go for that kind of ascetic lifestyle.\nWhat has self-attainment to do with worshipping the deity (whether internal or external) in the Asian (or Indian) traditions? Except for what has been talked about the Bhakti tradition (especially by the European intellectuals, and picked up later on by the Indians), \u0026lsquo;self-attainment\u0026rsquo; stands radically divorced from any notion of deity \u0026ndash; as far as one can tell. The path of yoga (to stick to what this word refers to in the popular western consciousness) is different from that of meditation or bhakti, in the sense that the former focuses on control (as against \u0026rsquo;letting go\u0026rsquo; in the Buddhist traditions for instance). Renunciation, contrasting it to the \u0026rsquo;normal humdrum lifestyle\u0026rsquo;, is a pre-requisite primarily because this \u0026lsquo;attainment\u0026rsquo; (of \u0026lsquo;self\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;knowledge\u0026rsquo;, Mukti, or whatever) is predicated upon a meta-reflection (and a deep understanding) of the \u0026lsquo;humdrum\u0026rsquo; life. Such a reflection is cognitively impossible when you are involved (entangled would perhpas be a better word here) precisely in the very dynamic on which you have to reflect.\nX says: Like all higher learning and secret ritualistic practices of those days, women and Shudras were barred from either knowing or practicing the techniques\nDisappointing. Not because, rightly in my view, you complain about the position of either the Shudras or Women in Indian society, but because of the uncritical manner in which you make the \u0026lsquo;popular\u0026rsquo; discourse your own. Those coming from the Christian West, especially from the eighteenth century onwards, spoke of \u0026lsquo;secret ritualistic practices\u0026rsquo; because: (a) they were convinced that the \u0026lsquo;heathen\u0026rsquo; religions of India worshipped the Devil and his minions; (b) as such, its practitioners had hideous rituals as it befitted the False God whom they worshipped; and (c) that it was practiced in \u0026lsquo;secret\u0026rsquo;. Being the latter, almost as a matter of simple logic, it had to exclude; (d) and, of course, it had to exclude \u0026rsquo;the majority\u0026rsquo; (otherwise it cannot be secretive, can it?). Who qualifies for this \u0026lsquo;majority\u0026rsquo; you think? Of course the Women and the \u0026lsquo;other majority\u0026rsquo;, viz. the Shudras.\nNow this is trash: to say that Yoga did not have practicing women (during Patanjali\u0026rsquo;s time, for heaven\u0026rsquo;s sake) requires more than a mere complacent feminist extrapolation from contemporary India alone. It requires a kind of dumbfounding intelligence (that many intellectuals from the West apparently possess), which cites Dharmashastra to understand India or the Koran to understand the Arab countries, peoples and cultures.\nX says: The do it yourself form of Yoga cannot be done without proper guidance.\nRight. But this applies to all the Indian traditions (from Yoga through Bhakti to Meditative practices). Far more interesting it is to ask oneself \u0026lsquo;why\u0026rsquo;. Again, not in order to understand what Guru means (or does not) in these traditions, but to begin to come to grips with what this \u0026lsquo;self-attainement\u0026rsquo; is or could be. Your remarks about the \u0026lsquo;cash cow of the Hindus\u0026rsquo; cut deeper and wider than the scope of your words: it picks up (indiscriminately as it were) a Tibetan monk, a Japanese Zen master,\u0026hellip; But then, I am not sure about your intentions either.\nX says: The entire second chapter of Patanjali\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;yoga sutra,\u0026rdquo; deals with \u0026ldquo;saadhanapaadaH.\u0026rdquo; Which is to say \u0026ldquo;How to do it\u0026rdquo;.\nA better, more accurate and a faithful rendition would sound: \u0026rsquo;the path of assiduous practice\u0026rsquo;. All knowledge requires \u0026lsquo;saadhana\u0026rsquo;, which is more than assiduous practice. It connotes an order of skill which requires \u0026lsquo;mindful\u0026rsquo; practice as well.\nX says: Swamis and gurus hate as much as the defenders of Hindu faith to admit the sensual aspect of one\u0026rsquo;s body wherein a normal sexuality is considered as a bane for spiritual attainment.\nOnce again, yes and no. Yes: in the sense that any practitioner from some specific tradition finds that his (her) chosen path either forecloses or integrates other paths. This is true not just for the Swamis and the Gurus from the \u0026lsquo;Hindu faith\u0026rsquo; (did I not read a posting from you somewhere that denied the existence of the \u0026lsquo;Hindu Religion\u0026rsquo;?), but for all those Asian traditions that are different from and other than those who pursue the path of \u0026lsquo;self-attainment\u0026rsquo; through Sensuality. Some of the Tantric traditions follow the sexual path to \u0026lsquo;self-attainment\u0026rsquo; as well. In this sense, the answer is also no.\nX says: Yoga is a philosophy and like any other I know or heard of.\nThat is precisely the probable. The only \u0026lsquo;philosophies\u0026rsquo; one knows today are (a) either Western or (b) pale imitations of the West. One writes, as it were, for the imagined eyes and audience from the West. This has the effect of making the Asian (Indian) thinkers and practitioners appear downright stupid (at best) or mentally defective (at the worst). Which intelligent human being can possibly believe that the whole world is an illusion, maaya? one feels like asking. Were they really so dumb that they did not cognize the \u0026rsquo;existence\u0026rsquo; of the World? If yes, how come they went around talking about plurality of worlds, for god\u0026rsquo;s sake? It appears as though one has answers \u0026ndash; after all, one can either read the original works or texts in translations. The only problem is: we do not know what they are answers to. One needs to ask oneself this: Which were the questions these people tried to answer? Are they ours as well? If yes, translation please: into an understandable vocabulary from our own times, and addressing our concerns. Now, of course, one could also make them sound \u0026rsquo;esoteric\u0026rsquo; and \u0026rsquo;exotic\u0026rsquo;, much the same way the German Romantics did. Either way, the point and purpose get lost.\nX says: There is lot of junk in Sanskrit and Hindu philosophy and no definitive answers come by with literal translations or deep philosophical debate and discussions.\nAgain, yes and no. There is a lot of junk both from today and yesteryears, this part is true. No \u0026lsquo;definitive\u0026rsquo; answers? Yes: if you mean by \u0026lsquo;definitive\u0026rsquo;, that which is true for all time to come. The only one who can give such answers, according to the Judaic, Christian and Islamic religions anyway, is the personal being referred to as \u0026lsquo;God\u0026rsquo;. They agree too that \u0026rsquo;literal translations and deep philosophical debates and discussions\u0026rsquo; do not bring \u0026lsquo;definitive answers\u0026rsquo;, and that only revelation does. Tertullian, one of the early church fathers, summarized this thought in a rhetorical question: What has Athens to do with Jerusalem? Nothing, he said. \u0026ldquo;Our wisdom comes from the porch of Solomon\u0026rdquo;, and not from the Academy (referring to the Greek and Roman institutions of learning). Surely, you do not want to say this. At least, I do not. In this sense, the reply is a no as well: all answers (in so far as we search and hypothesize) are tentative, hypothetical, and provisional as it befits the beings who formulate them, viz., human beings. Human knowledge is fallible, and it is not infallible \u0026lsquo;divine knowledge\u0026rsquo;. So what? That is the only kind of knowledge we produce.\nl:unet4\n","tags":[],"title":"Yoga, shudras, and women","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/yoga-shudras-and-women/"},{"categories":["concept(category)","Jakob","secular"],"content":"While reading Shabnum Tejani\u0026rsquo;s *Indian Secularism: A Social and Intellectual History (*2008), I ran into the same weird point that Neera Chandhoke also tried to make at the RRI platform debate on secularism. This is a combination of the old claim that \u0026lsquo;secularism\u0026rsquo; has acquired a different meaning in India and a general theoretical point: \u0026lsquo;secularism does not have any essence or universal meaning, but gets different meanings dependent on the historical and cultural contexts in which it has developed\u0026rsquo;. There are different variations on this formulation, but the general point is one that is becoming increasingly popular (especially among historians), because of the influence of Talal Asad and other postmodernators. Hence, I wanted to try and address the point by taking the example of Tejani\u0026rsquo;s work.\nTejani argues that the binary opposition between \u0026lsquo;secularism\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;communalism\u0026rsquo; in the Indian debate is problematic. According to her, each position in the debate \u0026ldquo;reifies these categories: they share the premise that \u0026lsquo;secular\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;communal\u0026rsquo; have a meaning in themselves, one that transcends historical context.\u0026rdquo; She goes on: \u0026ldquo;The circularity of much of the contemporary debate has to do with the way in which secularism and communalism have been treated as hermetically sealed, universal categories. It is this that has allowed them to be locked in binary opposition\u0026hellip;I argue that a consideration of the historical dynamics that shaped the meaning of secularism allows us to approach this problem anew. Secularism is not a stable, predetermined, universal category, but one whose meaning is particular to its historical context\u0026rdquo; (Tejani 2008: 4-5).\nTejani continues to argue that historical research shows that different societies in Europe and North America negotiated the question of religion in various ways and that \u0026ldquo;people in South Asia, the Middle East, and Africa appropriated the categories of modernity—public and private, religion and politics, secularism and democracy—in ways that rendered these meanings particular.\u0026rdquo; Therefore, she concludes, \u0026ldquo;a universal meaning for secularism cannot be assumed\u0026rdquo; (Tejani 2008: 5-6). Also \u0026ldquo;the moves to reject secularism or infuse the category with new meaning are inadequate, for even in their critique of the normative category they still reinscribe an idea that there can (and should) be a stable, containable meaning for the term, however defined\u0026rdquo; (Tejani 2008: 10-11).\nThis type of argument abounds with confusion. Secularism is supposed to be a category that has been given a universal meaning, while its \u0026lsquo;meaning\u0026rsquo; always depends on historical contexts and has been shaped by historical dynamics. Now, categories do not have meanings; words do. A category or concept is a word with a particular meaning attached to it. Take the word \u0026lsquo;pipe\u0026rsquo; in the English language and its several meanings. According to the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary, three of these meanings are \u0026lsquo;a tubular wind instrument\u0026rsquo;; \u0026lsquo;a long tube or hollow body for conducting a liquid, gas or finely divided solid\u0026rsquo;; and \u0026lsquo;a device for smoking usually consisting of a tube having a bowl at one end and a mouthpiece at the other\u0026rsquo;. These are not different meanings of the category pipe; rather, each of the meanings constitutes a separate category of objects with particular properties. In the same way, one cannot sensibly discuss the universal or multiple meanings of the category secularism, but only the different meanings of the word \u0026lsquo;secularism\u0026rsquo;. Like the different meanings of \u0026lsquo;pipe\u0026rsquo;, these also constitute different categories.\nOne of these categories or concepts of secularism comprises a specific way of organizing the relations between the state and religion or political organizations and religious institutions. When we say that France, the UK, Belgium and India are all secular states, then we are saying that these states come under this category of secularism. This means that we attribute certain basic and common properties to these states or, at least, that these states (try to) embody certain normative principles: they have a minimal separation of the state from religious institutions; they give equal rights to citizens irrespective of religious or ethnic affiliation; they respect the right to freedom of religion; etc. Here, we also see again why such a concept of secularism should always be embedded in a larger theory or conceptual framework. To explain these common properties or principles, we need a theory of secularism or the secular state that explains what it means to give equal rights or to separate politics from religion.\nHistorical research could never show, as Tejani claims, that secularism cannot have \u0026lsquo;a universal meaning\u0026rsquo; because different countries and societies in Europe and America have negotiated the relationship between the state and religion in various ways. Maximally, such historical research could do two things: show that different forms of secularism have developed in these different countries or demonstrate that some of these are not really secular states. To show that France, the UK, the USA and Belgium have developed different forms of the secular state, one should first be able to recognize some political organization as a secular state or manifestation of secularism. That is, one has to presuppose certain common properties that these states possess and which make them instances of the category of secularism, before one could ever argue that they have solved the problems of religion and secularism in different ways. Without such a background concept, against which one compares these different forms of secularism, one could only make the trivial point that France, the UK, the USA and Belgium are very different as political organizations.\nSo let us accept this valid point: because of specific historical dynamics and cultural and societal circumstances, the secular state has taken different forms in these countries. This also allows us to reformulate another issue: since secularism and the secular state have taken different forms in these countries, the words they use to denote this concept of secularism (e.g., \u0026rsquo;laïcité\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;de lekenstaat\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;secular democracy\u0026rsquo;, \u0026rsquo;liberal toleration\u0026rsquo;) will most probably have different connotations in the language use of the respective societies. This does not entail that they have different categories of secularism or that \u0026ldquo;a universal meaning for secularism cannot be assumed.\u0026rdquo; Rather, the fact that we are able to describe these nation-states as instances of (the concept of) secularism – because they possess certain common properties and structures – also allows us to differentiate them as different forms of secularism, because they also have distinct properties related to their specific histories and socio-cultural background. Once we have characterized these distinct properties (always in contrast to their common properties), one could also try and explain the different connotations of the terms \u0026lsquo;secularism\u0026rsquo; or \u0026rsquo;laïcité\u0026rsquo; or \u0026rsquo;lekenstaat\u0026rsquo; in the language use of these societies by showing the links to their historical dynamics (given the fact that we do not possess any theory about the connection between historical developments and language use, this would be very difficult, however).\nLet us turn back to India now. If we say that \u0026lsquo;India is a secular state\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;secularism is central to the modern Indian nation-state\u0026rsquo;, these statements are intelligible only because we have a concept of secularism in mind that attributes certain shared properties or principles to states that are secular. There are two possibilities here. On the one hand, this could be the same concept of secularism that allows us to recognize western nation-states as secular. Then the Indian secular state must have the same set of properties or at least (try and) embody the same set of principles. Naturally, one could argue that the specific historical and cultural dynamics of modern India have also given certain distinct properties to secularism here (as they have in modern France, UK, USA, Belgium), but this cannot deny the common set of properties and principles. In fact, the only way for us to talk intelligibly about the distinct form that secularism has taken in India would be by referring to the common structure that all secular states possess and then showing how India has certain specific properties that are dissimilar to those of certain other secular states.\nOn the other hand, however, one could argue that \u0026lsquo;India is secular\u0026rsquo; but according to another meaning of \u0026lsquo;secularism\u0026rsquo; or a distinct concept or category of secularism. Then we confront a different situation altogether. To return to the analogy of \u0026lsquo;pipe\u0026rsquo;, this is like saying that some object is a pipe, but not in the sense that it is a device for smoking of a particular shape, but rather in the sense of a tubular wind-instrument. In this case, the Indian state would be an instance of a completely different concept or category of secularism. One would then have to use the words \u0026lsquo;secular\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;secularism\u0026rsquo; in a systematic way that refers to the common properties or structure shared by all instances of this distinct concept. One would be compelled to distinguish between secularism1 and secularism2 at all times.\nHere also, one could never conclude that secularism \u0026ldquo;is not a stable, predetermined, universal category, but one whose meaning is particular to its historical context.\u0026rdquo; Of course, the structure of the Indian state would still depend on the historical context in which it has emerged, as does the structure of various western secular states. But one could no longer say that India, like these western states, has developed a different form of secularism, because of its specific historical and cultural dynamics. This type of argument would lead us into the fallacy of equivocation, because \u0026lsquo;secularism\u0026rsquo; would always be used in two different senses and we would continually confuse between secularism1 and secularism2. The Indian secular state would not instantiate a different form of secularism, like France, the UK and the USA have different forms of secularism, because of their historical specificities. Rather, the word \u0026lsquo;secularism\u0026rsquo; in the case of India would mean something completely different; it could even mean \u0026rsquo;theocracy\u0026rsquo;. Do you think this clarifies some of the confusion in the Indian debate on secularism?\n","tags":[],"title":"Fallacy of Equivocation: Indian Secularism","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/fallacy-of-equivocation-indian-secularism/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","basics","translation"],"content":"X says: \u0026ldquo;Wendy Doniger translates all the Sanskrit words into English and thereby ends up distorting their meaning. Dharma becomes religion, Varna becomes color, and apparently she ends up even translating the names of some tribes into English.\u0026rdquo; Assuming that this is the case (assumption is on my part because I have neither read her translation nor do I intend reading it), what is the problem? Out of the conversation, the following considerations came to the fore: (a) if she had retained some of these Sanskrit words, the Indian scholars could have made more sense of the translation; (b) Dharma and religion are not co-extensive in meaning, any more than Varna is with color; (c) consequently, there is a great distortion in translation. Underlying this discussion was a (fragmentarily explicit) view about translation that if we do not find \u0026lsquo;accurate\u0026rsquo; translations of words form one language into another, we should retain the original words, assign them the status of `technical\u0026rsquo; terms, and not translate them any further.\nLet me begin with the view about translation. I have heard it so often from Indians, I could say that this is their `standard\u0026rsquo; view using which they criticize the likes of Wendy more often than not. I have problems with this view: I think it naïve, indefensible and false.\nWe need to put this issue in its generality first. Are there ever \u0026lsquo;accurate\u0026rsquo; translations of texts from one language to another? That is to say, could we ever say that a translation has rendered words from one language to another `accurately\u0026rsquo;? The answer to this question revolves around two things: (a) whether we have some way of accurately knowing the meaning of a word (any word) in a foreign language; (b) whether we have some way of quantifying the accuracy of the meaning of words.\nRegarding (a): In philosophy of language, there is a thesis called \u0026lsquo;indeterminacy\u0026rsquo; of meaning, a thesis original to the American philosopher called Quine. He showed (in his book \u0026ldquo;Word and Object\u0026rdquo;) that, when it comes to translation across languages, words in one language cannot be shown to map onto the meaning of another word in another language. That is, we cannot ever vouch for a \u0026lsquo;correspondence\u0026rsquo; in meaning between two words in two different languages. He was talking about the possibility of translating the word \u0026lsquo;Gavagai\u0026rsquo; (the word used by a foreign tribe whenever they saw a white rabbit) into \u0026lsquo;white rabbit\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;whiteness\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;rabbit\u0026rsquo; and so on. He showed that no matter what kind of empirical tests we use to circumscribe the meaning of \u0026lsquo;Gavagai\u0026rsquo;, there would always be indeterminacy with respect to its translation into English. As far as I know, no one has refuted this thesis and almost all knowledgeable people accept this thesis in one version or another. Needless to say, I subscribe to it as well, even if I am not sure I want to accept Quine\u0026rsquo;s theory of meaning.\nIts lesson is rapidly learnt. If the translation of the word \u0026lsquo;Gavagai\u0026rsquo; (which is produced only when a white rabbit is seen) is itself subject to indeterminacy, what about words like \u0026lsquo;Dharma\u0026rsquo; and so on? Obviously, it is only greater: the very fact we are all easily \u0026lsquo;dissatisfied\u0026rsquo; with this translation indicates that the latitude is very great. Each one of us can now sit down and compile our hobby-horse list of the untranslatable Sanskrit words: Deva, puja, laukika, atman, brahma, varna, dharma … Compiling such a list is uninteresting and trivial because it is utterly uninformative.\nRegarding (b). If this is the case with respect to (a), there is not much of an answer to give about \u0026lsquo;quantifying\u0026rsquo; the accuracy of translation. At best, one could have a problem with the \u0026lsquo;quality\u0026rsquo;. But one can express this dissatisfaction ONLY if one has a better alternative: \u0026ldquo;\u0026lsquo;Religion\u0026rsquo; should not translate `Dharma\u0026rsquo;. A better translation would be \u0026lsquo;…\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; (For the simple reason that one is dissatisfied with the \u0026lsquo;quality\u0026rsquo; of translation and this requires comparison.)\nOur problem, as Indians, is only beginning. Consider the statement: \u0026ldquo;The word \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo; does not accurately translate \u0026lsquo;dharma\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; (or any of its ilks). This statement presupposes that the speaker knows the meaning of the word \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo; in English and the meaning of the Sanskrit word \u0026lsquo;Dharma\u0026rsquo;. Otherwise, he cannot criticize the translation of these two words. One could assume that if English were to be our native language, we have the intuitions of a native speaker with respect to the use of the word \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo; (or its meaning). For most of us, this is not the case: English is not our mother-tongue. Neither is Sanskrit. We have learnt both languages through the medium of other languages (like Hindi, Marathi, Bengali…) and so on. That is to say, our understanding of the meaning of the words \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;dharma\u0026rsquo; is itself susceptible to the indeterminacy thesis. One cannot anymore argue that the intuitions of a native Bengali speaker with respect to how he uses the word \u0026lsquo;Dharma\u0026rsquo; in Bengali tracks the meaning of the Sanskrit word \u0026lsquo;Dharma\u0026rsquo;. Exactly the same argument applies to his knowledge of the word \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo; in English. This being the case, how can an Indian confidently assert that he knows what \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo; means in English or \u0026lsquo;dharma\u0026rsquo; means in Sanskrit in an accurate fashion? He simply cannot. That is why many Indians do think that \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo; translates \u0026lsquo;Dharma\u0026rsquo; accurately; some others disagree. Do we really know what the various meanings of \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo; in English are? I have yet to come across an Indian who knows what he is talking about when he talks about religion; but I have come across indefinitely many who believe that they \u0026lsquo;know\u0026rsquo; what religion is and put across pompous and half-baked \u0026rsquo;theses\u0026rsquo; about religion.\nAdded to this, is the nature of a word like \u0026lsquo;Dharma\u0026rsquo; in some Indian language or another (or even with a Sanskrit pundit whose mother tongue is Sanskrit). Everyone routinely assures us that this is a complex word with multiple meanings. (People forget or do not know that this is also the case for a word like \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo;.) If this is true, you can never assign a technical meaning to this word and leave it untranslated. Because, technical terms (as anybody with any modicum of scientific training knows) are univocal: their meaning is rigidly defined in the context of a theory. If \u0026lsquo;Dharma\u0026rsquo; has to be used as a \u0026rsquo;technical\u0026rsquo; term, one has to unambiguously define its meaning and that meaning must not be equivocal but univocal instead. But that is precisely the problem, is it not? These considerations apply to all the pet lists we can make about the `untranslatable\u0026rsquo; Sanskrit words.\nIf one does not translate such words into English but leaves them intact, what exactly do you translate then? Each sentence would be replete with \u0026lsquo;untranslatables\u0026rsquo;, and we might as well say that one should not translate texts from one language into another. Think of it the next time you want to read Homer or Tolstoy or any of the classics of the western world.\nNot only should we bear the above points in mind when we criticize the western intellectuals for translating Indian texts, but it should also be clear what lessons it holds with respect to this thread: what are these Indic \u0026lsquo;categories\u0026rsquo; that we should use to describe the world and how could the user of these \u0026lsquo;categories\u0026rsquo; know that he knows the \u0026lsquo;correct\u0026rsquo; meaning of Sanskrit words? If he does not, what exactly is being talked about? Who will understand him, when most of us either do not know Sanskrit or only have learnt it through the medium of other languages, including, sometimes, English?\nComments ~rAGU — 2014-04-23 10:50:00\nI think you are complicating a rather simple issue. If I translate your article to Kannada and use words to mean what you did not intend, would you say going by indeterminacy\u0026rsquo; I can\u0026rsquo;t be blamed for mistranslation? Also there is no single precise meaning for many words in a language. In that sense many words themselves are \u0026lsquo;indeterminate\u0026rsquo; let alone their translation. But that does mean we can not argue either that a word was inappropriately used or mistranslated.\nDocWhiteCloud — 2014-04-23 16:01:00\nRagu, most of the posts are just ideas/insights, which need to be fully developed into theories.

What is interesting or important about this goal or venture? This, as I said, is the issue but we need to do some amount of thinking before we can identify the real question. That is so because there is a lot of deadwood floating around that makes navigation difficult. So, let me begin the process of clearing some of the debris.\nThe first problem that faces us is the identification of the word \u0026ldquo;Indic Categories\u0026rdquo;. What does this refer to? From the many discussions I have been involved with, here is what I glean. Consider the following Sanskrit words: Dharma, Rasa, Rta, Deva, Puja, … etc. There are very great difficulties involved in translating these words into, say, English without distorting their meaning. Without fear of controversy, one can grant that this claim is true. But what follows from noticing this difficulty?\nThe simplest argument is the following: \u0026ldquo;Therefore, we must use Indic categories to describe the world\u0026rdquo;. However, this therefore' does not follow logically without making additional assumptions. For instance, the problem of translating across any two languages faces an analogous difficulty; it is neither limited to nor exhausted by the difficulties involved in translating from Sanskrit to English. Translating from the French to English confronts similar problems as translating from Sanskrit to Kannada. Does that mean that we should never undertake translations from one language to another and that each people speaking in one language continue to speak in \u0026quot;their own categories\u0026quot;? Could one ever learn another language, in that case? Does it make sense to speak of \u0026quot;French\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;German\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;Italian\u0026quot; categories? It must make sense, because the issue involves Sanskrit and English *words* and their meaning. If such usage does not make sense, whatever does it mean to speak of \u0026quot;Indic\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;western\u0026quot; categories? (One could use these as shorthand for something else, but such use also exhausts their meaning.) We use the word categories\u0026rsquo; to speak about the meaning of words in some or another language. Neither \u0026ldquo;Indic\u0026rdquo; nor \u0026ldquo;western\u0026rdquo; are languages. Consequently, only two conclusions are possible: (a) either \u0026ldquo;Indic\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;western\u0026rdquo; categories are shorthand for \u0026ldquo;something else\u0026rdquo;; or (b) it is flatly nonsensical to speak of Indic and western categories.\nLet me focus on the second alternative for the moment. Very often, I have heard people say that without knowing Sanskrit, one cannot formulate truths and insights about the Indian culture. This claim is often used as a stick to beat one\u0026rsquo;s opponents, whether they are westerners or Indians. While one might win a shouting match by using this stick, it is very unclear what else it does or is capable of doing. Surely, this claim is empirically false: one can study Ancient Greece, the Roman culture without knowing Ancient Greek or Early Latin; one can study the medieval Christians without knowing Church Latin; and so on. If this is possible, why cannot one study Indian culture without knowing Sanskrit? It is even false to say that one cannot formulate a hypothesis about a language without knowing that particular language: linguistic science is a living and a flourishing refutation of that claim.\nOften, without their knowledge, people who put across such thesis are defending the idea that studying a language is identical to studying the culture of a people. This is a very old and discarded idea that many Indologists defend.\nLet us look at the possibility that one uses Indic and Western categories as shorthand for \u0026ldquo;something else\u0026rdquo;. What could that `something else\u0026quot; be? A charitable answer could run as follows: one should use Indian theories to describe the world. Which Indian theories should we use to describe the world and why? Further, which world are we talking about? The natural world, the social world, the world of the twenty-first century…? Unless one answers these and many other questions satisfactorily, it is difficult to take this alternative seriously.

However, unless one gives a technical meaning to \u0026lsquo;category\u0026rsquo; (which one can), these usages do not violate the primary distinction between a word from some natural language and its meaning.\nConsider a classificatory scheme, say, cubes. Here, \u0026lsquo;cube\u0026rsquo; is a word, it has some meaning, and we classify (let us say) some objects together. That is, we say that some objects can be categorized as cubes. However, by saying this we do not mean that some objects (say some coloured, and some wooden objects) are instances of the English word \u0026lsquo;cube\u0026rsquo;. (Assume that we are teaching English to someone who does not know that language. When we classify some objects and teach him the word, we are not teaching him how the word is written, what the constituent alphabets of that word are but its meaning. Now he understands the meaning of the word \u0026lsquo;cube\u0026rsquo;.) What we mean is that each of these objects is an instance of the category \u0026lsquo;cube\u0026rsquo; (i.e. the meaning of the word \u0026lsquo;cube\u0026rsquo;). Even here, we do not mean that the meaning of the word \u0026lsquo;cube\u0026rsquo;= some physical object. (That is, we do not suggest that \u0026lsquo;meaning\u0026rsquo; looks like a physical object. The physical object is not an embodiment of the meaning of a word.) What we mean is that the meaning of the word \u0026lsquo;cube\u0026rsquo; allows us to bring descriptions of some other objects together.\nOur classifications of the world does use language, thus words from a language, and hence categories. Once we appreciate this, there is no problem (this becomes a short-hand) in saying that pratyksha, for instance, is a category. When asked, we always have the possibility of saying that we are talking about the category of pratyaksha and not about the word \u0026lsquo;pratyaksha\u0026rsquo;.\nWhen we observe the way natural language functions, we discern another crucial role of words. They also refer to the world. For instance, London refers to the capital city of UK, whereas \u0026lsquo;London\u0026rsquo; is a six-letter word. In this sense, the word \u0026lsquo;cube\u0026rsquo; is both a word from English and it also refers to objects in the world. In philosophy of language, there is a huge debate about the relation between the meaning of a word and its reference. But these issues are not relevant for our current discussions.\nCould we speak of culturally preferred ways of categorization? As long as we keep some distinctions in mind, between a word, its meaning and reference, yes. What does it mean to say this? It means that different cultures provide descriptions of \u0026rsquo;the world\u0026rsquo; in different ways. That is, the meanings they ascribe to their natural language words are different. Not merely that. It might also be the case that some of their meanings might be entirely untranslatable into meanings that words have in some other natural language.\nWhat does that indicate? In the absence of a theory (that can be tested, improved upon, etc), classifications do not mirror the structure of the world. They could, but the only way to know this is with the help of a theory (even here, qualifications are needed but I will forego them). Consequently, a discussion about whether some categorization (or classification) is cognitively better than the other is an entirely fruitless discussion, if the goal of the discussion is to contribute to the knowledge of the world.\nAs I have said already, if one uses \u0026lsquo;Indic categories\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;western categories\u0026rsquo; as a short-hand to indicate how Indians and westerners understand the meaning of some words etc, there is no problem. But if one wants to go further than that, the onus shifts to the one who wants to further.\n","tags":[],"title":"Fuss about Indic categories II","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/fuss-about-indic-categories-ii/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","basics","concept(category)"],"content":"Let me give the gist of the consensus and overlook philosophical nuances about categories.\nConsider the following sentences: \u0026lsquo;It is raining\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;het regent\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;Es Regnet\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;Baarish aa raha hai\u0026rsquo;. All these sentences have the same meaning, namely that it is raining. Or it could also be said that they all express the same \u0026ldquo;proposition\u0026rdquo;. So, \u0026ldquo;meaning\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;proposition\u0026rdquo; are used as quasi-synonyms; and sentences from natural languages have meaning or express propositions. Another synonym to \u0026ldquo;meaning\u0026rdquo; would be the \u0026ldquo;sense\u0026rdquo; of a sentence.\nAnd then we have words from different languages. \u0026lsquo;Rain\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;regen\u0026rsquo;, \u0026ldquo;baarish\u0026rdquo;. They have meaning. This meaning can also be called \u0026ldquo;sense\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;concept\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;category\u0026rdquo; or even \u0026ldquo;idea\u0026rdquo;. These are virtual synonyms: words have sense or meaning, or they express concepts, or they instantiate categories or they are ideas.\nThe difference that we notice in how we use these words (\u0026ldquo;words instance a category or express meaning or proposition\u0026rdquo;) are more indications of philosophical commitments: do propositions exist? Is meaning a property of sentences? And such like. Some of these issues are about ontology.\nOntology refers to what we take to exist in the world. Does the world include physical objects, propositions, mathematical numbers, Infinity, mathematical sets? etc. Or does it consist only of physical objects? Do properties like \u0026lsquo;blue\u0026rsquo; exist or do only blue-colored objects exist? And so on. A \u0026ldquo;category mistake\u0026rdquo; is a mistake in one\u0026rsquo;s ontology: one wrongly attributes properties that belong to objects in one domain to objects in another domain. My favorite example is borrowed from Chomsky: \u0026ldquo;Do Green ideas sleep furiously?\u0026rdquo; is an example of a category mistake. In our ontology (that is, what we take to exist in the world), ideas have no color, they do not sleep, and sleeping cannot be qualified with the adjective \u0026lsquo;furious\u0026rsquo;. However, the question is syntactically well-formed but it is semantic nonsense because it commits a category mistake.\nNot every category mistake is nonsense. Many jokes are humorous precisely because they commit a category mistake.\nTo speak of \u0026lsquo;western\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;Indic\u0026rsquo; categories is to claim that there is something western or Indic to the meaning of words. That is, by looking at the meaning of a word, it should be possible for us to say that it is \u0026lsquo;Indic\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;western\u0026rsquo;. (Consider the meaning of the word \u0026lsquo;Baarish\u0026rsquo;. Is it \u0026lsquo;Indic\u0026rsquo; or Western\u0026rsquo;? Exactly the same point holds for the meaning of words like \u0026lsquo;Deva\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;Dharma\u0026rsquo;.) It is one thing to say that the meaning of a Sanskrit word cannot be translated to mean some or another English word (or the other way round). This is a typical problem of translatability (of meaning) across any two languages. However, it is quite simply impossible to say that some or another \u0026lsquo;idea\u0026rsquo;, or \u0026lsquo;concept\u0026rsquo;, or \u0026lsquo;category\u0026rsquo; is Indic or Western. Of course, one could say some such thing: but it is impossible to say what makes some idea carry a culture on its shirt sleeves, so to speak. What properties of an idea transform it into a culture-specific idea? Note that \u0026lsquo;idea\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;category\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;concept\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;meaning\u0026rsquo;, etc. are seen to be only semantic in nature. That is, they have only semantic properties (\u0026lsquo;semantic\u0026rsquo; means \u0026lsquo;meaning-related\u0026rsquo;).\nAnumana, pratyksha, etc. are not Indic categories; they are Sanskrit words. Either \u0026lsquo;anumana\u0026rsquo; (for example) belongs to the category instanced by the English word \u0026lsquo;inference\u0026rsquo; or the Dutch word \u0026lsquo;afleiden\u0026rsquo; or it is an instance of a different category. However, one cannot make a philosophical point on this basis.One could use \u0026lsquo;Indic categories\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;western categories\u0026rsquo; as short-hand for something like this: most Indians or westerners (as the case may be) understand the meaning of some words because it is a part of their natural language-use. Most Indians, for instance, \u0026lsquo;intuitively\u0026rsquo; understand the word \u0026lsquo;Dharma\u0026rsquo; (even if most of them cannot explicate its nuances). So, one might want to say, it is an \u0026lsquo;Indic\u0026rsquo; category.\n","tags":[],"title":"Fuss about Indic categories(concepts) I","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/fuss-about-indic-categoriesconcepts/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","basics","Hinduism"],"content":" Many facts are interconnected within a culture.

Some hypothesis or another notices some of these facts as facts, and it is able to provide an explanation (using the term \u0026rsquo;explanation\u0026rsquo; rather loosely) for them. This explanation helps us understand the phenomenon (means merely the appearance) in question because the theory or hypothesis under discussion is able to show what that interconnection between the sets of facts is. (That is, it tells us of the pattern that unifies these facts into a whole of some sort.)\nWhich facts are relevant? This question cannot be answered in the absence of a theory (or hypothesis). So, for instance, when X comes up with a set of facts (practices) he is saying that the facts he notices are relevant to the issue of deciding what \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; is. His non-exhaustive list looks like this: \u0026ldquo;the various ceremonies that mark the transitions in life; the patterns (not the particulars) of festivals, fasts, temples \u0026amp; shrines, household puja, pilgrimage, the epics, Puranas, trinity, concept of avataar, etc.,etc.\u0026rdquo; In other words, these facts (not others like the structure of latrines, the use of spices in cooking, wearing saris, etc) are considered relevant to deciding the question. That he selects only some common facts and not others as relevant facts to discuss the nature of Hinduism suggests that he is working with an (implicit or explicit) hypothesis about what Hinduism is. This is an obvious conclusion: as facts, each fact is as important and as relevant as any other fact. Only a hypothesis can assign weights and relevance to the facts. If he were to have no hypothesis about what Hinduism is, he would simply wave his hands in the direction of India and say that \u0026ldquo;all the facts\u0026rdquo; of the culture have a pattern behind them (which has not hitherto been investigated) and that pattern is Hinduism.\nIf you were to presuppose some commonsense idea about the concept of religion, his selection makes sense. However, if you use, say, the concepts of \u0026rsquo;laukika\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;paramaaarthika\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;adhyaatmika\u0026rsquo; then the choice of these facts are not self-evident. One has to justify why a festival is not \u0026rsquo;laukika\u0026rsquo; but \u0026lsquo;paramarthika\u0026rsquo;; whether pilgrimage is really in the best interests of \u0026lsquo;adhyaatmika\u0026rsquo; and so on. Using the word \u0026lsquo;Dharma\u0026rsquo; makes the choice of facts in this list even more non-obvious: \u0026lsquo;Is going to pilgrimage a dharma?\u0026rsquo; Is believing in puranas a Dharma?\u0026rsquo; and so on. However, if we reformulate, say, the previous question, it makes sense: \u0026lsquo;do puranas talk about Dharma?\u0026rsquo; It shows that using the notion of Dharma in this context is a matter of some complexity and not self-evident. However this problem is not manifest if we use the word \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo;: Is believing in Puranas religious? Is pilgrimage a religious act? And so on. In other words, the obviousness of the facts is absent when we use concepts from the Indian traditions. However, this obviousness is present if we work with some or another commonsense concept of religion and the idea that Hinduism is a religion.\nThat X also thinks this way is evidenced in his reaction to my \u0026lsquo;hipkapi\u0026rsquo; examples. Even though most of the facts I cite are biological, he said that the facts were unrelated to each other. Why did he say this? My argument was that \u0026lsquo;hipkapi\u0026rsquo; is the common pattern unifying these facts. However, \u0026lsquo;hipkapi\u0026rsquo; did not explain anything; it was merely a name. On the other hand, to use X\u0026rsquo;s argument, there could be a pattern behind the hipkapi facts; none has investigated them hitherto. Why did he dismiss it so easily? The answer is obvious: names do not explain anything.\nI confront the same situation with respect to Hinduism. It is just a name at the moment (in X\u0026rsquo;s argument). He puts together some facts (hipkapi facts), says that the pattern unifying them is \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; (or hipkapi), and that no one has investigated whether there is a pattern behind them (hipkapi pattern).\nHowever, the difference between Hipkapi and Hinduism, in our present context, is this. The very facts that X uses are used to suggest the existence of a religion called \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo;. X appears to consent to one aspect of the argument: there is Hniduism, and these facts are facts of Hinduism. The only issue is what is Hinduism if it is not a religion? This question already presupposes the truth of what requires to be proved: that the facts that X talks about are (some of the relevant) facts that settle the issue. Such an assumption points in the direction of a hypothesis.\nIn other words, X has to show that the structure of the latrines in India (for instance) is less relevant to settling the issue of the existence of Hinduism than, say, pilgrimages. Why cannot I say that the proof that British constructed \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; is provided by the fact of Indians driving on the left-side of the road?\nThis entire post makes the following simple point. In choosing some facts as relevant facts, one uses a hypothesis. Facts, to put it even more simply, are facts of a theory. The existence question of Hinduism can be solved only in the presence of a hypothesis (explicit or implicit) about what that entity is. If we are not careful, we merely take over the commonsense conception of religion to identify Hinduism, even if we explicitly say that it is not a religion.\nPerhaps, X can come up with a positive argument why he thinks that there is an entity called Hinduism. It is not sufficient to say that there could be pattern behind some arbitrary list of facts and that one would like to call that pattern Hinduism. If one does that, all one says is that Hinduism is hipkapi.\nCheck Does Hinduism Exist?\n","tags":["hipkapi"],"title":"Which facts are relevant?

So, when I say that religion is such an entity, namely, it claims that it is the word of God and that it claims to be unconditionally true and that it is about the Cosmos, I am accepting the self description of religion. (However, the hypothesis that religion is an explanatorily intelligible (EI) account formulates it without committing itself to any ontological claims. That is, it takes no stances about what specific religions say or do not say about the existence of entities. The hypothesis does not show how, and in what sense, the Bible, say, is an EI account. It merely says that The Bible has such a status to believers. If you reread the relevant paragraphs of \u0026lsquo;The Heathen in his blindness: Asia, the West and the dynamic of religion\u0026rsquo; where I first formulate the hypothesis, you will notice that I formulate it conditionally: \u0026ldquo;If such a being exists, if such an account is forthcoming \u0026hellip; etc then we have an EI account.\u0026rdquo;) If we do not accept the self-description of religion, The Bible becomes a mere book and we cannot study it at all to say anything about Christianity.\nHowever, this meta-characterization is not interesting in and of itself. You see religion as the EI account of the Cosmos and itself could come into being without having most of the properties that the empirical religions in human societies possess. (See the Scientific Fiction example in Chapter 9.) So, when I do talk about religions, I speak of what happens when people believe that they have a religion and the empirical constraints such people put on religion. The dynamic of universalization of religion comes into existence because of the logic of how people go-about in the world: they have a religion and that it is an exemplification of religion. The cultural history of the West can be written because of the internal tension within Christianity: it is both religion and merely one religion in human community.\nReligions, if studied either as Religion or as World view, force us to do theology. But religion also generates a configuration of learning and I study religion at this level of abstraction. Here, I do not have to accept the self-description of religion but merely describe the dynamic of the emergence of a configuration of learning. The latter is brought into existence by human beings who relate to each other and the world in a particular way. So, I accept the existence of a configuration of learning; I believe that it is possible to develop hypotheses about it that satisfy the best criteria of rationality and scientificity that we possess. I do not have to assume the existence of religion: I say that people act as though what they have is religion; one can say that they are rational beings because the existence of religion is a good reason for them to believe in the existence of religion; they believe in its existence; this attitude makes them go-about in the world in a particular way (i.e. this is their configuration of learning); and this way of going-about in the world has a structure and logic that can be described; such descriptions can be tested in a rational way\u0026hellip; In other words, religion can be studied at three different levels of abstraction: (a) religion as religion - this is the level of self-description of religion; (b) religion as also a world view - this also forces us to do some kind of theology; (c) apart from being religion and world view, a religion also produces a configuration of learning. My studies are pitched at the level of (c) and does not touch either (a) or (b).\n","tags":[],"title":"Is Bible an explanatorily intelligle account of Cosmos and of itself?","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/is-bible-an-explanatorily-intelligle-account-of-cosmos-and-of-itself/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","petitio principii","religion"],"content":" Are there accounts about the origin of religion? Yes, there are at least two kinds. One kind tries to localise the origin of religion in human beings and the other in God. 1.1. If religion is what it also says about itself, namely, it is the word of God, what are we trying to answer when we try to answer the issue of the origin of religion? Are we trying to give a scientific answer to the question, why God gave religion to humanity or are we trying to answer the question why humankind believes in the existence of God? If the former, then this question has been answered differently by different religions, i.e., this is the theology of these different religions.\n1.2. We could assume that God does not exist and try to answer the question why humankind believes in His existence. If we do this, we will not be studying religion at all (because religion is what it says about itself) but something else. Most so-called \u0026lsquo;scientific\u0026rsquo; theories about the origin of religion go in this direction.\n1.3. What do I say? I do make the strongest claim: there can be no scientific account about the origin of religion, ever, that is not theology. That is to say, my hypothesis entails two claims: all existing theories that claim to explain the origin of religion assume the truth of what they want to explain; and no future theory will ever solve this problem, unless it is theology. Thus, one way of refuting \u0026lsquo;The Heathen\u0026hellip;\u0026rsquo; is to show that there exists a \u0026lsquo;scientific\u0026rsquo; theory about religion that does not commit the fallacy of petitio principii. And that it does tell us how religion came into being in a scientific way.\n1.4. Does this make the origin of religion into a mystery? Of course not. We do have accounts that explain religion as the act of God. It might or might not be a mystery why God does this or anything else, but the origin is not a mystery.\n1.5. However, this does not mean that we cannot study the history of some or another specific religion (say, Judaism) scientifically. By doing so, however, we will not be saying anything about the origin of religion.\nLet me totally trivialize \u0026lsquo;The Heathen in his blindness: Asia, the West and the dynamic of religion\u0026rsquo; to give you an idea of the nature of the difficulty involved in explaining what religion is and hence the impossibility of explaining its origin. 2.1. Is religion present in human communities? This is not a simple question to answer because it is actually asking the following question: \u0026ldquo;Is there an account, which fuses the causal with the intentional explanation in such a way that it is the unconditional truth about everything that was, everything that is, and everything that shall be in the Cosmos?\u0026rdquo; How are you going to answer this question? If you say \u0026lsquo;yes\u0026rsquo;, then you are endorsing the claim that religion makes about itself: so, you are doing theology. If you say \u0026rsquo;no\u0026rsquo;, you are denying the manifest truth that there are people who do believe that they have a religion.\n2.2. One trivial way of solving the question is to say \u0026rsquo;there are people who believe they have a religion\u0026rsquo; and one good reason why people believe in this is because they also believe that religion exists (i.e., such people are neither stupid nor hallucinating or whatever).\n2.3. Why do people believe that they have a religion? Because they believe that religion exists. The existence of an object is a good reason to believe in the existence of the said object; such people believe in the existence of such an object; therefore, they believe that they have a religion. In short, believers are rational because they believe that religion exists. The so-called scientific theories want something more: they ask whether such an object \u0026lsquo;really\u0026rsquo; exists. Unfortunately, they cannot ever answer this question because the question cannot be properly formulated at all.\n2.4. Why? Note that the question is not about the existence of Christianity, Judaism or Islam. It is about whether they are religions or not. Again, you cannot settle the issue by looking at how many call any of the three using the word \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo;. It is about whether these three are religions or not. How can you find out whether they are religions or not? They are religions if they are the gift of God, otherwise they are not. How can you settle the issue whether or not religion is God\u0026rsquo;s gift to Humanity without talking about God (i.e. without doing theology)? In other words, there cannot ever be a scientific answer to the ill-formulated question about the origin of religion. \u0026lsquo;The Heathen\u0026hellip;\u0026rsquo; shows why the question is ill-formulated (even though the prima facie appearance of the question about the origin of religion is that it is well-formulated) and thus explains why it has not been solved \u0026lsquo;scientifically\u0026rsquo; so far. Thus, the book predicts that the issue will never be settled \u0026lsquo;scientifically\u0026rsquo;, unless we allow theology as the science of religion.\n","tags":[],"title":"Why the question about the origin of religion is ill-formulated?","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/the-origin-of-religion/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","rationality","tradition"],"content":"If we understand the word \u0026rsquo;tradition\u0026rsquo; to mean \u0026lsquo;a set of practices\u0026rsquo;, then the question is this: why continue a set of practices? When someone \u0026lsquo;justifies\u0026rsquo; (I will soon explain why I use scare quotes for this) this by referring to the existence of a set of practices, what exactly is the person doing?\nOne way of looking at it is to say that the person \u0026lsquo;justifies\u0026rsquo; his actions and understand justification to mean providing a logically derived conclusion from a set of premises. The validity of the reasoning would constitute the justification in this context. Quite obviously, because we are speaking of logical justification, we are inclined to formulate the premises, test the derivation and look at the truth value of the conclusion.\nThere is, however, another way of looking at the notion of \u0026lsquo;justification\u0026rsquo;. One justifies an action by pointing to some or another action. In this case, justification refers to some kind of a relation between actions, and not between beliefs. Even though it might not be clear at this moment what kind of a relation should exist between two actions such that one action justifies another, the point is that such a justification is also possible.\nIn the second case, what misleads the discussion is the use of the word \u0026lsquo;justification\u0026rsquo; in one of its senses, the sense in which it is applicable only to beliefs. That is to say, the problem lies not in the fact that some person has to believe that he must continue the tradition; he is suggesting that the existence of a set of actions provides a justification (in the second sense of the word) for his actions.\nShould it be possible to make sense of this construal philosophically, the answer is obvious: indeed one can justify the continuation of a tradition without having the belief that one must continue the tradition.\n","tags":[],"title":"Do practices need rational justifications?","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/do-practices-need-a-rational-justification/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","secularization","world view","explanatorily intelligible"],"content":"Lets become clear about the nature of my claims about worldviews.\nThe word carries multiple meanings. It has partly to do with the multiple meanings of the component words: world\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;view\u0026rsquo;. In daily language-use, \u0026lsquo;world\u0026rsquo; is used to pick out (a) a spatial and temporal slice of the cosmos (b) and/or the entire Cosmos itself. The first, the slices, are many: from the \u0026lsquo;social world\u0026rsquo; to the \u0026rsquo;emotional world\u0026rsquo;; from earth (\u0026lsquo;our world\u0026rsquo;) to parts of the same (\u0026lsquo;our part of the world\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;in different parts of the world\u0026rsquo;) and so on. The same consideration applies to \u0026lsquo;view\u0026rsquo;: it could refer to perspectives (\u0026lsquo;my view of the issue\u0026rsquo;) and to the totality (\u0026lsquo;we now have a clear view of the situation\u0026rsquo;). As though this is not enough, the word \u0026lsquo;world view\u0026rsquo; also carries additional multiple meanings: it picks out a totality of beliefs that some individual has; it refers at times exclusively to false beliefs (the Marxist use of the notion of ideology); it is either necessary or strictly superfluous (depending on how one interprets the scope of \u0026lsquo;ideology\u0026rsquo;); it picks out the common denominator among a group of people and the latter itself can refer to a nation, a class, a culture, the species, etc.\nConsequently, to ask for the meaning of \u0026lsquo;world view\u0026rsquo; is to ask for some individual\u0026rsquo;s definition of the word. It also indicates that there is no theory about the world views, their role and nature and such like. This is one of the claims of the 10th chapter.\nDespite the lack of clarity and the presence of ambiguity, some people use it to explain many things: \u0026rsquo;the crisis in the western world view\u0026rsquo;, the \u0026rsquo;nature\u0026rsquo; of the Tibetan world view, and such like. One also talks about the need for a \u0026lsquo;scientific world view\u0026rsquo; and the need for a world view for an individual. In order to make sense of these kinds of claims, I use the word \u0026lsquo;world view\u0026rsquo; in the following way in \u0026lsquo;The Heathen…\u0026rsquo;: \u0026lsquo;world\u0026rsquo; refers to everything that was, is and shall be; \u0026lsquo;view\u0026rsquo; refers to a totality of perspectives. \u0026lsquo;World view\u0026rsquo;, under these restrictions, is something different from the (partial) theories we produce about (slices of) the world. That is to say, our intuitive psychological and philosophical notions about people belong to the domains of our theories in psychology and philosophy. This rendering of the meaning of the word allows me to make sense of many, many linguistic expressions that use the word \u0026lsquo;world view\u0026rsquo;. It also shows that we are unable to come up with examples of \u0026lsquo;secular\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;scientific\u0026rsquo; world views and it appears as though \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo; is the only example we have of \u0026lsquo;world view\u0026rsquo;.\nIt is important to notice the level of abstraction: religion is the best (or only) example of world view. This or that specific religion (say, Christianity, Judaism, Islam) becomes this or that specific world view: Christian world view, Islamic world view, Jewish world view and so on. As I have explained at length, \u0026lsquo;Religion\u0026rsquo; is always a specific religion in human communities, and this is a constraint on religion. Even though religion is an EI account, it is formulated in some or another human language and thus becomes some or another religion. This limits \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo; because religion cannot be restricted by time, place or ideational clothes. So, I suggest that religion is compelled to move beyond the restriction of being a specific religion (that is, some or another specific content that makes into some religion or another) and become \u0026ldquo;as formal as possible\u0026rdquo;. Here, the word \u0026lsquo;form\u0026rsquo; refers to the \u0026rsquo;logical form\u0026rsquo; of the EI account, stripped of its semantic content. (It is, however, the semantic content that makes it into a specific EI account.) In simple terms, such a \u0026lsquo;world view\u0026rsquo; cannot have any doctrines (each doctrine limits \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo; and makes it into a specific religion), any beliefs (each belief has \u0026lsquo;some\u0026rsquo; meaning), and so on. Such a purely \u0026lsquo;formal entity\u0026rsquo; would be \u0026rsquo;the world view\u0026rsquo;: but, given the nature of human beings, we will not get such a world view. The explanatory intelligibility consists in religion being a very specific set of claims about the world, but for religion to be what it is, namely, the EI account, it has to go beyond (i.e. transcend) every specific belief. Such a formal entity is \u0026rsquo;the world view\u0026rsquo;: it comes into being in the process of religion trying to free itself from the limitation of being a specific religion, and the process of secularization names this process.\nThis hypothesis allows me (among other things) to make sense of the belief that people have about \u0026lsquo;world views\u0026rsquo; even though no one has succeeded in outlining a world view. (Those who believe they have a world view are invited to write down their world view. Once this attempt is made, one realizes that one has merely many \u0026lsquo;beliefs\u0026rsquo; about slices of the world that belong to domains like ethics, metaphysics, political philosophy, psychology, sociology, etc. What makes this arbitrary set into a world view and not just a hotchpotch of partial claims about slices of the world? In the absence of a satisfactory explanation, all one can do is to take recourse to a definitional fiat: \u0026lsquo;I call this my world view\u0026rsquo;. ) No one has given an explanation as to why \u0026rsquo;nationalism\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;Marxism\u0026rsquo; are world views; or how, say, a Christian world view differs from the Christian religion; or why the Encyclopedia Britannica is not merely an encyclopedia but a \u0026lsquo;scientific\u0026rsquo; world view; and so on. The logic of my argument suggests that nobody will be able to do it either.\nI do not argue that a world view exists as a secular counterpart to religion; I say that the process of secularization of religion is its attempt to become a world view. I do not say that one can identify a world view today because I say that the only examples of the use of this word are its references to specific religions. This explains (as far as I am concerned) why people do not want to give up the idea of a \u0026lsquo;world view\u0026rsquo;. To do so is to give up the idea of the universality of religion. It also shows us why the issue of the existence of religion in all human cultures is of cognitive interest: the claim that all individuals, peoples and cultures have a world view is a secular counterpart of the religious belief about religion\u0026rsquo;s universality. Such a belief also suggests that having a world view is indispensable to a successful navigation in the world. My hypothesis thus explains why the intensity with which this belief is held is directly proportional to the lack of any evidence for the existence of a world view outside of specific religions. And so on.\nIn other words, people in religious cultures are \u0026lsquo;intuitively\u0026rsquo; convinced that all people have a world view. They are convinced of this not because they have a world view that is distinct from some religion or another but because they belong to a culture where some religion or another has generated the process of secularization. I further say that people in non-religious cultures would have great difficulty is explaining what the discussions about world views are about. They lack the intuitive conviction that members of a religious culture share. The Indians on this yahoo group would not lose their sleep if (a) they discover that they all have a world view or (b) realize that they never had one. Apart from a purely cognitive interest, they have no other stake in the issue. In fact, the way in which this discussion is going on itself indicates the truth of the above fact. (I do not want to elaborate on this.)\nIn the form of simple claims, these are my assertions in \u0026lsquo;The Heathen in his blindness: Asia, the West and the dynamic of religion\u0026rsquo;. (a) We do not know what a world view is outside of specific religions; (b) There are no examples of secular or scientific world views; (c) The conviction about the universality and indispensability of world views is a secularized religious claim; (d) we can explain this conviction by looking at the secularization process of religion (note the level of abstraction); (e) world view can only name secularized religion (again note that this is not a claim about this or that specific religion). Therefore, the \u0026lsquo;challenge\u0026rsquo; to identify a world view that is a secular counterpart to religion is the challenge to identify religion as such and not this or that religion. As human beings, we constrain religion to become this or that religion; religion as such cannot exist in human communities (see my science fiction example in the ninth chapter). Consequently, there will no \u0026lsquo;world view\u0026rsquo; to identify either.\n","tags":[],"title":"Secularized Christian belief: worldview is a cultural universal","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/secularized-christian-belief-worldview-is-a-cultural-universal/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","secularization","world view"],"content":"To begin with the question raised in `The Heathen in his blindness: Asia, the West and the dynamic of religion\u0026rsquo;: Do all cultures, peoples, and individuals need a world view to navigate themselves in the world? The answer is in the negative because religion is not a cultural universal and the only examples we have of world views are religions.\nAre the atheists, free thinkers, and people ignorant of religious doctrines of Christianity (in the West) also religious? This question has a positive answer because of the process of secularization of religion. In this sense, keeping in mind that the process of secularization is how a religion attempts to transcend its constraints, the atheists etc. in the west do have a Christian world view. This means the following: they accept the doctrines of a de-Christianized Christianity and, for these to be continually transmitted and make sense to those who accept them, this religion requires to be present in the background (and is subject to secularization movement). That is to say, we can identify elements of a Christian world view in the west, and we can do that only because that religion is present in the culture. We need to keep in mind that these beliefs are part of a world view only because such a world view is present in that culture.\nHowever, when these elements from a Christian world view migrate to non-religious cultures, then such elements cease being parts of a world view (because such a world view is not present in the other culture). Instead they now belong to certain domain theories, each of which is a partial description of a slice of the world. However, they also lose their intelligibility in the process: their intelligibility arises because they are parts of a world view. The need for secularism', to take but one example, makes sense only in a culture where religion claims to be the truth about the world. In the absence of such claims, the need for secularism\u0026rsquo; loses its intelligibility, becomes a mantra and is incapable of further development and elaboration.\nTo continue with the same example. It is important to bear in mind that this claim is a part of normative political theory, even in the West. However, it is also more. (In the same way religion is also more than a world view.) This additional something' is the fact that this claim is part of a world view; this something\u0026rsquo; is needed for it to make sense and thus capable of theoretical (or disguised theological) development. That is to say: the need for secularism and toleration is a part of Christian theology and that is why it is capable of development and elaboration. This Christian theology has gone secular and that is why the claim is capable of relatively autonomous development in the form of a theory. However, what enables such a development at all is that it makes sense. It makes sense because such a claim is a part of some religion. (In other words, de-Christianized Christianity can take hold and spread if and only if Christianity is present in the culture.)\nSecular' thinking people in the West (freethinkers, atheists, etc) believe that they have a world view. When pressed to say what it is, they come up with claims from several domain theories (like, say, the need for secularism and religious toleration). We can understand the situation now. Religion can also be described as a world view. These claims make some deep\u0026rsquo; sense because they are parts of the world view (only because of that do they make sense). However, these secular' people think that they are not religious. Therefore, they cannot identify their world view (religion under another description; they are not believers and therefore…). Thus, they come up with claims that appear to belong to domain theories (all human beings are equal\u0026rsquo;). When you draw their attention to this fact, they are both convinced that such claims belong to their world views and yet they cannot refute the fact that such claims belong to partial descriptions of slices of the world. Hence the unease.\nThis gives us a complex description of the secular' people in the west. They are not religious\u0026rsquo; (i.e. they are not believers). They have a religious world view (that is, they are disguised believers). The beliefs they adhere to are secularized religious beliefs (de-Christianized Christianity). These beliefs make sense only because they are part of a Christian world view (Christianity under another description). Because these beliefs are part of a network of Christian theology, they are heuristically productive to the intellectuals in the West. (That is, they make deep sense'.) Yet, the elaborations of these beliefs into theories make these theories into partial descriptions of slices of the world. (That is how they migrate to non-religious cultures.) However, within the west these theories\u0026rsquo; do not lose their bond with theology. (Hence the reason why whenever people in the west are asked to describe their `world views\u0026rsquo;, they come up with more or less the same set of claims.) And so on. We can make the situation richer and even more complex by adding the insights we gain through a study of the western culture.\nIn order to build a theory about world views, we first need to come to grips with the process of secularization of Christianity in the West. That is what we are working on. At the moment, we have a richer understanding of this process than I had when I wrote The Heathen in his blindness: Asia, the West and the dynamic of religion'. We are now able identify, for instance, that religious violence is a necessary component of the process of secularization; we also know that religious conversion necessarily involves religious violence. We think that the Protestant reformation has its roots in the process of secularization of Catholic Christianity (and it merely took the form of a religious schism) and has less to do with the disagreement\u0026rsquo; at the level of religious beliefs. (Of course, this stance is going to rewrite the history of Protestantism and is at odds with the received wisdom of the last six hundred years.) And so on.\nIn other words, the tenth chapter merely outlines a hypothesis that allows us to study the history of the western culture without getting lost in the textured and rich details that any chronicle of the past is. At the same time, it also allows us to come to grips with the nature of the Indian intellectuals, the reasons for their barren reception of western theories and such like.\n","tags":[],"title":"Secularization and world views","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/secularization-and-world-views/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","enlightenment","ignorance","Indian traditions"],"content":"Is enlightenment learnable? (In a less loaded formulation: Can all people be happy?) My answer is an unequivocal \u0026lsquo;yes\u0026rsquo;. Before we go further, we need to be clear what exactly this sentence says: enlightenment is not, say, the result of some genes (that explains why we get molars and not tusks, for instance), nor is it a law of nature (that explains why, say, water boils when heated and does not become gold instead) and so on. While individual psychology (and the combination of the chromosomes in each individual) does have a certain role to play in our lives, they cannot explain why I learnt something (say, English) at all. At best, if we are able to develop our understanding to the extent that we can explain such questions, they could explain why I learnt English slowly or mastered in two weeks\u0026rsquo; time. To understand why I learnt English, you have to look elsewhere: at my biography and not into the structure of my genes. However, that I could learn a natural language at all might be explained by evolutionary biology one day. But its explanation, in such a case, will encompass all human beings. It is in this sense that I say that Enlightenment is learnable or that all human beings can be happy. (This is something that out traditions have always taught and I think they are right.)\nWhy does someone get enlightened by one process (say, doing Sudrashan Kriya for two weeks) and another does not get enlightened (even if he does it for a year)? No one can give an answer to this question because differential learning (that is, individuals learn in different paces, to different extents, and so on) is an inescapable fact of all learning processes. We know this is true; but we do not know how to explain this. When confronted with this situation, one can take many routes: I prefer to take a scientific route.\nI formulate a hypothesis that one of the reasons for differential learning has to do with (a) the cognitive strategies used in learning; (b) whether or not what is taught hooks itself to the experience of the student. The deeper I do research into these issues, the more I learn about human beings: (c) I do more refined research into cognitive strategies that are themselves both learnable and teachable; (d) the more I try out different methods of teaching, the closer I come to the different experiences of people and the more I know about them. I have an axiom which I accept as true until the opposite is proved: whatever a human being does can be emulated by another. I might take longer to understand Einstein\u0026rsquo;s general theory than Arun, but I can also understand it. (It might take me longer; I might not see all the implications\u0026hellip;) Nothing that a fellow human being writes is inaccessible to me or to anyone else. It might only take us more work than the other, but, ultimately, I too can understand it. By saying this, I do not mean that I can learn to become a Michael Schumacher or an Albert Einstein. But I too can learn to drive a car and solve some problems in Physics (including understanding the latter\u0026rsquo;s theory).\nWhy am I merely a Balu and not an Albert Einstein? No one on earth can answer this question today; I doubt whether it is answerable in the course of the next 1000 years. However, the question does not bother me (partly because I am an Indian, I think). The question about enlightenment is different from this question.\nSo, let us say, I want to become a Ramana Maharishi or a Dalia Lama. Can I? My answer is, yes, sooner or later. I need to figure out how to go about doing it. Suppose I die before I can complete this task. What then? Here is where what we have learnt in India gives us a surprising result: I have infinitely many births within which to accomplish it. Further, because each birth builds upon the actions of this birth, none of your effort to become enlightened is wasted. You will begin in the next birth where you ended in this life. Ramana and Dalai Lama started many births earlier and that is why they are further ahead of you. What this story about \u0026lsquo;rebirth\u0026rsquo; does is to remove the possibility of the emergence of a neurotic anxiety.\nFormulating the above in my language: one might want to become happy so desperately that \u0026lsquo;wanting to find happiness\u0026rsquo; becomes a neurotic obsession and the possibility of failure generating a neurotic anxiety. The story of rebirth reduces the possibility of such an outcome, while suggesting at the same time that \u0026ldquo;wanting to be happy is the first step in being happy\u0026rdquo;. (We do not have to become obsessive about happiness: each one of us can try to be happy and become happy. No one can take this away from you.) This is one of the ways the Indian traditions prevent the possibility of a nervous breakdown.\nSo, do we need to assume the truth of rebirth? No, we do not. I do not buy the story of rebirth. However, I have the same attitude about time. I will find happiness in this life. I am certain of this because I know that it is possible and that other people have found it.\n","tags":[],"title":"Is enlightenment learnable?","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/is-enlightenment-learnable/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","basics","criticism","knowledge"],"content":"You do not want to call our natural sciences as \u0026lsquo;knowledge\u0026rsquo;. I do not even mind that. (For instance, you might want to define \u0026lsquo;knowledge\u0026rsquo; as \u0026rsquo;true and justified belief\u0026rsquo;. You might show me that our theories in natural sciences are only believed to be true and are not proved to be true. Therefore, you might want to say that our natural sciences are not \u0026lsquo;knowledge\u0026rsquo; according to your definition. Fair enough.) Since you want to conduct a discussion about knowledge and if our sciences are not examples of knowledge, I need to know whether there are other examples of knowledge. If such an entity exists, our discussions make sense. If we have no examples of knowledge at all, according to some or another definition of the word, how could we discuss about that? I mean to say, if not even the logics we use in out argument is an example of knowledge, how could we ever have any discussion about the scope, range, etc. of knowledge? We cannot. In other words, if we want to have discussions about knowledge, we need to have examples of knowledge and need to use these examples in our discussions about their nature. So, you have to tell me: (a) whether we have examples of knowledge; (b) what they are; (c) how we should use them in our discussions; (d) show that their use does not pervert our discussions about knowledge.\nLooking at the issue abstractly, such an argument might appear \u0026lsquo;circular\u0026rsquo;: we presuppose what knowledge is in order to know what knowledge is. A moments\u0026rsquo; reflection should tell you what is wrong with this impression.\nWe have to assume that \u0026lsquo;circularity\u0026rsquo; should be avoided. (Where does this piece of \u0026lsquo;knowledge\u0026rsquo; come from, or what is its foundation? How do we know this is true?)\nWe have to assume that tautologies (\u0026lsquo;p\u0026rsquo; implies \u0026lsquo;p\u0026rsquo;) do not advance knowledge. (However, is a tautology true? How do we know this? What proofs do we have for this?)\nWe have to assume as true that there is no difference between \u0026lsquo;vicious\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;virtuous\u0026rsquo; circularities.\nWe have to assume that human knowledge is not \u0026lsquo;circular\u0026rsquo;. And so on.\nHow do we \u0026lsquo;know\u0026rsquo; that these assumptions are true? What is \u0026rsquo;truth\u0026rsquo; anyway? So, you see, if you want to have discussion about \u0026lsquo;knowledge\u0026rsquo;, you need to make assumptions about its nature. In this sense, there is no possibility for us to proceed from \u0026lsquo;first principles\u0026rsquo;.\nThere is something else too. Consider the problem that a computer confronts us with. A computer can read some or another programme if and only if the operating system interprets the language of the programme. The operating system can do that if and only if the computer hands over the control to the operating system. The computer can do that if and only if the CPU has an interpreter that allows it to interpret the language the operating system is compiled in. This interpreter must itself be written in some language or another. So, we need another interpreter to interpret the interpreter. That should also be written in some language or another and therefore … and so on. So, we can conclude this is a circular problem, which has no resolution. But computers do boot, they do load the operating system and the latter does hand over the control to the programme that is called. This process is called \u0026ldquo;boot-strapping\u0026rdquo; that solves \u0026lsquo;circular\u0026rsquo; problems. This should also tell you that \u0026lsquo;circularity\u0026rsquo; appears as a problem when you assume that each sub-step in a complex task requires the same kind of intelligence that the entire task demands. (It is to the credit of Artificial Intelligence to have solved some of the long-standing philosophical problems, including the problem of \u0026lsquo;object recognition\u0026rsquo;. To recognize an object, we need to have a \u0026lsquo;copy\u0026rsquo; of the object in mind; to recognize the copy of the object, we need another copy… and so on. AI shows that we can split up an intelligent task into a series of stupid moves and generate the desired result.) Do we assume these \u0026lsquo;facts\u0026rsquo; (like running MSWord on a computer) as true in our discussions about \u0026lsquo;knowledge\u0026rsquo; or not? If yes, are we not being \u0026lsquo;circular\u0026rsquo;?

(Of course, neither Steve Farmer nor Michael Witzel shows that this is the case. But that is not the issue.) In other words, let us assume that, with respect to some or another issue, I arrive at the same conclusion as people from the Hinudtva movement do. The question is: what does that indicate, or prove or is an evidence for? After all, Witzel, Farmer and others reach the same conclusion as the Hindutva people do, when you ask them about the sum of two integers (say adding two to itself); or (assuming the presence of relevant knowledge in both) about the chemical composition of water and any number of such allied stuff. They would also (probably) agree with respect to current geography, Capitals of different nations, and so on and so forth. Why is this agreement between them and the Hindutva not suspect? Why does some or another alleged agreement that I could have with the Hindutva make me a Hindutva man?\nThere is only one answer possible in this case: there exists a unique theory (\u0026rsquo;the Hindutva theory\u0026rsquo;) from which one can derive certain conclusions. It is not possible to derive the same conclusion from any other theory that we know (or can invent). Consequently, one can argue backwards: if someone, anyone, supports a specific conclusion (\u0026rsquo;the Hindutva conclusion\u0026rsquo;) then that is because such a conclusion is derivable only from the \u0026lsquo;Hindutva theory\u0026rsquo;.

Assuming that Witzel and Farmer are not fools, they appear reasonably intelligent to me, how then could they \u0026lsquo;see\u0026rsquo; Hindutva in my writings? A more charitable assumption would be: Witzel either has not read my writings (he lies when he says he has) or has not understood them at all (which makes him dim witted).

The evidence we have says that a Paraiah was not allowed to be on the same street as a Nair, but it is not clear whether it also applies to the presence of a Brahmin. First, here is some of the evidence. The Portuguese traveler Duarte Barbosa was among the first to talk about it in \u0026lsquo;The Book\u0026rsquo;. Though written in 1518, it became known to the European world through the Italian translation in the book of travels edited by Gian Baptista Ramusio. In the English translation, we hear who the Nairs are: \u0026ldquo;None may become a Nayre, save only he who is of Nayre lineage. They are very free from stain in their nobility. They will not touch anyone of low caste\u0026rdquo; . You need to keep in mind that Barbosa does not speak of \u0026rsquo;low caste\u0026rsquo;, as an earlier footnote by the English editor and translator, Dames, indicates: \u0026ldquo;The word used in the text in vilam (villão in modern spelling) corresponding to the English villain in its ancient sense\u0026rdquo; . In other words, Barbosa appears to have seen a distinction in lineage or a distinction between the Nobility and the Rural folk when he saw the Nairs and the \u0026rsquo;low caste\u0026rsquo; people.\nOne of the more extensive descriptions of Nairs is to be found in Le Grand Dictionnaire Géographique et Critique of Bruzen la Martinière, a French writer, in 1726. Speaking about Malabar, he says: \u0026ldquo;The Malabarians are divided into two orders of people; the Nairs of Nairos and the Poliars. The former carries weapons and the others are tradesmen, workers or fishermen. The Nairos are proud of their nobility and they do not marry. The sport with the wives of other men as much as it pleases them, so much so that passionate women are free to do what they want in this land… The rest (of the population) may not even speak to them (the Nairs). If a poliar meets a Nair on the street, he withdraws himself away with much respect.\u0026rdquo; About Cochin, he says: \u0026ldquo;The Naires, or the Nobility…have big ideas about their nobility because they think that they have descended from the Sun. They do not recognize anyone as their superior except the Portuguese…They have a great disgust for the caste of the heathens one calles \u0026lsquo;Poleas\u0026rsquo;. If Polea were to come so close to a Nair that the latter can smell the former\u0026rsquo;s breath, then the Nair feels polluted and is obliged to kill the polea; because if the king came to know that the Nair did not kill the polea, then the king would kill the Nair or, if he decided to spare the Nair\u0026rsquo;s life, he would sell the Nair as a slave…In order to prevent this from happening, the Poleas continuously shout out their presence when they are in the fields so that the nairos would not come close to them…\u0026rdquo; And, much more generally, about the Nairs, says Bruzen, \u0026ldquo;these Naires are esteemed so highly that when they pass the streets, people hide themselves or withdraw until he has passed them. That is why these Nairs buy servants who could announce the coming of their masters loudly when they walk the streets\u0026rdquo;.\nLudovico di Varthema compares Nairs also with the Nobiity: \u0026ldquo;The fifth class are called Poliar, who collect pepper, wine, and nuts. The sixth class are called Hirava, and these plant and gather rice. These two last classes of people, that is to say, the Poliar and Hirava, may not approach either the Naeri or the Brahmins within fifty paces, unless they have been called by them, and they always go by private ways through the marshes. And when they pass through the said places, they always go crying out with a loud voice, and this they do in order that they may not meet the Naeri or the Brahmins; for should they not by crying out, and any of the Naeri should be going that way and see their fruits, or meet any of the said class, the above mentioned Naeri may kill them without incurring any punishment: and for this reason they always cry out. .\u0026rdquo; (Badger (1863), 141-142)\nVasco Da Gama speaks about the Nairs as a \u0026ldquo;race of gentleme,, refined in blood\u0026rsquo;, who are distinguished from all other \u0026rsquo;low people\u0026rsquo;.\nSo, yes, there is some factual evidence that Paraiahs were not \u0026lsquo;allowed\u0026rsquo; to be on the same street as the Nairs and, one supposes, the Brahmins, in Malabar region.\nYou ask whether conversion to Islam removed this \u0026lsquo;disability\u0026rsquo;. Well, yes. But listen to how Vasco Da Gama \u0026lsquo;describes\u0026rsquo; this fact; you call it \u0026lsquo;removal of disability\u0026rsquo; and he calls it \u0026rsquo;the diabolical way the Moors converted people into Islam\u0026rsquo;: \u0026ldquo;from this trade the Moors were very powerful, and had so established and ingratiated themselves in the countries of the sea ports, that they were more influential and respected than the natives themselves, so that many of the heathen became Moors, in such manner that they were more people than the natives, by a diabolical method which the Moors found; because in this region of Malabar the race of gentlemen is called Nairs, who are the people of war: they are people who are very refined in blood and customs, and separated from all other low people, and so much do they value themselves that no one of them ever turned Moor; only the low people tuned Moors, who worked in the bush and in the fields. And these people are so accursed that they cannot go by any road without shouting, so that the Nairs may not come up suddenly and meet them, because they kill them at once, for they always carry their arms, and these low people may not carry arms to defend themselves; and when they go along thus shouting if any Nair shouts to them they at once get into the bush very far from the road. The Moors, understanding that it was a good way to increase their sect, said to the King, and to the rulers of the places in which they traded, that they met with great difficulties with their merchandise, because they had not got laborers to cart it from one point to another, because the laborers, being low people, could not go amongst other people, as the Nairs would kill them whenever they met them, and therefore they would esteem it a favor if those of the low people who might turn Moors should be able to go freely wherever they pleased; since, being Moors, they would then be outside of the Malabar religion and usages, and that they might be able to touch all sorts of people; because if this was not agreed to they would not be able to transport their goods to sell them in their provinces. At the same time giving some fees tot the magistrates and confidantes of the King, they succeeded in getting this consented to. On which account these low people to enjoy so great an advantage, because they were such accursed people that they lived in the bush and in fields, where they ate nothing but herbs and land crabs, and by becoming Moors they could go where they liked, and gain their livelihood, and eat as they pleased. When they became Moors the Moors gave them cloths and robes with which to clothe themselves, and so many of them became Moors and were converted to the religion of Mohammed, and they increased so much in numbers that all the country became full of them; which caused these Moors to be very influential and powerful by their trade through all the countries, and especially in the country of Malabar, and above all in this city of Calecut, where they had their principal port for shipping pepper and drugs…\u0026rdquo; (Stanley (1869), 155-156) The reason why Moors could move around the streets freely is because \u0026ldquo;theu would then be outside Malabar religion and usages\u0026rdquo;, quite apart from their \u0026lsquo;powerful\u0026rsquo; position.\nYou ask whether the rulers of Travancore, Malabar, etc enforced this practice. I do not know about \u0026rsquo;etc\u0026rsquo; (do you mean to say, the \u0026ldquo;whole of India\u0026rdquo;?) but, yes, the rulers in Malabar (the Nairs) enforced the practice of Nairs.\nHowever, what follows from this? We can indeed notice that in Malabar and Cochin the servants of the Nairs announced the arrival of their masters such that the paraiahs and \u0026lsquo;others\u0026rsquo; would hide themselves from the sight of Nairs. Does it indicate \u0026lsquo;caste discrimination\u0026rsquo; or the better-known attitude of \u0026rsquo;the nobility\u0026rsquo; towards those who do not share this lineage? In many places in the world, the \u0026lsquo;criers\u0026rsquo; used to announce the arrival of dignitaries, nobility and so on such that those who did not \u0026lsquo;belong\u0026rsquo; would fall on their knees, hide their faces, run away and so on. Today, the wailing sirens, police escorts clear the streets when \u0026lsquo;dignitaries\u0026rsquo; travel the roads we use. I suppose this is the modern version of an older practice, even if we want to justify it as a preventive measure against \u0026rsquo;terrorist attacks\u0026rsquo;. Even if this justification is \u0026lsquo;allowed\u0026rsquo;, is this not the same action as that of the crier of a Nair in Malabar of yesteryears?\nThe \u0026lsquo;faciticity\u0026rsquo; of an alleged fact depends on how it gets described. Describe the above fact as having to do with \u0026rsquo;the caste system\u0026rsquo;, it becomes a \u0026lsquo;caste-related\u0026rsquo; fact; describe it (as these citations indicate) as a more familiar \u0026rsquo;nobility-related\u0026rsquo; fact, we can become the all too familiar bourgeois who looks down on \u0026rsquo;the feudal privileges\u0026rsquo;. Describe it as the paranoia about \u0026rsquo;terrorism\u0026rsquo;, it becomes a fact of today\u0026rsquo;s political world. Make it a question of \u0026lsquo;usage and custom\u0026rsquo;, it remains restricted to the people of Malabar of yesteryears; make it \u0026lsquo;caste-related\u0026rsquo;, it becomes a damning indictment of Modern India. So, you see, Vivenkananda\u0026rsquo;s fact is just about as worthless as the language in which he describes this story about Malabar: even if what he says about Malabar is \u0026rsquo;true\u0026rsquo;, it remains undeniable that this story about the Malabarians and Nairs was repeated ad nauseaum for more than 350 years by any number of foreign travellers and merchants before Vivekananda talks about it. Why, I wonder, did Vivenkananda have nothing to say about Calcutta, Delhi, Bombay or Bangalore? Why Malabar? Why not Chitradurga or Gurugaon?\n","tags":[],"title":"Vivekananda and Caste Discrimination: theory-ladenness","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/vivekananda-and-caste-theory-ladenness/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","basics","theory-ladenness"],"content":" Until the sixties of the previous century, there was some kind of consensus about the nature of scientific enterprise. One strand within it had to do with the nature of facts. One thought that scientists collected facts (data) and formulated hypothesis (or theories) to explain them. This distinction between theory and facts was seen as an absolute distinction: facts (or data) existed in Nature (or culture) and theories explained them. However, today, the consensus tells us that this is not the case. (This distinction has been scrutinized from many different points of view since the fifties: in terms of language, in terms of the history of the sciences, in terms of scientific revolutions, in terms of philosophy of sciences\u0026hellip;) Today, one accepts that facts are not some theory-neutral entities existing in either Nature or culture and that the distinction between them is a relative distinction. All our facts are theory-dependent; in some contexts we treat some of the claims of a background theory as facts. In another context, the same facts are discussed as theoretical claims. For instance, in some contexts, one takes the Hindus worshipping Ganesha as a fact. (This fact, for instance, functions as evidence that Ganesha is a god and/or that Hinduism is a religion and so on.) In another context, the same fact becomes an issue of theoretical controversy: are the Hindus worshipping Ganesha or not? (I challenge that nature of this fact and suggest that some kind of theology describes our actions in these terms.)\nIs this a truism? Today, among philosophers, it is. What is its status? It is also a hypothesis about the nature of scientific thinking, about the nature of human knowledge and so on. In most discussions today, one assumes its truth.\nDepending on the context of the discussion (say a dispute about some aspect of the Indian culture), the disputants can treat wearing the bindi or a saree as facts. However, in another context of the discussion, these facts might become theoretical claims. For instance, is the Indian woman wearing a bindi or an Indian male wearing kumkum on his forehead being religious or not? Consider, for instance, the recent French legislation about wearing religious \u0026lsquo;symbols\u0026rsquo; in the public. If someone decides to take an Indian to the court, then wearing bindi or kumkum becomes an issue of dispute. Then we will have disputes: one side will claim that it is religious, and the other will probably want to say that it is not religious. (If it happens, I suggest they use \u0026lsquo;The Heathen\u0026hellip;\u0026rsquo;!) In such a case, wearing a bindi will be described using two kinds of theories about wearing a bindi. Is this a post-modernist argument? No, it is not. This is an argument from the philosophy of sciences. Does it merely suggest that \u0026rsquo;everything\u0026rsquo; is constructed? No, it does not. In the first place, \u0026rsquo;everything\u0026rsquo; is not constructed by human beings: the stars and the planets for instance. Secondly, not everything that is human is also constructed by human beings: our genetic dispositions are not constructions of human beings. By merely saying that human beings construct some items (buildings and railroads for instance), nothing of interest follows.\nMy book is not about India but about the western culture. It is a study of the western culture using one thread, namely, religion. To the extent I talk about India, I do so using some of the \u0026lsquo;facts\u0026rsquo; that Indologists (and others) have so far used. My use of their facts (to show the opposite of what they believe they have shown) illustrates the consensus in the philosophies of sciences (of the last hundred years or more) that \u0026lsquo;facts\u0026rsquo; are mostly facts of a theory.

If we say that the \u0026lsquo;I\u0026rsquo; does not refer to Krishna, the empirical person, we need to say what else does it refer to. In English language, the \u0026lsquo;I\u0026rsquo; is an indexical: its reference varies according to the place, time and person. Even if it refers to something called the \u0026lsquo;Krishnahood\u0026rsquo; (the essence of Krishna), such an essence helps us identify the unique person that Krishna is unerringly. (We know who we are talking about, when I say \u0026lsquo;If Krishna were to be born in Belgium today, he would be a Belgian citizen\u0026rsquo;. These kinds of sentences are understandable if and only if the reference of Krishna is unique and does not vary.) In other words, the \u0026lsquo;I\u0026rsquo; in English is a guarantee for the uniqueness of the person uttering the indexical. In the Indian traditions (especially in the adhyatmic contexts), that is not the case. The \u0026lsquo;I\u0026rsquo; does not make us into individual persons but picks something out that is present in each entity capable of self-reference. It is only thus that we understand the beginning of the sentence in the translation: \u0026ldquo;I am seated in the hearts of all\u0026rdquo;. Krishna can be this \u0026lsquo;I\u0026rsquo; only in the sense that each organism has an \u0026lsquo;I\u0026rsquo;. Indians do not ascribe the status of an indexical to this \u0026lsquo;I\u0026rsquo;, even if it is guaranteed an invariant reference. However, the previous point can be elaborated in any number of different ways: from the Jain \u0026lsquo;I\u0026rsquo; to the Advaita \u0026lsquo;I\u0026rsquo;; from the Dvaita \u0026lsquo;I\u0026rsquo; to the Buddhist \u0026rsquo;non-I\u0026rsquo;. These multiplicities are also partially dependent on the nature of experiencing the \u0026lsquo;I\u0026rsquo;. The problem in that context is also one of elaborating the identity of the experiencer: who does the experiencing? In short, picking up a verse from the Gita or any other verse from other texts creates enormous interpretative complications. Such a task is enormously complex compared to answering the question, \u0026lsquo;What does apaurusheya mean?\u0026rsquo;\n","tags":[],"title":"Is the Bhagavad Gita a revelation?","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/is-the-bhagavad-gita-revelation/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","tolerance","explanatorily intelligible"],"content":" One has faith in God and, therefore, trusts that His message is also The Truth. That is to say, one should not predicate the attitude of having `faith in\u0026rsquo; to the EI account directly. There is a very important additional reason for being clear about our terminologies. Consider the distinction between having no idea that the Cosmos is an EI entity and having an account that makes the Cosmos into such an entity. This distinction marks the difference between the heathen and the believer. In religious terminology, the difference can also be expressed as that which exists between the \u0026ldquo;converted\u0026rdquo; and the \u0026ldquo;non-converted\u0026rdquo;. This is one meaning of the word \u0026ldquo;conversion\u0026rdquo;.\nThere is also a second meaning of \u0026ldquo;conversion\u0026rdquo;, which refers to the process only the converted undergo. In terms of my story, it picks out the degree of explanatory intelligibility the Cosmos has to one to whom the Cosmos is an EI entity. That is, the more EI the Cosmos is, the more does the believer \u0026ldquo;believes\u0026rdquo;. What is the end-point of this process? When everything that was, is, and shall be (i.e. the Cosmos) becomes explanatorily intelligible. No human being can hope to achieve this EI of Cosmos on his/her own. That is, the process of \u0026ldquo;conversion\u0026rdquo;, in the second sense of the term is asymptotic \u0026ndash; it never reaches the end-point. Of course, if that Agent whose Will is embodied in the Cosmos were to speak to the human being in question directly, this process would immediately reach its termination. In other words, \u0026ldquo;conversion\u0026rdquo;, in this second meaning, cannot be achieved by human effort alone.\nBy speaking about degrees' of EI of the Cosmos, we can pick out both the meanings of the word \u0026quot;conversion\u0026quot; and show what the difference consists of. So, the more EI the Cosmos has, the more is one intolerant of other EI accounts. (This also picks out militant Atheism\u0026rsquo; for obvious reasons.) But, as I have said repeatedly, it does not mean that each believer has to be either a missionary or a persecutor. (Simply put: intolerance is a function of the degree of the EI of the Cosmos. Among believers, the latter is proportional to the degree of faith in God.)\nReligious tolerance (interpreted as tolerance between religions) is a contradiction-in-terms. Because religion is not native to the Indian culture, to describe the relation between, say, Hinduism' and Buddhism\u0026rsquo; as one of religious tolerance is to provide a wrong description. There is, however, the issue of the relation between religions and the Indian traditions. Here, the notion of religious tolerance would mean something more than civic tolerance' because it is about tolerating\u0026rsquo; religions. That is, it is a question about the attitude of heathens regarding religions. I suggest that we dispense with the term religious tolerance' in this regard as well. So, what people call religious tolerance\u0026rsquo; is either (a) civic tolerance or (b) the ecumenical drive of religions which is inherent in religion as religious intolerance is.\nWe need to note that (a) faith and (b) intolerance are two faces of the same coin. (c) Ecumenism and (d) rivalry between religions are the two faces of another coin. In both cases, you cannot have one without the other.\n\u0026lsquo;Religious tolerance\u0026rsquo; is best described as ecumenism' (i.e. the feeling that all religions are one). In other words, there is a different relation between tolerance\u0026rsquo; and `intolerance\u0026rsquo; than we would suspect if we merely looked at them linguistically. Regarding religion, they express different phenomena.\n(a) Religion universalizes itself through two antagonistic but dependent processes: (i) the process of proselytization and (ii) the process of secularization. The first process wins it direct converts; the second process is more perfidious because the secular world comes under the grips of a disguised religious framework. With respect to Christianity, de-Christianized Christianity spreads in the secular world.\n(b) Let us look at the pole `proselytization\u0026rsquo; first. Different religious groups meet each other here. They are each other\u0026rsquo;s rivals in two senses: they are rival EI accounts; and they are rivals in winning converts. As rival accounts, they are intolerant of each other; as rivals in winning converts, they are competitors. When they meet each other as EI accounts, they do not see each other as rivals: they see that the other is not The Truth, and that the other is deficient. (In what way they are that is defined by their theologies.) However, they meet each other as rivals, when it goes to winning converts.\nWhen these religions face each other as EI accounts, their intolerance of each other is dependent on their faith in their God. So, faith and intolerance form one pole of the equation.\nThe other pole of the equation is that they see each other as rivals and at the same time feel that \u0026ldquo;religion is One\u0026rdquo;. I.e. they recognize that each is an EI account, and that each makes the Cosmos an EI entity to its believers. They are religions because they are The Truth, (i.e. there is only one Truth.) This is the pole of ecumenism.\nAt the same time, as rivals, they are each others\u0026rsquo; competitors as specific EI accounts. They are different from each other (because that is what makes them different religions) and yet the same (they are what they are because there can be only one EI account of the Cosmos.) In other words, rivalry and ecumenism constitute the other pole of the equation.\n(c) In so far as secularization is the process of spreading religion in secular clothes, in this process, religion strives to reach its level of pristine simplicity of just being the EI account.\nSo, one could say that ecumenism drives the process of secularization. But one cannot stop here. Ecumenism occurs on the basis of specific EI accounts, i.e. each EI account says what constitutes Ecumenism according to itself. That is to say, ecumenism is subordinated to the specificities of individual accounts. In other words, ecumenism is subordinated to the fact of differences between the EI accounts. Consequently, the ecumenism that drives the process of secularization has the \u0026ldquo;on the one hand and on the other hand\u0026rdquo; character: on the one hand, we are all the same, we are children of God; on the other hand, we are different from each other, we are differentiated according to our culture, race, religion, etc. The secular world, then, vacillates between these two poles: we are all children of God; yet some are better than the others. We are all the same; yet, we are not the same either. We are all the same because some are inferior to the others (because some are heathens; some belong to the underdeveloped; some are black or brown or whatever). The so-called White Man\u0026rsquo;s burden is not his burden, as I see it (even though it is also his): it is the problem of a religious-secular world, i.e., a world which becomes secular under the drive of ecumenism in religion but as that ecumenism is determined by some specific religion or the other. Better put: ecumenism, as some specific religion sees it, drives the process of secularization of that religion.\n","tags":[],"title":"Religious tolerance and Ecumenism","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/religious-tolerance-and-ecumenism-s-n-balagangadhara/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","Christianity","criticism"],"content":"X says that Christological dilemma is some kind of theological logic and suggests that ordinary Christians are not affected by this artificial problematic.\nThere are two issues here worth looking at separately.\nIs the problematic artificial? Well, it depends. I am not claiming that every Christian (past, present and future) is aware of this problematic, of course. This is a general formulation that attempts to capture the variety in Christianity as answers to some specific problem. It has the same status as some or another scientific law. Even though what we have in this Cosmos, say, are concrete, moving objects of specific size, volume, density and so on, we have laws that describe such specific movements as instances of a general law. In exactly the same way, I (partially) describe the varieties within Christianity as various answers to the Christological dilemma. Does that make my description artificial? Well, this is an issue about your own metaphysics: what \u0026rsquo;natural\u0026rsquo; is, what \u0026lsquo;social\u0026rsquo; is, what \u0026lsquo;cultural\u0026rsquo; is and what \u0026lsquo;artificial\u0026rsquo; is. All I can say is that my description does partially capture the variety within Christianity.\nAre the ordinary Christians not affected by this problematic? Of course, they are. Their particular understanding of \u0026lsquo;God\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;Christ\u0026rsquo; is how their particular tradition answers the Christological dilemma. Each Christian does not interpret the Bible ab ovo. He/She is taught by the minister, reverend, priest, etc to read and understand the Gospels in a particular way. The latter, in their turn, are trained by the seminaries (or whatever else) in theology, Christology, missiology, pastoral work, etc. Here, the answers that each tradition has with respect to \u0026lsquo;God\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;Christ\u0026rsquo;, \u0026rsquo;the Church\u0026rsquo;, etc. are taught to the aspiring ministers, reverends, priests and so on.

I answer as follows: \u0026ldquo;In that case, here is my definition: \u0026lsquo;Religion=what does not exist in India\u0026rsquo;. Will that do? If it is really a question of the definition of a word, why does one need to write such a big book?\u0026rdquo;\nThere is something both irritating and understandable about this challenge. What is irritating is the lack of goodwill and common sense among those who raise this challenge. Lack of goodwill: they do not grant me that I am aware of this possibility and that, if despite that awareness I write a book, I must have answered this question; lack of common sense: no scientific theory ever makes claims about the world simply by defining a word. It is also understandable because \u0026lsquo;definitions\u0026rsquo; have become fetishes; people think that doing \u0026lsquo;science\u0026rsquo; requires giving a \u0026lsquo;good\u0026rsquo; definition first.\nTo show that such a definition is not required, the first seven chapters of the book tell a story without defining the word \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo;. If people working with different definitions of the word understand my story, it shows that the story is not dependent on any one definition of the word \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo;.

You will get the definition of the word \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo;, when it is truly necessary to have such a definition.\nThe first chapter is actually quite important for yet another reason. The manifold citations and arguments have one goal: to raise questions, which the book seeks to answer in the course of the ensuing chapters. That is to say, I think that one of the most important aspects to being a scientific theory lies in its problem solving capacity. In the first chapter, I want to suggest that there are some genuine problems confronting the field of religious studies. To do this, I use citations and analyze them. By the end of the chapter, in principle, the field of religious studies must begin to interest you.\nNone of the problems raised in the first chapter is formulated properly. We will see as the work reaches its conclusion that we need to have some kind of theory about religion, if we are to formulate problems adequately. But this is a lesson for later.\nWhen you understand what the contradiction is, how and where it comes into being, you have grasped the first chapter. It would be even better, if you can anticipate several obvious strategies one could use to confuse the reader and convince him that there is \u0026lsquo;really\u0026rsquo; no such contradiction. The more insight you get into this evasive strategy, the deeper your insight into the contradiction will be. You will understand the import of the argument better, if you do this mental exercise.\nQuestions and answers to understand every chapter in this book\nChapter 1\n1.1. \u0026ldquo;What is the contradiction in religious studies?\u0026rdquo;\nThe contradiction in the religious studies can be put thus. The properties that make some phenomenon into religion is said to be both necessary and unnecessary at the same time. This is best illustrated by the answer to the second question.\n1.2. \u0026ldquo;I claim that a sentence of the following sort is a contradiction: \u0026ldquo;Even though Hinduism does not have a holy book, a founder, a church-like organization, etc., it is still a religion.\u0026rdquo; Could you reconstruct the steps in the argument explicitly so that the contradiction becomes evident?\u0026rdquo;\n(1) Without the presence of some properties (say X, Y, and Z) Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, etc. remain religions.\n(2) Without X, Y, and Z, they are also distinguishable from each other as religions.\n(3) Therefore, having the properties X, Y, and Z is not necessary in order to be a religion.\nNow, we bring in an empirical premise, which is true. That is, we add a fact to this chain. (This does not have any impact on the logical truth: a valid reasoning remains valid even when you add a true premise.)\n(4) Islam, Christianity, and Judaism are religions.\n(5) Without X, Y, and Z, Islam, Christianity, and Judaism fail to be religions. (This is the thought experiment we do.)\n(6) Without X, Y, and Z, Islam, Christianity, and Judaism cannot be distinguished from each other as religions.\n(7) Therefore, having properties X, Y, Z is necessary to be a religion.\n(8) Having the properties X, Y, and Z is not necessary in order to be a religion (reiterating the third step).\n(9) Both (7) and (8) are true.\nThe last statement is a contradiction.\nIt is important to keep in mind that X, Y, and Z refer to properties like: \u0026lsquo;having a holy book\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;belief in god\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;having a founder\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;having a church-like organization\u0026rsquo; etc. They apply to the entities we talk about (Islam, Hinduism, Christianity, Buddhism, etc) in exactly the same way.\nSimply put: possessing some properties is both necessary and unnecessary for some entity to become a religion. This claim is a contradiction.\nIf you like, you can also use words like \u0026rsquo;essential properties\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;determining properties\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;fundamental properties\u0026rsquo; without losing sight of the contradiction.\nSome of you might feel uneasy about this argument. Let me formulate the unease as a discussion question:\nWould the following two statements adequately capture your unease?\n(a) X, Y, and Z are necessary for Islam, Christianity and Judaism to be religions; but\n(b) X, Y, and Z are not necessary Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, etc to be religions.\n(After all, as the saying goes, there could be different kinds of religions.)\nThere does not appear to be a contradiction between (a) and (b). But what is wrong with these two statements, in the context of religious studies?\nChapter 2\n2.1. What is the ancient puzzle and how can it be solved?\nThe puzzle: how could the ancient Romans deny the existence of gods and still participate in their religio.\nThe solution: It was the Roman way to mislead the irrational masses, etc. Such solutions render the ancients inauthentic. Religio is Traditio. This means that religio is practiced because it is passed on by the ancestors, and not because of some theoretical argument. That is to say, one practices tradition because it is tradition, and no further arguments are necessary.\n2.2. What is the pagan challenge and why is it a challenge?\nThe challenge is that Christianity has to prove that it is a religio without it being traditio. Whereas the Jews could claim an ancient tradition, the Christians could not. Thus, the challenge resides in the fact that the Christian claim to be a religio, when it is manifestly not traditio of any group, cannot be justified.\n2.3. What is the Christian solution to the pagan challenge?\nConsider the pagan question: show, how Christianity can be religio when manifestly not the traditio of a group? The Christians transform this question; the transformation consists in breaking the relation of identity between religio and traditio. That is, instead of the identity between one and the other (religio=traditio), the Christians oppose one to the other: Christianity is religio precisely because it is not traditio. Traditio becomes false religio.\n2.4. What is false religion and how can religion be false?\nA false religion is the worship of the devil. Religions could be false in so far they are expressions of false beliefs.\nOn Chapter 2: some general points\nThe second chapter is crucial to the book: it just about introduces all the themes the book will talk about. There is no one particular point the chapter makes, given that it is a story. It contains many different threads: the confrontation of Christianity with its pagan milieu; its inability to understand (or its ability to misunderstand) the pagan traditions; the emergence of a philosophy of history; the theme about the \u0026lsquo;universality\u0026rsquo; of religion; the problem of Rogerius; and so on.\nApart from the story the chapter narrates, I identify some peculiarities of the meeting between the traditions of Antiquity and Christianity: the fact that the latter inscribes theology in its heart; the claim about the relation between theory and practice; the possibility of religions being false and so on.\nThe story I narrate, and the way I structure the same, is not orthodox. Despite this, the claims I make have not been contested by classicists. In fact, Dennis Feeney (a classicist at Oxford University) bases his book \u0026ldquo;Literature and Religion at Rome: Cultures, contexts and beliefs\u0026rdquo; (Cambridge University Press, 1998) on the ideas and hypotheses of \u0026ldquo;The Heathen \u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;, especially chapter 2. He considers the claims I advance about religio and traditio fascinating and important.\nThis of course means that many other classicists will (probably) contest the truth of my description of the Roman religio. However, I have not (as yet) come across any refutations of the ideas I advance in the course of this chapter.\nChapter 3: The Whore of Babylon and Other Revelations\n3.1. Explain the title of the third chapter: Who is the whore of Babylon, and what are the revelations? (You need to look into the New Testament Bible to figure out the answer.) \u0026ldquo;The Whore of Babylon and Other Revelations\u0026rdquo; picks up the story around the sixteenth century. This is the second time that the European culture comes into contact with other cultures elsewhere in the world. The first was during the Greek and Roman civilizations. Empirical investigations, if any, into the universality of religion will have to begin here – if anywhere. Indian culture is the \u0026lsquo;other\u0026rsquo; now.\nThe travel reports of this and the subsequent periods assume that religion exists in India too, except that it is the religion of the heathens. Before long, in Europe itself, heathens and pagans were to become very important. That is the first obvious reference to Protestantism in the title: we meet the whore of Babylon in the book of revelations and the former, said the Protestants, is what the Roman Catholic Church is.\nThis leads to the second reference to the Bible: the schism within Christianity, between the Protestants and the Catholics, determines the way the question of religion gets approached. The opposition between \u0026lsquo;false\u0026rsquo; religion (i.e. Devil\u0026rsquo;s worship) and the \u0026rsquo;true\u0026rsquo; one – the old drama from the times of the Romans – gets replayed with new actors.\nThe third, but not so obvious reference of the title has to do with the \u0026lsquo;revelation\u0026rsquo; that amongst these new actors is also a group called the philosophes. The Enlightenment thinkers, it is argued, not merely reproduced the Protestant themes but did so with a vengeance. The secular sons of the Age of Reason extended Christian themes under a secular guise.\n3.2. Why the title of 3.1.1, i.e. \u0026ldquo;What is \u0026lsquo;modern\u0026rsquo; about the sexual liberation?\u0026rdquo;\nIt is meant to draw attention to the nature of modern scholarship regarding the early travel reports about India. One simply assumes that whatever these reports say is a truthful \u0026lsquo;description\u0026rsquo; of what they observed; one assumes that all one has to do is \u0026lsquo;write down\u0026rsquo; what one has \u0026lsquo;observed\u0026rsquo; for it to count as \u0026rsquo;ethnography\u0026rsquo;, and so on.\nThese assumptions literally belong to the \u0026lsquo;stone age\u0026rsquo; of human knowledge: one\u0026rsquo;s observation is deeply saturated with theories, ideologies and prjeudices. There is no \u0026rsquo;neutral\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;pure\u0026rsquo; observation: either good theories guide one\u0026rsquo;s observation or bad ones do. What is amazing is that these primitive claims survive as \u0026rsquo;truths\u0026rsquo; in ethnography (of other cultures). The title ironically draws attention to the notion of \u0026lsquo;sexual liberation\u0026rsquo; by pointing out that under certain interpretations, there is nothing \u0026lsquo;modern\u0026rsquo; about it: other cultures appear to have practiced it centuries ago: only it was called \u0026lsquo;immoral\u0026rsquo; then.\n3.3. Answer, in your own words, the title of 3.3, i.e. \u0026ldquo;What has Paris to do with Jerusalem?\u0026rdquo;\nEverything: a whole series of beliefs typical for Christianity (Jerusalem) are secularized by the Enlightenment thinkers (Paris).\nThe enlightenment thinkers accept the protestant amalgam of ancient and \u0026lsquo;contemporary\u0026rsquo; heathenism as paganism. The amalgam is rendered unproblematic by positing a domain of religious experience that is universal across cultures. This is the secularized version of the idea of an innate sense of divinity.\nThe universal human history in which the Christians appropriated the past of the Jews and all others nation is secularized into a world history of Man (which is actually European history). And so on.\n3.4. What is the argumentative relevance of the opposition between primitive and abstract reasoning?\nThe concepts of primitive and abstract reasoning allow for a hierarchy of religions. The perception of the order in the universe indexes the progress of Mankind. This perception of order is made possible only by the awareness of a Divine Plan. The level of religious sophistication equals the level of abstract reasoning. Primitive man was/is incapable of abstract reasoning hence his idolatry. The dichotomy abstract-primitive reasoning is parallel to the dichotomy true-false religion.\n3.5. Explain the sub-title: \u0026ldquo;All roads lead to Rome\u0026rdquo;\nAncient Rome (and Athens) always turns up in these discussions. Both ancient arguments are rearticulated and the ancient religio serves as evidence in the Reformation debate on true religion and in the Enlightenment speculations on religion.\nChapter 4\n4.1. What is the conceptual quandary?\nWhen Europeans encountered other cultures, the concepts they could use to describe and to understand the \u0026lsquo;other\u0026rsquo; were limited: few concepts such as \u0026lsquo;heathens,\u0026rsquo; \u0026lsquo;idolaters,\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;zoolaters\u0026rsquo; would exhaust their stock of labels. Europe also lacked the tools to distinguish these traditions from one another: all \u0026lsquo;heathenism\u0026rsquo; was one. Consequently, divergent traditions in Asia, Africa, and the Americas could only be described accordingly, i.e. as \u0026lsquo;heathenism.\u0026rsquo; Subsequently, whilst making an effort to better grasp such differences, the Europeans were constrained, yet again, by their own, clearly religious understanding of traditions: they sought to uncover the heathen beliefs behind diverse traditions, sanctioned in so-called \u0026lsquo;sacred scriptures.\u0026rsquo;\n4.2. \u0026lsquo;Let 100 flowers bloom.\u0026rsquo; Explain.\nThe Protestant Reformation came to be divided into several factions itself. The title refers to the multitude of denominations which subsequently came to effloresce. It is relevant to note that these religious groups still exhibited the Protestant proclivity to refer to the heathen traditions, both Ancient and Indian, in order to prove their point. Again, paganism was to testify in disputes about the religious truth. While these Christian offshoots were caught up in discussions, polemics, and persecutions, many Christian intellectuals began to seek commonalities among these Christian competitors. It was argued that there exist some common notions concerning religion, which are both self evidently true and innate in all men. (Notions such as, existence and nature of God, connection of virtue and piety, reconciliation trough repentance …) Very soon, not only Christian communities, but also Judaism, Islam, and, still later, different forms of Heathenism were all absorbed in that one framework. This ecumenism did not, however, put a stop to Christianity\u0026rsquo;s urge to prove its superiority against other religions. Here Heathenism serves again as evidence –evidence of a most ambiguous kind.\n4.3. Explain the title: \u0026lsquo;Made in Paris, London, and Heidelberg.\u0026rsquo;\nBoth \u0026lsquo;Buddhism\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; existed, not in the East, but in the libraries of the West. They were constructed by the French Enlightenment thinkers in Paris, by the British in London, and by the German Romantics in Heidelberg.\n4.4. With reference to the theme of the book, in what sense was Romanticism a continuation of the Enlightenment?\nWhen the Enlightenment thinkers categorized the Ancient and Indian traditions, as well as the Semitic religions, into one and the same developmental scale, they continued what Early Christians, Protestants, and Catholics had done before them. The Romantics accepted this history: the distinction between concrete and abstract thought was simply replaced by \u0026lsquo;childhood\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;adulthood\u0026rsquo; in order to mould these phenomena, again, into one and the same category, i.e. religion. In addition, whilst emphasizing the close bond with nature that such primal religions supposedly displayed, the Romantics reiterated the Enlightenment explanation about the origin of religion. They strengthened the Biblical notion of an original religion by depicting India as the cradle of it. The Enlightenment categorization of all religions into one developmental scale (running from primitive to more abstract) is adopted by the Romantics with only slight alterations. Although their evaluation of contemporary Heathenisms is more positive than that of their predecessors, they still consider these as less evolved. Hence such concepts as \u0026ldquo;childhood of Man\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Cradle of Civilization\u0026rdquo;. Furthermore these concepts draw heavily on the Enlightenment idea of primitive man –a concept that has been discussed in the previous chapter.\n4.5. \u0026lsquo;On how the Buddha saved souls.\u0026rsquo; Explain.\nThe religious notion about the corruption of religion also came to mould the creation-cum-description of Buddhism. The latter was said to be a reformatory reaction against a degenerated Hinduism. Buddha was described as the \u0026lsquo;Luther of the East\u0026rsquo;, and Buddhism was to Hinduism/Brahmanism, what Protestantism had been to Catholicism. The theme of degeneration emerges a second time in this construction of Buddhism. Since only scriptural sources were used in the creation of Buddhism, this came to be seen as its pure and philosophical core, while that what existed in reality was considered to be a degeneration (i.e. popular Buddhism).\nChapter 5\n5.1. What is a paradigm? What is the \u0026rsquo;naturalistic\u0026rsquo; paradigm about?\nA paradigm is the model, constituted by a corporate body of background assumptions that lies behind and directs the theories and practice of a scientific subject. The \u0026rsquo;naturalistic\u0026rsquo; paradigm underlies the set of studies of religion which commonly refer to \u0026rsquo;natural\u0026rsquo; causes in order to account for the origin of religion. In other words, instead of appealing to the religious belief that religion is not man-made and transcends human causes, the theories within the \u0026rsquo;naturalistic\u0026rsquo; paradigm attempt to break free from theological explanations and try to provide a secular, scientific account. They do so by appealing to \u0026rsquo;natural\u0026rsquo; grounds, such as factors inherent to human nature and societies, the human psyche, etc.\n5.2. \u0026lsquo;What if there is no religion?\u0026rsquo; What is the relevancy of this question?\nIf we come across some culture that does not know of religion the statement about the universality of religion would be false. Nevertheless, we are not able to find any implications of the negation of this belief. In other words, we are not able to spell out neither the false beliefs that were associated with it, nor the consequences of its falsity. Any theory has consequences. If these consequences are falsified, the theory gets refuted as well. The absence of implications for our theories of religion hints at the fact that our theories presuppose the universality of religion – the explanans takes the explanandum for granted. Thus, the claim about the universality of religion is not part of any theory of religion: it is pre-theoretical in nature.\n5.3. What is an ad hoc explanation? What is wrong with it?\nAn ad hoc explanation is developed in order to explain one and one fact only. The explanation itself cannot be tested by the explanandum, i.e. the empirical observation, since it was groomed in order to explain that fact. A theory that cannot be falsified cannot be a scientific theory either. In the same way, the theories on religion are not tested by the presence or the absence of religion. As noted in the above, we cannot spell out the implications would religion be absent. This is problematic, because our theories have been groomed especially to explain the universality of religion whilst they presupposed the veracity of this belief.\n5.4. What are the weaknesses of our theories concerning the origin of religion?\nBesides their ad hoc nature, their weakness lies in the fact that with equal possibility one could arrive at exactly the opposite conclusions. For instance, many of the existing \u0026rsquo;naturalistic\u0026rsquo; theories can be easily encapsulated by the following idea: the primitive man, living in a chaotic world, was bound to create religion. However, it is not clear at all why the primitive man was bound to do so, since all the evidence suggests that the opposite was true: he or she would have never been compelled to experience the world as being chaotic. In addition, there is no necessity for Early Man to create precisely religion in order to render his chaotic world more orderly. Furthermore, these naturalistic theories use concepts such as scarcity, chaos, etc. as if these were experiential states, while in fact they structure experience. These and other fallacies occur in the naturalistic theories.\nChapter 6\n6.1. What is the Christological Dilemma and when did it come into existence?\nGod\u0026rsquo;s revelation in Jesus Christ poses a serious problem to Christology. The emphasis on the uniqueness of this revelation prevents it from becoming truly universal. On the hand God\u0026rsquo;s revelation is for the whole of mankind. On the other hand the revelation is unique in Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ is the way for humankind, in Him humanity finds its oneness. But, this focus on the specific nature of Christianity renders its discourse radically unintelligible to others. A way out of this quandary is to soften the emphasis on the figure of Christ and focus attention on the One who reveals Himself. Thus, allowing for multiple revelations of the divine in human history. This strategy has been employed since Early Christianity. From the moment it realized that Judaism did not cease to exist, i.e. from the moment Christianity felt the need to incorporate the histories of different peoples into its own story, attention shifted from the uniqueness of revelation in Christ to God Whose revelation is universal. Thus, the Christological dilemma –the \u0026ldquo;impossible\u0026rdquo; choice between Christology and Theism- has been with Christianity from its beginning.\n6.2. Why can the difference between the sacred and the profane not be used to distinguish the religious from the non-religious?\nConcepts such as sacred, holy, \u0026ldquo;das Heilige\u0026rdquo; do not depict experiences that are sui generis. Instead these experiences are well structured. In the case of Schleiermacher, Söderblom, and Otto this is very explicit. The religious experiences they depict imply a well- defined object, and an arsenal of theological ideas. Furthermore they presuppose a thorough acquaintance with a specific religious tradition, viz. the liberal protestant tradition. When being a part of a religious tradition is a prerequisite to have a religious experience, this experience can hardly be considered universal. Therefore, the distinction between sacred and profane, which draws on these experiences, is an intra-traditional difference and not one that cuts across traditions and time. When secular authors such Durkheim and Eliade try to characterize religion using these concepts they are actually smuggling theology into a scientific discourse, using religious categories as if they were neutral or scientific.\n6.3. Explain the title of 6.3: In what way does Christianity persecute Paganism?\nConsidering different religions to be different answers to the revelation of the divine seems to be a very liberal and tolerant stance. But, on close scrutiny, even this liberal stance is a Christian persecution of Paganism. After all, not every answer to the divine revelation is equally adequate. A (developmental) hierarchy of answers to the divine can be established, with the (liberal) Protestantism as its summit. This is but a slight variation to the well-known strategy Christianity has employed to attack and criticize different tradition. Instead of considering other religions as false or inferior, they now are less adequate answers to the revelation of God.\n6.4. Theism is a solution for the Christological Dilemma. Explain.\nIn Christology the figure of Jesus Christ poses a particular problem: the uniqueness of the revelation of God in Jesus Christ puts constraints on the universality of this revelation. It is very difficult to communicate the exclusivity of an all-inclusive Christ. By shifting focus to the revelation of God (away from Christ) it becomes possible to speak of several revelations, to incorporate different histories into one. But, this solution also implies sacrificing its distinctly Christian character.\nChapter 7\n7.1. Explain the title: what is the prosecution about? Who is the prosecutor and who is prosecuted?\nThe title of the sixth chapter refers to the fact that Christianity appears to be guilty for transforming the world into a Christian world. From the second chapter onwards, it has become increasingly clear that the world in which we live is still a religious world. Even the intellectual world of the heathens has become a Christian world. This is the pagan or heathen charge to Christianity, from which even the so-called atheists cannot escape. The prosecution, thus, is a heathen one, and those who are prosecuted are the Christians.\n7.2. Why a process? And what is the prosecution\u0026rsquo;s case.\nAs mentioned in the above, the so-called secular world in which we live is still a Christian world. Whereas the previous chapter demonstrated that our theories of religion use concepts from a specific religious tradition, the present chapter elaborates upon this point. The concepts which our scholars of religion make use of appeal to a whole range of theological beliefs. In other words, Biblical themes have been constitutive for the development of our \u0026lsquo;scientific\u0026rsquo; vocabulary: the religious belief that God gave religion to mankind has been translated into the supposed universality of religion; that He revealed himself has been transformed in the \u0026lsquo;secular\u0026rsquo; notion that in all cultures there is an experience of religion which is fundamentally the same, etc. In other words, when we talk about religion we cannot but use these themes in the absence of alternatives. Thus, Christianity, in its de-Christianised form, makes all of us into \u0026lsquo;Christians.\u0026rsquo;\n7.3. What is the linguistic inconceivability? Why is it inconceivable?\nThe linguistic inconceivability is that there could be cultures without religion. This is inconceivable to the Westerners because the only way in which they can make sense of the practices of other cultures is by construing these as religions. The language the West uses to speak about other cultures is that of a secularised Christian theology. Within this linguistic practice, the practices one encounters in other cultures threaten to become radically unintelligible if they are not described as religions.\n7.4. Which questions have been answered? Which have been postponed? Relate the questions and the answers to the different chapters.\nWe started out with the following question: \u0026ldquo;Do all cultures have religions?\u0026rdquo; This question has not as yet been answered, but we have seen that it is answered in the affirmative by the scholars and laymen of today.\nThis raised another question: \u0026ldquo;What are the grounds for believing that religion is a cultural universal?\u0026rdquo; In Chapters 3 and 4, we saw that there are no empirical grounds for this belief. The belief in the universality of religion never became the subject of an empirical investigation. Rather, all travelers and missionaries assumed that there had to be religion in India. In Chapters 5 and 6 it was revealed that there are no scientific theoretical grounds for this belief. The speculations about the origin of religion presuppose either that all human beings or all human cultures have religion. And the explanations that take recourse to \u0026lsquo;religiosity\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;religious experience\u0026rsquo; do the same. Throughout Chapters 3 to 7, it has become clear that the only theoretical grounds for believing that religion is a cultural universal are the tenets of Christian theology.\nA third question was: \u0026ldquo;What is involved in attributing religion only to some cultures?\u0026rdquo; In Chapter 5, we saw that we are not able to spell out the empirical consequences to our explanations of religion, if we discover a culture without religion. This is the case, because all these \u0026rsquo;theories\u0026rsquo; hold the cultural universality of religion as a pre-theoretical assumption.\nA fourth question was: \u0026ldquo;Is the existence question about religion susceptible to empirical enquiry?\u0026rdquo; In Chapter 5, 6 and 7, we have seen that it is not. As the concept of religion itself precedes all theory formation about religion, we have no theoretical criteria to decide whether or not some culture has a religion.\nFinally, the following question is raised: \u0026ldquo;Why have the scholars of the twentieth century kept on believing that religion is a cultural universal?\u0026rdquo; In Chapters III to VI, the historical aspect of the answer was spelled out. The Enlightenment thinkers secularized the Biblical claim that religion is God\u0026rsquo;s gift to humankind into the anthropological \u0026ldquo;fact\u0026rdquo; that all cultures have a religion. Consequently, the nineteenth- and twentieth-century scholars adopted this piece of theology dressed up in secular garb. Chapter VII explained the linguistic aspect of the answer. A de-Christianized Christian theology has become the only language in which we can discuss the various practices of human cultures. This language compels us to conceive of these practices as religions. The conceptual aspect of the answer remains to be spelled out.\nChapter 8\n8.1. What is the function of a definition?\nThe function of a definition is to provide a reference to what one is talking about.\n8.2. What issues are at stake in the dispute concerning the definition of religion?\nThere is a referential as well as a classificatory issue. By means of referring one establishes the identity of an object or phenomenon. The definition operates to avoid any dispute concerning the identification of what we talk about. The current definitions of religion, however, are used to classify certain phenomena as religion. Yet in the absence of a theory, classifications are arbitrary and do not provide us with knowledge about the world.\n8.3. Why are the discussions about definitions sterile?\nThough the discussions about the definition of religion start as a referential problem, they end up as classificatory issues. For these classificatory disputes, however, there is no possible solution in the absence of a theory. In order to classify certain phenomena as religion, one has to know what religion is. The definitions are groomed merely as an answer to the pre-theoretical intuition of the author. Hence, the definitions vary according to their tastes. Discussions about preferences and tastes are never-ending.\n8.4. Is it possible to provide counter-examples to a definition? Explain.\nNo, because definitions do not have consequences, only theories do. A definition merely associates a particular term with a given phenomenon (what is one talking about?) but they do not provide knowledge about the world. For example, suppose that one defines grass as everything that is green. Could the yellow grass that is found beneath a stone be a counter-example to this definition? No, it could not, because according to this definition this yellow grass is not grass at all, because it is not green. Now take the example of a theory of photosynthesis which explains why grass is green. Contrary to definitions, this theory has consequences or implications, one being that if grass is not exposed to sunlight for a longer period of time, it will not turn green. Hence, the example of the yellow grass under the stone confirms the theory. Suppose that one does find green grass in a dark cave, this grass would indeed be a counter-example to the theory of photosynthesis.\n8.5. What is the potential contradiction in the story?\nTo claim that religion is both pre-theoretical and theoretical. In other words, to claim that \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo; (both the concept and the claims associated with it) exclusively belongs to a religious language and theory, while simultaneously insisting that the concept and the claim are pre-theoretical in nature. The challenge will be to demonstrate that both claims are true.\n8.6. What is the definition of religion? Is it a satisfying definition? What kind of a definition is it?\nReligion is what (at least) Christianity is. This definition answers to the qualifications a definition has to meet, i.e. to fix a reference. This definition of religion picks out an exemplary or prototypical instance of religion. This allows us to study the object religion. Picking out Christianity as a prototypical instance of religion is sensible both from a historical and linguistic perspective. If Christianity would not be a religion, what else could be? Denying that Christianity is a religion involves making an epistemic decision –which requires a good theory. Furthermore, to accept that the term religion at least refers to Christianity is to begin a pre-suppositionless enquiry into the nature of religion. It does not make any domain-specific presuppositions; it merely accepts our linguistic practice. This is an ostensive definition.\n8.7. What is the problem at the end of this chapter? Why is it a problem?\nTo use Christianity as the sole example of religion might well result in an ad hoc theory of religion, in which certain characteristics of Christianity would singled out as the necessary characteristics of religion. Hence limiting the scope of the theory to Christianity alone. Only when it has been demonstrated which characteristics Christianity has by virtue of being a religion, the danger of becoming ad hoc is neutralized. This is one of the important requirements the theory of religion faces.\nChapter 9\n9.1. What is the characterization of religion?\nReligion is an explanatorily intelligible account of both Cosmos and itself. This means that the two explanations, the causal and the intentional, fall together. The cause of the Cosmos is the Will of God. All that was, is and will be is an expression of His Will. We can know God\u0026rsquo;s intentions by studying the Cosmos and His revelation. This hypothesis has to pass certain adequacy tests, which are both historical and phenomenological. Can the hypothesis explain Christianity\u0026rsquo;s inclination to religious rivalry and the mutual misunderstanding between religions and heathen traditions (historical)? Can the hypothesis explain the necessity of faith, worship, truth … (phenomenological)?\n9.2. What is the relationship between religion and the meaning of life?\nA religious person experiences the Cosmos as both a (causally) explainable and an intelligible entity. Hence, he experiences his life as a part of a bigger plan. To be religious means believing that human life and death have a meaning and a purpose. Religion makes it possible to ask these questions, but it does not provide specific answers to them. Religion was not invented to answer questions about the meaning and purpose of life, but these questions come into being within the framework of religion. These problems do not antedate religion, religion generates them.\n9.3. What is the relation between faith and intolerance?\nHaving faith means accepting that one is part of the intentions of God. Faith has two dimensions. Firstly, faith is internal to religion. Believing (in God) implies a certain attitude of piety, certain practices, a dedication and an understanding of what it means to be a religious person. Within a religion, having faith distinguishes the truly religious person from the person who merely accepts God as an explanation for the creation of the cosmos and adheres to religion\u0026rsquo;s ethical rules. Secondly, faith sets the boundaries between religion and other \u0026ldquo;religious\u0026rdquo; traditions. The truth of the explanatory intelligible account that religion is becomes important when religion finds itself confronted with other traditions. Faith allows of a distinction between those who do and do not adhere to the religious truth. To have faith is to be \u0026lsquo;intolerant\u0026rsquo;. That is, the believer cannot possibly accept that other religions are \u0026rsquo;equally true\u0026rsquo;. Of course, this does not entail that a believer is either a missionary or a persecutor. The link between faith and intolerance draws our attention to the fact that these two are related to each other the way two faces of a coin are related to each other.\n9.4. What is the relation between faith and truth?\nFaith and intolerance are two faces of the same coin only because truth is so important to religion. Being an explanatory intelligible account of the cosmos, religion has to be true –and there can only be one truth, hence its intolerance. Heathen traditions, on the other hand, are neither true nor false. These notions do not apply to them by virtue of being practical systems, developed and adopted by men as means to the truth. Religious truth, though, is God-given. This truth is not tentative, hypothetical, perspectival (as is human knowledge) and has to be accepted independently of all the knowledge we already have.\n9.5. What is atheistic religiosity? Why would it be possible/impossible for human beings?\nSomeone who claims to have religious experiences but denies the existence of God can be called atheistically religious. Instead of feeling completely dependent upon God, this person (for example) could claim to feel dependent upon the Cosmos. Although atheistic religiosity is not impossible, for human beings it is. For an explanatory intelligible account to exist and thrive in a human community, certain conditions must be met. How do human beings come by such an account, how can it be transmitted uncorrupted? For more than one reason, an entity such as God is necessary for an explanatory intelligible account to exist in a human community.\nHence, the idea of atheistic religiosity harbors a linguistic distortion. How can one feel dependent upon the cosmos – i.e. everything that ever was, is and shall be? How is it possible to feel deeply dependent on the future? As an explanatory intelligible account of the Cosmos, religion however, claims that we are all dependent upon an entity that was, is and shall be and whose intentions are embodied in the world. Hence, a religious experience involves eschatology. Atheistic religiosity, therefore, is impossible for us human beings.\n9.6. What are the cognitive moments within religious conversion? What is the fundamental mechanism for the spread of religion?\nAn individual within a tradition has no certainty that he is continuing the tradition. In the first moment, religion strengthens this notion of uncertainty: it refers to the inconsistent myths and legends that surround the tradition. However, the individual does not need these stories to continue the tradition: as a set of practices, tradition does not ascribe to the predicates \u0026rsquo;true\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;false.\u0026rsquo; As such, it is the other of religion. Religion, however, offers theoretical foundations to the practice, excavated from the set of stories that surround the practice. In the second moment, religion transforms the tradition into a variant of itself; into another religion, albeit it a false one. The falsity is expressed by the false beliefs (the stories and legends) which the practices are now said to express. In the third moment, not only one\u0026rsquo;s own set of practices is identified with the predicate \u0026lsquo;false\u0026rsquo; but other traditions are also experienced as false. In order to recap: religion spreads by effacing the otherness of the other. The other is transformed into yet another religion.\n9.7 Why is the heathen blind? How would he be able to see?\nThe heathen is blind to the truth. A religion is not just the practice that is suited for a given people: religion is the divine truth that God gave to humanity. Neither the Romans, nor the Indians understood this notion and argued along the lines of tradition and ancestral practices. Since religion generates an experience in which the world is experienced as revealing that universal truth, the heathen, outside the sphere of a religious world, cannot grasp this. In other words, in a non-religious world, the world is not experienced as explanatorily intelligible. The heathen, therefore, could not grasp an EI-account of the Cosmos and of itself. By entering the process of conversion, the otherness of other traditions comes to be the same kind of anotherness – he finally recognizes that his tradition or set of practices was an instance of false religion.\n9.8. What are the contingent characteristics of religion? Why are they contingent?\nSince for human beings, only accounts that appeal to reasons or purposes can provide intelligibility, and since religion makes both itself and the Cosmos intelligible, both need to embody the purposes of some entity or Being. This is what is called \u0026lsquo;God.\u0026rsquo; Hence the first contingent characteristic for religion in human societies: God. Secondly, humanity is part of the purposes of God. Some claim or the other must refer to those to whom God\u0026rsquo;s message is addressed. Thirdly, religion must postulate a relation between humanity and God. In other words, the message has to tell humankind what God\u0026rsquo;s purpose is and hence, what the purpose of humanity is. Accepting God\u0026rsquo;s purpose lends explanatory intelligibility to human life. Fourthly, an EI-account of the Cosmos must identify the manner in which this goal can be achieved. An EI-account speaks of the purposes of God and hence of the goal of humankind. This makes the world of the believer explanatorily intelligible. In order to retain this explanatorily intelligibility it must also refer to the means in which it can retain this. All this results in the fifth property: the doctrines in which all the above is expressed.\n9.9. What is worship? Can we maintain that \u0026rsquo;the heathen bows down to wood and stone…\u0026rsquo;?\nWorship is the means through which an EI-account retains its character. That is, it sustains a particular experience of the Cosmos. (It is also the manner in which faith is sustained.) To suggest that \u0026lsquo;The heathen bows down to wood and stone…\u0026rsquo;, we need to believe that the heathen does really think that the particular idol, the particular crow or cow, do make the cosmos (all that was, is and shall be) intelligible. Of course, to believe this fantastic story, we need more than the assurances of a hymn: we need to have an explanation of \u0026rsquo;the\u0026rsquo; psychology of the heathens that tells us how such a thing is psychologically possible. Until such stage, we cannot plausibly maintain that the heathens bow down to wood and stone, if by \u0026lsquo;bowing down\u0026rsquo;, one means that heathens worship wood and stone.\nChapter 10\n10.1. What is the relation between religion and worldview?\nStudying religion as religion forces us to accept what religion says about itself, and, hence, to practice theology. Can we solve this problem, by studying religion not as religion, but as something else, for example, as a worldview? However, religion is not only an example of a worldview, it is the only example we have of worldview. Hence, to study worldviews, we have to study religion. It is quite possible that religion is something more than a worldview, but the epistemic/epistemological differences between on the one hand worldview and theory and on the other hand between religion and theory, show us that the epistemic status of religion and worldview is the same. The minimal argument that religion is the only example of a worldview is that for over 1600 years the only thing that could possibly pass for worldview was religion. The maximal argument: It is generally accepted that worldview answers the \u0026ldquo;deep questions\u0026rdquo; – meaning of life, etc. These questions –as has been shown before- are not the precondition of religion but rather the product of it, i.e. the \u0026ldquo;deep question\u0026rdquo; can only be posed within a religious framework. If worldview provides answers to such questions it can only do so by either being a supplement to an existing religion –but then it is not a worldview- or by becoming a rival to religion. In this last case it has become an alternative religion. Worldview is the secularization of religion.\n10.2. Why is it metaphysically impossible for religion to exist in India?\nThere is a multiplicity of creation stories and claims in India. Not only within each tradition several stories persist, it is even quite normal for one and the same person to refer to different ideas about the origin of the cosmos in different contexts. Creation seems to be neither a unique, nor a radical occurrence, since all these stories are equally true and true at the same time. Furthermore, the truth of such stories does not depend on their being knowledge-claims. They are not accounts of the world, as for example the story of Genesis is. Since religion is an explanatory intelligible account of the cosmos and itself, it implies a cosmogony. This means there must be a creation story that explains the coming into existence of the world (or the cosmos) as the expression of the will of God. Moreover; this story has to be true. This means that this story tells us something about the world. Since these two conditions are not met in India, it is metaphysically impossible that there exists religion in India.\n10.3. Why is it sociologically impossible for worldview (or religion) to exist in India?\nFor a worldview to exist and keep on existing in a human society 5 conditions have to be met. These are the conditions of transmission.\nThere has to be a worldview. This worldview must exist in a textual form and members of the community have to be familiar with worldview that has been written down.\nThere has to be a standard worldview in order to limit transformations of it.\nThere has to be an authority that decides in disputes over this standard worldview.\nThere has to be an authority that exiles those that adhere to the non-standard worldview.\nThere have to be organizations that transmit and propagate the standard worldview.\nChapter ten shows us that neither of these five conditions have been met in India. In the case of the first condition there seems to be only ignorance: ignorance about a worldview, ignorance about the content of the so-called sacred books. The second condition is not met because the variety of stories is regarded as a strongness rather than as weakness. Concerning the remaining three conditions it suffices to say that no such institutions exist in India.\n10.4. Is it possible to build a scientific worldview?\nIt is very unlikely to build a scientific worldview because a worldview is a view about the world and science as we know it gives only a view of a slice of the world. However, if it were possible to construct a scientific worldview, then it would cease being science and would become religion.\n10.5. What is the double dynamic of Religion?\nThe double dynamic of religion is the dynamic of universalization by both proselytization and secularization. Religion is an explanatory intelligible account of the cosmos, including itself. However, in the world we live in, we encounter religion as different religions, i.e. as specific entities. Proselytization is how religion universalizes itself as a particular religion, i.e. by gaining converts. At the same time, religion tries to universalize itself, by secularizing itself, i.e. by losing its particular forms.\n10.6. Why is question 10.1 such an interesting question?\nThis is one reason: It turns out to be impossible to study religion without practicing theology –since religion is also what it says about itself. Even the attempt to study religion as a worldview does not help us to avoid that. The only path open to us is to study religion as something that brings forth a specific culture. This, though, is but one characteristic of religion…\nChapter 11\n11.1. What are learning configurations?\nA configuration of learning is a culture-specific way of learning. In this configuration one way of learning is emphasized and others are subordinated. \u0026ldquo;This emphasis entails that one kind of learning to learn (or meta-learning) dominates all other learning process (with their respective meat-learning). Consequently, typical to each configuration of learning is a type of learning to learn, which is the characteristic meta-learning of the kind of learning that dominates the configuration\u0026rdquo;.\nFor a human being to survive in the world, he/she needs to learn to go about with his/her environment. This environment consists both of the natural environment at larch as of the social environment in particular. Therefore, in order to survive, a human being needs to master several goings-about, to which pertains a learning process. By means of a learning process an individual can both learn to master a particular going-about as learn to teach that going-about. Hence, there is a specific learning process, covering a learning and meta-learning, for each going-about in particular. A configuration of learning is the way the several goings-about are related to one another. In other words, in a configuration of learning the one learning process is dominant and the other learning processes are subordinated to it. The dominant learning process structures, by virtue of its meta-learning, the other learning processes.\n11.2. What is the relation of religion to a learning configuration?\nBy its presence religion has generated a particular configuration of learning where theoretical learning has become dominant and where theoretical learning has subordinated the other learning processes. Religion is the root model of order. I.e. by being an explanatory intelligible account, religion itself exemplifies the order the universe is posits. Furthermore, it is the best example of what an explanation is. By its sheer presence religion stimulates the quest for answers to (meaning) questions.\n11.3. How do learning configurations help to conceptualize cultural differences?\nCultural differences are experienced at an individual level. This means that whenever we meet someone from another culture we will notice differences in how the other goes about in the world. The hypothesis of configurations of learning allows of seeking the distinctions in the different ways our goings-about are structured. Consequently, a comparison of cultures no longer consists of an enumeration of the elements culture A holds, and culture B lacks. In each culture we will find the same elements, their structure differs and the way in which they are passed over from generation to generation are different.\n11.4. What are the consequences of conceptualizing cultural differences in this manner?\nThe hypothesis of configurations of learning allows of scientific study of cultural differences. It is now possible to pose cognitively productive questions that can be answered and tested. It becomes possible to distinguish the real issues from the pseudo-issues (e.g. the universalism vs. relativism debate) The story that the hypothesis of configuration of learning offers us, is not the definitive story it can be ameliorated. This is one of its facets that makes it a scientific story.\n11.5. How to explain cultural similarities?\nSince every learning process is present in every culture, it should not surprise us there exist similarities between cultures. The hypothesis of configurations of learning allow of a description of the differences between cultures, and also of a description of the similarities between cultures.\n11.6. What is the dynamic of religion?\nThe dynamic of religion is one of both proselytization and of secularization. By means of proselytization the account that a particular religion is gets dispersed. Hereby the cosmos is made into an explanatorily intelligible entity. Secularization does the same thing but without taking recourse to a specific account. \u0026ldquo;…it is like possessing the structure of an account without oneself accepting some particular interpretation of the variables\u0026rdquo;.\n","tags":[],"title":"Chapter-wise Questions and Answers to understand “The Heathen in His Blindness: Asia, the West and the Dynamic of Religion”","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/chapter-wise-questions-and-answers-to-understand-the-heathen-in-his-blindness-asia-the-west-and-the-dynamic-of-religion/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","colonial consciousness","stories"],"content":" In many cultures, especially in the Indian case, it is important to understand that stories are not explanations. They are neither true nor false because they do not describe \u0026lsquo;factual\u0026rsquo; events; they do not claim that they do either. Unlike the Bible, the Puranas do not have to be true or known to be true for them to play the role they do in the Indian culture. The Indian myths neither allegorize virtues nor are they \u0026lsquo;disguised\u0026rsquo; histories. In other words, the presuppositions of your question (common ones in the western scholarship since the Enlightenment) are false and based on ignorance about the genre of the myth and the roles they play. (I can only assert these claims having argued them elsewhere.)\nAs an example, consider a group performing a \u0026lsquo;rain dance\u0026rsquo;. When you ask them why, in all probability you will get to hear a story. The most frequent explication (whether given by anthropologists or from philosophers or whoever) that one gets to hear is this: this group is providing an explanation about the performance of their rain dance. Assume for a moment that this is indeed the case and see what happens as a result: you are transforming the members of that group into a bunch of idiots. Is one to really think that they believe that their jumping up and down in some specific manner is the cause of the rains? Do you really think that if they were such fools, their culture could have survived at all? Ludwig Wittgenstein, in his reflections on Sir James Frazer\u0026rsquo;s \u0026lsquo;The Golden Bough\u0026rsquo;, posed the same issue in the following way: why then is the rain dance performed only during the rainy season? Perhaps, you would do well to think Wittgenstein\u0026rsquo;s question through.\nLet me sketch you a context where the story about Shiva and his Linga would be told. Imagine, just to anticipate a point I will shortly make, a family gathering in India, and a child asks this question: \u0026ldquo;Amma (mother), why is it that Shiva is \u0026lsquo;worshipped\u0026rsquo; (done puja to) only in the form of Lingam, Brahma not at all, whereas Vishnu has so many different temples with so many avataara\u0026rsquo;s?\u0026rdquo; The mother, assuming she was at home with her traditions, would tell her the exact same story you cite. She would perhaps use formulations like \u0026ldquo;Shiva \u0026lsquo;mixed\u0026rsquo; with the wives of the sages\u0026rdquo; or some such thing. If the child wants to know what this \u0026lsquo;mixing\u0026rsquo; entails, the mother would continue without embarrassment or without being perturbed: \u0026ldquo;you will know about it, when you grown up.\u0026rdquo; If the child did not know what \u0026rsquo;lingam\u0026rsquo; meant, the mother would say \u0026ldquo;what your brother has between his legs\u0026rdquo;. No one in the audience would either feel shame or embarrassment with this story, my friend. I have been both the listener and the \u0026lsquo;bard\u0026rsquo; in my own family on many such occasions that I am pretty sure that any number of others would resonate with this sketch. In other words, there is no cultural forgetfulness involved, any more than not knowing that \u0026rsquo;linga\u0026rsquo; also means penis.\nIt is important to keep in mind the question to which this story is an answer: why is Shiva worshipped in the form of Lingam, unlike Vishnu? It tells us how something came to pass, provides intelligibility to doing the puja of lingam. The most important point here is this: this story is not censored in the Indian traditions. This dovetails with an extremely important question: \u0026ldquo;If indeed there exists a paradox between the Bengali texts and the translation, how do you explain it? Why are the \u0026ldquo;unspeakable\u0026rdquo; secrets acceptable in Bengali but not in English translation? Why censorship only in English?\u0026rdquo; I leave it to you to ponder on these questions. I cannot hope to provide you an answer in the confines of this post.\nIn other words, there is no \u0026lsquo;cultural forgetfulness\u0026rsquo; involved here. If the mother tells this story without \u0026lsquo;shame\u0026rsquo; or embarrassment, the \u0026lsquo;Victorian\u0026rsquo; values are not involved in this situation. What are involved are questions like: what are stories in the Indian culture? How are they told? What do they do? Etc. To do \u0026lsquo;cultural hermeneutics\u0026rsquo;, one needs to do this kind of research before writing books.\nThis story is known to many, but it does not embarrass them.

Rather, they are beliefs about the social world which engage his attention. Suppose that Danto is right, and that the truth of his advice is independent of the culture of the audience to whom it is addressed. Suppose furthermore that thinkers from the East take this suggestion seriously as well. What would they say? They would say that the factual beliefs that the West takes for granted are too alien for them to be grafted on to the beliefs that the East holds, and in consequence the moral systems elaborated by the Western thinkers are unavailable to them. This would mean that from the intuitionist to utilitarian ethics, from Kantian to contractarian ethics, from deontological to consequentialist ethics, would all be unavailable for the Eastern civilizations. But, that is not all. The very terms in which the Western thinkers conduct their ethical discourse cannot be adopted by the East: the notions of ‘good’ and ‘bad’; the terms like ‘moral’ and ‘immoral’; the concepts of ‘moral rules’; the very idea, then, that “moral rules” are universalizable. Consider just one more extension of these implications: all moral systems which recognize that human rights are inalienable moral rights possessed by all human beings become unavailable to Eastern civilizations. Even though these are not the only consequences which follow from Danto’s suggestion, let me leave them aside for the time being to look at the issue from another point of view. Whether or not these consequences indeed follow from his suggestion depends, inter alia, upon whether there do obtain different factual beliefs that are relevant for the case. One such relevant factual belief is about the nature of human self. Do the civilizations of the East and the West have different notions of self? If yes, is it possible to assess the relevance of this difference with respect to the moral phenomenon? How does the notion of moral agency affect the construal of the moral domain? In this article, I would like to explore the answer to these questions. I want to look into the extent to which the moral systems of the West are unavailable to those of us who are from the East. I should like to, in other words, describe the western ethical systems against the background of some of the factual beliefs that we hold in the East. The Structure of the Paper This paper has four sections. In the first, I outline the conceptions of self in the East and the West and briefly contrast them. The next two sections deal with the notions of morality as I perceive them to be present in the West and the East. The final section contrasts these two views. The concluding part of this article reflects upon some of the methodological issues raised by such an exercise as this one. It has not been easy to communicate intuitions of one culture within the language of another. The paper bears marks of this struggle in more ways than one. As a transitional piece within an unconcluded project that I am working on, it is caught in the half-way house of framing the concepts of one civilization within the confines of another. This could create confusions in the reader, but I have not been able to do it differently despite the best of my efforts. Finally, I would like to draw your attention to a methodological point. Even though I am aware that many conceptions of the self and morality have been put across in the West by scholars working in several domains, because I believe that it is possible to pick out one dominant conception of self and morality, I will nevertheless speak of the Western model of self and ethics. The same applies to the East as well. The purpose of this article is not to present the views held by some group of thinkers at some period of time from either of the two civilizations, but to explicate the conception of the self and the ethical as they are present in the folk psychologies of these two cultures. Such must be the nature of these conceptions that it allows those who have them to make intuitive sense of the variety of social institutions and practices that obtain in these two cultures. This stance, however, is nowhere defended explicitly. 1. The Self in Ourselves 1.1 The Self in the West The basic conception of self in the Western culture can be very briefly outlined thus: in each human being, there obtains an inner core which is separable and different from everything else. In such a culture, when one speaks of “finding oneself” one means that one should look inside oneself, get in touch with an inner self that is there inside oneself, and peel everything away that surround this core. To such a self, even its own actions can appear strange. As Rousseau put it in his Confessions,\nThere are times when I am so little like myself that one would take me for another man of entirely opposite character.\nIt is possible to be “so little like oneself”, to be both one and the “same human being” and a “totally different human being”, if there is a self that can be like and not like one’s actions. Rousseau again:\nThere are moments of a kind of delirium when one must not judge men by their actions.\nThe actions that one is ashamed of are performed in moments of such delirium. It is by referring to the inner self that one judges men, not by looking at their actions. And it is thus that one says of oneself as well: “This is really me” or “This is really not me”. These are not just Rousseau’s sentiments alone, but those of a culture. The Western culture allows each of us a self: a self waiting to be discovered within each one of us; something which can grow and actualize itself; that which either realizes its true potential or fails to do so etc. Such a self plays many roles: it guarantees identity when philosophers ask questions about self-identity; it acquires an identity when psychologists attempt to describe the processes and mechanisms by means of which a human organism builds an identity; it is the agent of the moral thinkers when they talk of moral agency etc. Such a versatile self has various properties. One of them is its reflexivity: the self is aware of itself as a self, or it has self-consciousness. Consequently, human beings who are endowed with such selves are all self-conscious beings. As we know, most philosophers are agreed upon that self-consciousness typifies the uniqueness of human beings, and that this distinguishes Man from the rest of Nature. Involved in the talk of such a self is, first of all, a distinction between human beings as biological organisms and the selves, which they are endowed with. Secondly, consequently, human beings do not build a self, but create an identity for the self. This already existing self acquires the identity (in the sense of taking possession of it), which the human organism has built up for it. Thirdly, human beings are seen as self-conscious beings *only because ‘*inside them’ is a self which is self-conscious, and for no other reason. When I formulate it explicitly in this fashion, you may not be willing to accept the suggestion that such a concept of self is the Western concept of self. Space forbids me from going any deeper into this issue here in order to provide plausibility to my claim, but I shall try to do so later by showing that the Western notions of the ethical are simply incomprehensible in the absence of precisely such a concept of self. Or, more carefully put perhaps, this is the only way that I can begin to make sense of the Western discussions on the ethical phenomenon. Let me now turn my attention to an equally brief sketch of the notion of self in the Eastern culture. 1.2. The ‘Self’ in the East There is no better way to introduce the concept of ‘self’ as it is prevalent in the Indian culture, it appears to me, than contrast the two different ways in which the two cultures talk about persons. Consider the following questions and their answers: What kind of a person is he?\nHe is a friendly person. He comes home every week to enquire after my health. What kind of a wife is she?\nShe is a loving, caring wife. She does not eat until everyone in the family has eaten first. What kind of a student is he?\nHe is an industrious and intelligent student. He listens to everything I say with great attention. I would like to put to you that the answers marked ‘B’ are very typical of India, often very irritating to westernized sensibilities because they do not appear to be direct answers to the questions at all. The question was, not what someone does or does not do, but what kind of a person that someone is. The former may be relevant to answering the question, but that alone does not constitute an answer. This would be one response. The second response would be to say that these do answer the question, and do so directly. By picking out some or other action, it tells us that the person in question is someone who has the disposition to perform these kind of actions. One of the attributes of a ‘loving, caring wife’ could indeed be the act of eating only after everyone else in the family has had their meal. There is a third possibility which I want to explore. And that would consist of suggesting that ‘B’ does answer the questions directly, and that it is not doing so by speaking about dispositions at all. Instead, the answer is asserting an identity relation between actions and persons. That is, a distinction is not made between an agent who performs the action and the actions that the agent performs. An agent is constituted by the actions which an organism performs, or an agent is the actions performed and nothing more. And this appears to me to be the concept of ‘self’ that is present in the Indian culture. In order to better appreciate what is being said, let the dummy letters ‘X’ and ‘Y’ to stand for two biological organisms. In this case, the ‘self’ of X is nothing other than the actions that it performs. Even here, the nature and the character of the actions that X performs depends very much upon how Y construes them. There is another way of putting this: Y constructs X’s ‘self’ in the same way X constructs Y’s ‘self’. Y is very crucial for the construction of X’s ‘self’, because in the absence of Y the actions that X performs are meaningless. That is, Y is required so that X’s actions may be seen as some specific type of action or the other. If we were to restrict ourselves to X in order to talk about its ‘self’, so that we may contrast this notion with that of the West, we could say that its ‘self’ consists of a bundle of meaningless actions. Because of this, the ‘self’ of X crucially depends upon continuously being so recognized by Y. There is nothing spooky or mysterious about this: you are a son, a father, a friend, etc. only to the extent you are so recognized. And you can only be thus recognized when you perform those actions which are appropriate to the “station” of a son, father, friend, etc. The presence of these gestalts in the culture of the community not only imposes restrictions upon the way Y can construct X’s ‘self’, and thus reducing the possible arbitrariness involved in such a construal, but it also enables X to challenge Y within limits. 1.3. East and West: The Selves in Contrast Let me now contrast these cultural conceptions of selves, thus elucidating them a bit more. At an experiential level, the Western man feels the presence of ‘something’ deep inside himself even if he is unable to say what it is. Better still, he intuits a ‘presence’. By contrast, the Easterner would experience nothing, or of some kind of hollowness. To use a metaphor, the latter would experience his ‘self’ as an onion stripping of whose layers would correspond to the bracketing of others’ representations. At the end of such an operation, what is left over is exactly nothing, and that would be how someone from the East experiences his ‘self’. This experiential difference is not being mentioned in support of my claim, but only to make it intelligible. In one culture, human organisms are endowed with selves in whose nature it is to be different from one another. A human organism builds an identity (in the psychological sense) for such a self; the latter, in its turn, is what makes such an endowed organism unique. This means that the self can be individuated, and the criteria for it are precisely its possessions: at the minimum, for example, the body of a human organism belongs to the self whose body it is. In the other culture, the ‘self’ is a meaningless bundle of actions created by human organisms. The psychological identity of such a ‘self’ is a construction of the ‘other’. A human organism which builds such a ‘self’ is conscious, to be sure, but it lacks that “self-consciousness” which is supposed to typify human beings. The dividing line between such a sentient or conscious ‘self’ and other sentient ‘selves’, where it is drawn at all, is of very little moral significance. That creatures other than human beings, under such a view, end up having ‘selves’ is not only not a problem, but also a recognized consequence. The implications of entertaining such different conceptions of “self” are enormous. In the rest of this paper, I will explore some of them with respect to one domain viz., that of morality. Hopefully, such an exploration would also make it obvious why I claim that the writings on the theme of “self” are no evidence, at least not by themselves alone, for claims about the notion of “self”as it may be present in a culture. 2. An Ethical Problem and the Problem of the Ethical 2.1. Learning to be Moral? Let me enter into the theme of the present paper by trying to solicit your agreement for a shared epistemological intuition: today, we would not be willing to concede that what we know about the physical world is all there is to the world. A physicist or a logician or a mathematician is someone who is always trying to learn physics or logic or mathematics. That is, we do not call someone a physicist because he has reached a stage where no further physical knowledge is to be had. We believe, rightly in my view, that considerable though our collective knowledge of the world is, we are never finished learning about the world. There are, of course, many reasons for this belief: at least one of them has to do with the complexity of the universe that we are a part of. Consider now another broad agreement that obtains today, all controversies notwithstanding, regarding moral phenomena: morality pertains to the domain of regulating human intercourse. Each of us knows without requiring to be told that human interactions are extremely complex. One way or another, we are busy learning to go about in the world and with our fellow-human beings throughout our entire life. Consequently, we are never finished learning to be moral, or so would one think, if our epistemological intuition is applicable here, as it surely must be. And yet, I put to you, such is not the case in the Western culture today. I am not suggesting that the western culture believes that one could behave morally without learning to do so. What I want to draw your attention is to the kind of learning process that it is supposed to be. A forceful, if crude, formulation would go like this: learning to be moral involves the process of making some or other moral principles one’s own. In the process of maturing into adulthood, what one learns are these moral principles. Hopefully, in the process of learning these moral principles, one has also acquired the ability to be guided by them. (But this is not an essential constituent of learning to be moral: the ‘weakness of the will’, because of which you do not consistently apply moral principles all the time, is not considered immoral by every one.) To the extent we say that someone is still learning to be moral, we usually think of that ‘someone’ as a child who is not yet an adult. That is, the belief is that moral learning has a terminus, and an adult has this terminus behind him so that the rest of the moral life consists of successes and failures in applying these “principles”. If all there is to “being moral” is an application of a set of principles, and if there are many ‘principles’ at the market place and if, furthermore, the theories that embed or justify these principles are all fragmentary, as is the case today in the West, what does the moral life really consist of? The answer is as simple as it is unpalatable: one simply does what one feels like, with the happy realization that whatever one does is condonable/condemnable from one point of view or the other. I would like to put to you that I understate the case if I say that this is a partial picture of Western culture today. This is ‘understating’, because this situation has been blessed and sanctified with the label of pluralism. “Pluralism of values” merely hides an abysmal poverty in moral life or, even worse, a profound immorality: not many moral thinkers would consider ethical egoism as anything but immoral, and yet that would probably constitute the best description of moral life in the West. What is the notion of the “moral” in the West which has allowed this extraordinary situation to come about? What is the consensus of a culture about the nature of moral phenomenon that allows it to believe that only moral learning has a terminus? And why, in a culture obsessed with moral discussions as no other culture has ever been, has no one even posed the question whether learning to be moral could be anything other than a full-fledged learning process end only with the death of those who are the learning subjects? 2.2. Action and Moral Rule In An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals, Hume raises a question, which has always been one of the basic concerns of ethical investigations in the West: What theory of morals could serve any useful purpose, he asks, unless it can be shown that all the duties it recommends are also the true interest of each individual? There are several interesting things about this question which are of relevance to this paper. Firstly, there is a belief about the individual that he requires reasons to behave morally which is precisely what a theory of morals is supposed to provide. He requires reasons because, this is the second claim, moral rules constrain his actions. Since it is rational that each individual pursues his ‘own’ interests, any constraint placed on his behavior requires some kind of justification. Hence the third condition which every ‘useful’ moral theory must meet: the reasons such a theory provides should be shown to further the pursuit of the “true interest*”* of each individual. Fourthly, there is also a claim about the scope of morality: because it recommends duties to each individual, and what is recommended does not depend upon the unique identity of these individuals, the recommendations are valid for all human beings. That means to say, all the duties that a ‘useful’ moral theory recommends are in the “true interests*”* of each individual because of the fact that all individuals have the same set of “true interests*”*. Or what it recommends to all is in the true interest of each. These comments do not exhaust all that could be said of this question, but it is sufficient for my purposes to rest content with a slight reformulation of these observations. It is believed that it is rational for human beings to be self-interested. And because morality constrains the pursuit of a rational activity, the former requires to be rationally justified. Hence the question: is it rational to be moral rather than immoral? Or, put in a more general form, why ought I behave morally? Under this reformulation, this question is an old one: it was Glaucon’s challenge to Socrates in Plato’s Republic. Obviously it made sense then, as it does now, to ask for a justification for moral behavior. To the extent that moral rules (or moral laws) constitute the domain of morality, to seek justification for having to behave morally is, to that extent, to seek justification for moral rules. A search, in other words, for a foundation of ethics. (I would like to disregard the distinction between ‘moral’ and ‘ethical’, drawn by many thinkers, in the rest of what follows.) I would now like to suggest, simplified though this account is, that this fundamental intuition about the moral domain has been preserved intact despite all transformations and changes that the Western culture has undergone over the centuries. I would like to suggest furthermore that this picture of the moral domain, as consisting of rules requiring and having a foundation, is a deeply religious conception; and that contemporary ethical discussions, including those of the consequentialists who do not appear to fall under this description at first blush, are merely secularized versions of a religious intuition and a theological belief. (For the purposes of this paper, I will restrict myself to Christianity leaving both Judaism and those elements that Christianity absorbed from Antiquity out of my consideration.) If I can show that there is an implicit consensus in the West about what the moral phenomenon is, and that it is a Christian intuition, then Danto will turn out to be right, but for reasons that he may not have expected. Before I do this, however, I will have to state what I take to be the Christian notion of the moral domain. Given the length of the paper, I cannot but simplify it. I hope that it is recognizable nonetheless. To begin with, what makes something into a Law is that it is willed by the Sovereign. A Sovereign is the supreme authority over a domain which belongs to him. What is willed by the sovereign is Law to those ‘things’ that belong to the dominion of the sovereign, and the ‘reason’ for obedience is that the Law has its origin in the sovereign. Christianity countenances only one Sovereign, the Lord and Master of All, and His Will is the Law of the universe. This Law is the Moral Law, present in the cosmos and revealed to the authority. Obedience to it is “being moral”, because there are no other conceptions of (moral) Law and no other Sovereign. All human beings belong to the dominion of the Sovereign and, as His subjects, they have to obey His Will. There is a reason why I have capitalized Law throughout. It is to indicate that it belongs to the family of concepts, which is expressed by Das Recht and Le Droit in German and French respectively. This should suggest that what is willed by the sovereign is not only a law, but also Right. That means to say, what gives “moral” character to what is willed by the sovereign is that its origin is the sovereign. This notion contains the seed of the conflict we are very familiar with now-a-days: the ‘morality’ of legality. Because ‘Law’ cannot be distinguished from ‘morality’, the presence of more than one sovereign is sufficient to provide us with the problems we are familiar with. (To discuss this any further is, however, beyond this paper.) Consequently, some of the criticisms made against “religious ethics” do not really hold much water. Plato’s question, Whether God Wills Good because something is Good or Whether something is Good because God Wills it, is often taken to exhibit the problem with religious ethics: if the latter, it is suggested, God becomes a terrible despot and if the former, we can do without Him in our search for the foundation of ethics. This criticism would make sense if the Good can be divorced from God’s Willing, and if there was some way of understanding Good (Right) independent of The Sovereign. That, however, is not the case. The notion of Right that we have, in all interesting Natural Rights theories for example, is quite incomprehensible without the presence of the notion of sovereignty. Be as this may, none of this is immediately relevant to my concerns at the moment. What is relevant is the extent to which such a picture is required, if sense is to be made of the western notion of morality. Before proceeding any further, let me briefly return to the question of moral learning. The notion of morality that I have sketched partially explains to us why one does not learn (in any way other than making some principles one’s own) to be moral: all that moral laws can do is to impose restrictions on the choices open to an individual. Because it functions as a decision ‘rule’ used to choose between different courses of action, the requirement is that there are alternatives to choose from. How to generate the courses of action themselves? is not a question that morality addresses itself to. Consequently, the ability to create alternatives, which is what learning entails, is not acquired when one acquires moral principles. The importance of this point, I trust, will become clearer later on when we discuss the notion of ‘morality’ in the Indian culture. For the moment, what we need to see is the extent to which a religious picture undergirds this idea of morality. 2.3. The Moral Agency There is a widely prevalent belief in the West that there is a distinction between the moral domain and the non-moral one and, consequently, between a moral action and a non-moral one. What is it, then, that makes an action into a moral action? The first necessary condition to consider some action as a moral action is that it must be susceptible to a description under some or other moral rule. A moral rule is a normative statement expressing either a prohibition or an obligation. While this necessary condition might capture the intuition of the “deontological” conception of ethics, it might be said, it does not do so with respect to the “consequentialist” notion of ethics. Because such an objection, if raised, has some force I would like to reformulate the necessary condition thus: if an action or its consequences can be so described that either of the two fall under a normative description embodying an “ought”, then such an action is a moral action either directly or derivatively. This necessary condition takes care of both utilitarianism and situationist ethics under some versions: the Benthamite principle of the greatest happiness of the greatest number and Fletcher’s Agape principle. Needless to say, this condition cannot do justice to extreme versions of Casuistry or act deontologism. But even they get taken care of, when we identify the second necessary condition. Consider an act or its consequence that you would be willing to call immoral, whatever your own pet theory of moral phenomenon. In the process of attributing moral responsibility, which involves identifying the moral agent, let us suppose you are led to a computer or some sentient, but non-human being. As soon as this identification is made, you would not be willing to consider the action as something that pertains to the domain of morality any more. The reason for it is obvious: neither of the two are considered as moral agents. This provides us with the second necessary condition: an action can be moral, either directly or derivatively, if and only if it emanates from a moral agent. What is it that makes some organism, any organism, into a moral agent? At a first level, the answer is as obvious as it is inadequate: the ability to make choices. The inadequacy arises from the fact that other organisms and systems, besides human beings, appear to make choices. Consequently, a second condition is often imposed: ability to make choices based on moral principles. That is, that human beings have second-order preferences is what enables them to choose between different principles. Choices made at this level determine the object level choices made. When put this way, two points spring to our attention. Firstly, second order choices, as choices between types of choices, are not explained as causally determined ones. In some sense, such a choice is “free”. Secondly, this ability to make second order choice is not what transforms some organism post factum into a moral agent. That is, someone does not become a moral agent because he has exercised a second-order preference. Rather, it is the case that someone can exercise second order preference, i.e., choose between moral principles because he is a moral agent. That means to say that the status of moral agency is a precondition for performing a moral action. Only organisms which are moral persons could possibly perform actions that are moral. Of course, within the Western traditions it is only ‘human beings’ who have the status of moral persons. There is something extraordinary about this belief: in all other spheres of social existence, some human being becomes someone or the other, be it an industrialist or a father, only if the necessary actions are performed. But such is the definition of moral agency that your status as a moral agent is logically prior to performing any action what-so-ever. Because the very possibility of executing a moral action depends upon whether or not its origin is in a moral agent, being such an agent does not depend upon acting. If we do not empirically become moral agents, by virtue of which property (or ‘accident’ of birth) are we moral persons? Even though there are several answers (including the one I mentioned earlier on about having second order preferences), they all follow the same structure: some property is shown to be the unique possession of all members of the human species. Human beings are ‘self-conscious’, or they have language, or they are rational etc., and this is what makes them into moral persons. This can hardly do as an answer. In the same way human species differs from other species, every single species differs from every other species. An elephant differs from a gnat, the latter from a bird and the bird from a human being. Why does the typically human transform us into moral persons, whereas the ‘property’ typical of the gnats do not qualify them as moral persons? That we cannot possibly say what the ‘morality’ of a gnat consists of is not an argument to believe that gnats are no moral agents. So, Why are we moral agents? From amongst all the non-answers that I know of, there is one that answers the question by side-stepping this problem altogether. It makes discussion redundant by transforming the issue into a definitional one. That is, a moral person/agent is “defined” as someone possessing some species-typical property. While this move allows moral talk to appear ‘liberal’ in some of its versions (because it is possible to ask whether human creations, like corporations and ‘intelligent’ computers, are moral persons but, never, whether animals are), it does not make it any more obvious or intelligible. Nevertheless, this stratagem has the virtue of drawing our attention to this empirical fact: by making an appeal to linguistic conventions, support is sought in the linguistic practice that has established this convention. That is, one is indirectly referred to the way moral talk has been conducted so far. This appeal to the history of linguistic practice is an appeal to the history and tradition of the community that has spoken this way and not an other way. It is thus that we are led to the source that makes this moral talk intelligible. Consider the simplest version of this tradition: it is only because human beings have a soul, the ‘rest of Nature’ lacking one, that they are moral agents. When this talk gets fixed within the community, over a period of time it becomes obvious that only humans are moral persons. What changes, as times and tastes change, is the ‘nature’ of this property: it can now be “self”, “personhood”, “rationality” or whatever else that takes your fancy. In other words, that human beings are moral agents and that they are so before executing any moral action is not ‘true’ by means of definition. Nevertheless, it appears thus to those whose ground intuitions are Christian ones. That the terms in which Christian religion and theology set the question have ended up as things that are ‘definitionally true’ or ‘intuitively obvious’ to the practitioners of secular ethics merely shows us the extent to which secular ethics in the West are merely dressed up versions of their theological original. God and Morality History of the West, however, is not just the history of Catholic Christianity; it is also one of counter-movements, including the atheistic and Protestant challenges. (As I said earlier, the Greek, Judaic and Islamic contributions and influences are totally ignored in this paper.) How is it possible, for instance, to consider atheistic morality as dressed-up theology? Forced to be teasingly brief, I can only gesture in the direction of an answer. Western atheism is a mere negation of Western theism in exactly the same way Casuistry was the negation of Legalism in ethics. It is the other doctrinal pole which emerges within the terms set by its counter-pole. (This would suggest that atheism would be impotent when transported to a climate where its counter-pole has held no sway.) Here is just one example of how the ‘secular’ (atheistic) morality retains the ground intuitions of Christianity. (Most of what is said in this entire section is also applicable with suitable modifications.) One simply denies the existence of one Sovereign and speaks, instead, of indefinitely many sovereigns while speaking about morality: each individual sovereign’s will is the moral law to that individual. Consequently, each one of us follows his ‘own’ morality; in this sphere, there is no one higher than the agent. At this level, each individual is a God: not only because each of us is a sovereign, but because our ‘nature’ becomes identical to God. God is a creator not because He created the world; God created the world because He is the creator. His action had its origin in Him; it was ex nihilo, as is ours. The totally ‘secular’ moral theory talks about a moral agent in such terms that it structurally parallels this notion of God. To understand this kind of discourse about moral agency requires the presence of thinking thus of God. Atheism is intelligible only in relation to a theism; equally, ‘secular’ ethics of this type are intelligible only when modeled upon their theological versions. Not all ethics would accept this form of extreme ‘individualism’ or the capriciousness generated by the presence of multiplicity of sovereigns. Preferring one Sovereign instead, they seek in their ‘morality’ the _expression of the will of this sovereign. What does it matter what you call your God? Society, Genes, Rationality\u0026hellip;etc., can do just as well. A rose by any name as they say. The Moral Domain Even though what I have said so far hardly finishes the story, I can now afford to be briefer. Let us now look at two other properties that are said to constitute the moral domain as well. As we have seen, a moral law is binding upon all those who belong to the domain of that sovereign. If you have one sovereign, it is obvious that His will binds the entire world to him. The cosmos is His domain\u0026ndash; therefore, His law is universally valid. From here, how short a step it is to say that moral laws have the following ‘logical’ properties: they are obligatory, they forbid, or that they are universally compelling. A Christian belief about the range and scope of the Sovereign’s Will ends up as a ‘logical’ property of ‘moral’ statements: moral laws are universalizable. Those who deny the existence of ‘universal’ moral laws are not denying the intelligibility of this belief: where one allows indefinitely many sovereigns, there the will of these sovereigns cannot be extended to incorporate the behaviour of other sovereigns. “Relativism” in ethics is another way of carrying on Christian ethics, not the denial of the nature of moral laws or the nature of moral domain. Consider, next, the belief that moral domain is about moral values. Why is it obvious to almost every one in the West that morality involves ineluctable reference to values or norms? It could not be because it involves judgements: judgements involving ‘values’ are a special case within the class of judgements which make no reference to ‘values’. Besides, to say that morality involves ‘value’ judgements is not an answer to the question raised. Again, the only intelligible answer that I know of is the one that refers to the linguistic practice of the community, and thus to its history. In a later part (see the concluding section), I will come back to this point in order to locate the theological source that makes this doctrine intelligible. For now, I shall simply repeat what I have said before: this linguistic practice is the history of a religious talk. Do not get me wrong: I am neither prejudiced against nor positively inclined towards the Christian religion. The reason for harping on this matter so much is to suggest that the secularized versions of a theological original will appear sensible within the framework of a culture that is shaped through and through by that theology and faith. They are not a matter of linguistic stipulations that deal with the definitions of ‘words’. Much less are they ‘analytical’ statements that are true by definition. They appear so because the linguistic ‘intuitions’ have a cultural history and that, for the West, has happened to be a Christian one. Outside the Christian world and religion, there obtain other worlds, other ‘gods’ and, who knows, even other religions. To people who inhabit such worlds and cultures, embracing other “factual beliefs”, morality itself could appear differently. Danto’s advice to the West suddenly seems less ludicrous when heeded to by the East. The western notions of “ethics” and “morality” could be profoundly alien to them in the same way Christianity is. Such meta-level statements as “moral rules are essentially obligatory” or that they are universalizable etc., may turn out to rest not so much on what Ethics is about, but upon the tendency to “universalize” and make “obligatory” provincial conceptions by simply decreeing universality. And that is indeed so is a claim I want to make plausible by sketching elements from the experience of ‘moral’ domain from another culture. 3. Appropriate Morals and the Morality of Appropriateness I have already drawn attention to the notion of ‘self’ in Indian culture. In this section, I shall explicate the notion of ‘morality’ as it is embedded in this tradition. A discussion and contrast between the civilizations of the East and the West is dealt with in the next part. 3.1 Appropriateness as a Moral Category The most fundamental category of ‘moral judgement’ in the Indian traditions is that of appropriateness. That is, some action is ‘moral’ or ‘immoral’ accordingly as whether it is appropriate or inappropriate. (For the time being, I will use notions such as ‘moral’, ‘immoral’ , ‘moral judgement’ etc., in a loose way without specific connotations.) What is it for some action to be appropriate then? There are several threads in an answer to this question. Consider a biological organism ‘A’ interacting within the framework of a community ‘B’. This community is the repository of various institutions that divide up an organism’s life into easily recognizable ‘gestalts’: that is, one is a son, a father, a friend, a householder, a pupil etc. To be a son, for example, is to give form to a myriad of actions that is performed and these ‘gestalts’, in a first approximation, are preserved as a set of types of actions. No human organism can continue to live without being several of these ‘gestalts’. It is important to emphasize that these gestalts like ‘a son’, ‘a father’ etc., are not pictures or roles of an ‘ideal’ son or an ‘ideal’ father. Nor do they fully specify what it means to be a son or a father. They function, if you like, as a minimum common denominator suggesting the types of action by virtue of executing which some organism becomes a son or a father. Some organism ‘A’ becomes a son by being so recognized by the community ‘B’, and the latter does this in so far as ‘A’ performs some kind of actions. Two questions could arise at a meta-level regarding this situation: Why ‘ought’ A perform these actions? And What prevents the arbitrariness of the community B? The answer to the first question, applicable at all stages of ‘moral’ life is this: there are no reasons why A ought to perform this or any other action. I will return to this point shortly. The most important element in the answer to the second question has to do with the way in which the community ‘judges’ the action of A. In the previous paragraph, I said that ‘gestalts’ are preserved as types of actions instead of saying that they are preserved as linguistic descriptions of types of actions. This was deliberate, because, as a second approximation, what is preserved in the community is neither types of actions nor their linguistic descriptions, but ‘tokens’ of these types or models of these descriptions. That means to say, they are preserved as stories. From this primary storehouse, descriptions of types of action can be generated; but the fundamental units that divide up an organisms’s life are stories. To be a son, thus, is to perform an action for which there is a model. The medium of education and socializing is, primarily and predominantly, that of stories. To belong to a community, to be its member, is to share this basic repertoire. Over a period of time, one also learns to generate linguistic descriptions of types of action which is a convenient shorthand to talk about actions. But, actions are not judged as tokens of a type, but as those for which models obtain. It must now be obvious how the arbitrariness of the community is checked doubly: Firstly, there are no justifiable reasons why ‘A’ ought to perform any particular action; secondly, the resources that a community can use to recognize an action are those which are modeled in stories. Stories are indifferently many; so also are the states of affairs they depict. This enables any individual organism to challenge the judgement of the community, within the resources available to the community of which it is member, by being able to provide a model for its actions. Descending from a meta-level, let us look at the stories themselves. As descriptions of states-of-affairs, they are about real or fictitious sons, fathers, householders, kings etc., performing a wide variety of actions. These stories set up situations and events where moral actions take place. By following the history of an action through, these stories allow one to see how the ‘agent’ gets constituted by the actions. (Remember, an agent is the action and nothing more.) By placing one and the same type of an action in several contexts, as performed by different people, it is shown that what in one context was an appropriate one is just the opposite in another. What one learns when one is socialized through stories are not just these stories alone, but the skill of being able to distinguish between them i.e., one learns to learn in a particular way. (How stories can do this, what kind of a learning process it is etc., are questions that I cannot, unfortunately, treat within the confines of this paper.) The foregoing enables me to take the first tentative step towards answering the question raised at the beginning of this section viz., What is it for some action to be appropriate? When stories are used to ‘recognize’ an action, what is being done is the following: a state-of-affairs described by a story is being compared to some current state-of-affairs. That which is being described in a story is necessarily more complete than any given state-of-affairs for the simple reason that these stories have an end by virtue of having followed the history of an action through. The story is no standard that embodies some value, whether absolute or relative, using which some action could be branded ‘defective’ in the moral sense. Rather, the story sketches out an alternative action to the one actually performed. It could do this either implicitly or explicitly; that depends on the kind of story chosen. The suggestion is implicit when the story traces out a similar action: in such a case, it is like a thought-experiment. The suggestion is explicit when it describes an alternate action performed by some figure who found himself in analogous circumstances. Either way, the point is this: judging an action requires contrasting the state-of-affairs likely to be generated by the action with another state-of-affairs that could have been generated by performing some other action. That is, to say that some action is inappropriate (or ‘immoral’) requires that it be contrasted to some other action that could have been performed, but was not. This suggests that the judgement about inappropriateness is always relative to being able to propose an alternative action. There are several important things worth noting about this kind of judgement. Firstly, quite obviously, the unit of appropriateness is the state-of-affairs. Even though it is convenient to speak about appropriate or inappropriate action, because it brings forth a state-of-affairs, it makes no sense to ask whether the action has the ‘property’ of being appropriate. Therefore, it is not possible to request information about ‘the’ appropriate action for all contexts (except in one specific way, more about which later). Secondly, appropriateness is a comparative relation. This implies that any moral criticism must necessarily propose a concrete alternative. Consequently, such statements as “you ought not to have stolen” etc., have no moral force. Moral criticisms presuppose competence on the part of a moral critic which is one of being able to suggest a concrete alternative. (Not an ‘abstract’ one like, say, “you ought to have starved instead of stealing”.) Thirdly, this further implies that with each moral criticism that you receive, you improve the ability to perform moral actions. This is an obvious implication because any learning process requires mechanisms to localize errors, as well the possibility of learning to avoid future errors. A moral criticism that primarily involves a proposal for an alternative a is an example par excellence of how learning occurs. Fourthly, absence of any suggestions to the contrary do not make the realized state-of-affairs the ‘perfect’ one either. The ability to make suggestions is limited by the state of knowledge, the absolute novelty of the situation, the resources of the community etc. That means to say, what appears as the most appropriate action may later turn out to be a very inappropriate action. The other way holds as well. My claim is that these are some of the things one learns, when one learns through stories. Each of them has profound consequences in the way moral domain is constructed and constituted in the Indian culture. 3.2. On the Nature of the Moral Domain Moral Rules If the justification for moral actions are the stories that model such an action, it is possible (over a period of time) to generate some statements that would bear some similarity to the kind of moral rules that the West is familiar with. But, here all comparisons cease. Because stories depict the fallibility of moral rules by setting up ‘moral’ choices as choices between moral “principles” themselves, i.e. where following some moral rule is possible only by violating some other moral rule, the very notion of moral rule must incorporate its essentially fallible character. That means to say, some rule is acceptable as a moral rule if it is neither obligatory, nor forbidden under all circumstances. These two properties (being obligatory and being forbidden) are considered as the crucial properties of all moral statements in the West. An ethics that makes no rule either obligatory or forbidden, it is said, allows for the statement that everything is permitted; that, it is claimed, is the nihilist position. Could we say that Indian notion of morality is a nihilist one? Of course, we could\u0026ndash;nothing prevents us from doing so. Such a characterization would merely tell us what moral rules in India are not with respect to the western notion of morality; but it would tell us nothing about what moral rules are to the Indian traditions. Therefore, let us look at the issue this way: an individual is faced with a variety of actions he could possibly perform. None of these are either moral or immoral as such, but are susceptible to being ordered accordingly as ‘less moral’, ‘less immoral’ or whatever. In such a conceptualization, moral and immoral cease to be classificatory concepts (as is the case in western moral theories). It is important to stress here that one does not claim that because everyone is imperfect, no moral action is possible or that the moral ideal, alas, is unreachable. Rather, it is a view that is recasting the very notion of what it is to be a moral ideal in the first place. The Moral ‘Ideal’ Here, I will simply make implicit what has already been said implicitly: some ideal is a moral ideal if it is realized and is realizable. Or, to be “moral” means being exemplary\u0026ndash;in the sense of being imitable. An ideal son is one that any son can become; for this, neither moral virtue nor moral courage is required but, simply, an ability to learn. Moral figures, when pictured this way, are not exceptional figures whom but a few mortals can follow, but exemplary individuals whose path can be traversed by all. Given that we find ourselves in different sets of situations, there would be, in a manner of speaking, as many moral ideals as our stations in life differ. By the same token, what would be a moral ideal for a householder cannot be seen as one by a student. In this sense, to speak of the moral ideal, the way one does in the West, is literally senseless when viewed from within the context of Indian culture. Moral Agency If both the ethically good action, and the ethically bad one are absent from the Indian conception of morality, it would appear that there is no incentive to be a moral creature any more. And, by the same token, the question Why ought I be moral? does not appear to elicit any answers. Would this not be a weakness in the conceptualization of the moral domain? Because moral domain encompasses all the actions of an organism, there is indeed no ‘special’ incentive required to perform moral actions: one is in an ethical domain all the time. The ‘incentive’ to execute actions that produce the most appropriate state-of-affairs is the belief that the agent is constituted by the actions of the organism. This incentive, as it is captured in the notion of ‘rebirth’, which is not quite as superstitious as it is made to appear, replaces notions of moral responsibility, moral retribution and desert. It attempts to accommodate two fundamental ideas: that an agent is his actions, and that the latter have long range consequences stretching beyond the life-span of any single organism. It has as little to do with the idea of ‘transmigration of souls’ or with ‘metempsychosis’ as the Indian notion of morality has to with Western nihilism. No ‘reason’ other than the belief about the nature of human ‘self’ is required as a motivation to perform moral actions. That means to say, the theory of ‘karma’ emerges as a component in the theory of personal identity. Where the self is constituted by the actions, there the Socratic question Why ought I be moral? is a senseless one. There is no answer to it because the question is unintelligible. Furthermore, as must be obvious from the foregoing, the judgement about appropriateness is not a value judgement. Like all non-moral (in the Western sense of moral) comparative judgements, it is a claim about the world. Consequently, the kind of ‘relativism’ that is implied by this position has to do with the limited knowledge we have of the world. Because moral judgements are factual claims and empirical discoveries, it is possible that there obtains a learning process which is comparable to any other learning process we know of. It is as difficult to speak of a terminus for moral learning as it would be to learning physics. If there is no ‘perfect’ moral knowledge to be had, it is not possible to execute either ‘the good’ or ‘the bad’ action either. Therefore, all that can be said of any state-of-affairs is that it is both good and bad. Not that it is good from one perspective and bad from another, but that if neither the appropriate nor the inappropriate state-of-affairs obtain, any state of affairs that is likely to emerge will be a combination of the two (to the extent it can be thus formulated). By saying this, one may appear to licence any action; to this constantly recurring problem I shall return from another perspective, when I contrast the East and the West. Needles to say, these beliefs do not stand isolated: the notion and perception of order that the universe is, the notion of knowledge, truth and practice etc., form a mutually supporting network. 3.3. ‘Detached’ Action as Moral Action Let me address myself now to three kinds of meta-level problems all of which can be partially satisfied with one and the same answer: (a) First, a challenge. If actions are indeed meaningless, what does it mean to choose between two courses of action? Even if the desired state-of-affairs is the reason for the choice, to the extent it makes the action derivatively meaningful, the ‘agent’ allegedly constituted by the action is a creation of the organism itself and not the community. From here, it is but a short step to the West because one is endowing the organism a set of preferences. Irrespective of how the organism acquires these preferences, it is after all the organism which exercises the choice\u0026ndash; according to its values, norms or, if you prefer, some preference criteria. It is difficult to see why a suitably modified rational choice theory cannot accommodate this description. (b) Second, a query. Even if moral judgement is comparative, surely it must be possible to formulate a general advice for those who would like to perform the most appropriate actions at all times? Even if universally valid moral rules are not available, without a general set of heuristics it would be difficult to learn/know what kind of action should be performed. If there is no decision rule, is there a learning strategy? In other words, a trans-contextuality appears necessary amidst the total contextualism. (c) Third, a doubt. To what extent is what is provided a description of Indian culture? Given the variety of religions and caste groups in India and the absence of references in the article, it becomes difficult to assess the scope of the claims. I would like to begin with the doubt: if it is indeed possible to ‘derive’ from my claims (in some quasi-sense of the term) at least one doctrine central to all traditions in India, then my suggestions regarding Indian culture would gain credibility. Secondly, in so far as such a common/core doctrine obtains, it establishes the possibility of giving a ‘general’ advice. The nature of this advice would give us clues about its trans-contextuality or otherwise. To answer the first question, however, I need to go into the doctrine itself. If, as I have said several times, actions are meaningless (outside of contextual interpretations) and moral actions, as actions, become appropriate within contexts, then the ‘desire’ to perform moral actions should be identical to the desire of wanting to perform appropriate actions in all contexts. That is to say, the demand would be to look for and propose some one kind of action that could be appropriate no matter in which context it would be performed. Because actions are always performed in contexts, the task is to seek the context of all contexts and for an action that is appropriate in that context. There is one such context, which is the context of all contexts viz., the universe. Actions performed in sub-contexts would inherit the ‘property’ of being appropriate, if they instanced that action which, when performed against the context of the universe, had the property of being appropriate. All organisms, however, are always within some context or the other and, consequently, all their actions always have some meaning or the other. Consequently, what kind of an action would be appropriate within the context of the universe and in what way could we speak of such an action generating an appropriate state-of-affairs? Let us begin at the other end, the one we know better, to see whether this question can be answered. Suppose we look at human species as an individual with a history of actions. What significance does the universe lend to this individual’s actions? If one does not believe that we were ‘created’ for fulfilling some divine purpose or the other, then there is but one answer we can give to the question: viz., none! Actions have no purpose, no meaning, no goal. If, in other words, you were to systematically abstract from the meaning that the local contexts lend, and place l actions only within the ‘master’ context, your actions would be totally meaningless. At such a level, it makes no sense to ask whether some action is appropriate or not: all actions are equally appropriate, none is and neither of the two. Any action that can duplicate or reproduce this ‘property’ of total meaninglessness would turn out to be the most appropriate action in all contexts. One of the characteristic properties of human actions, it has been maintained in the western traditions, is its goal-directedness. Aristotle suggests that moral actions aim at eudemonia and, therefore, that the knowledge of this good is required to achieve it. Kant, for instance, made this property the cornerstone of his ethics: the sole motivation for performing a moral action should only be that of performing it because it is moral. Needless to say, all varieties of moral traditions necessarily assume this goal-directedness one way or another: a consequentialist focuses upon the consequences or desired state-of-affairs etc. Given this background, What does it mean to perform meaningless actions? It is to perform an action without desiring, without wanting or even without aiming at any goal whatsoever. One simply acts. In other words, an action that does not carry the allegedly specifically human property of intentionality would be the same as performing a meaningless action. Or, as all the Indian traditions put it, performing an action without any kind of desire, without aiming at any kind of a goal, without attaching this intentionality to human action is the highest kind of action that is appropriate all the time. Even though different traditions defend this doctrine in several ways, they all agree that such actions, if performed, would constitute the most appropriate action in all contexts. That is to say, a truly trans-contextual action can only be an action exhibiting the generic property of action: goal-less, a-intentional. This does not mean that the organism, which is always in some context or the other, chooses between two alternatives: that of performing an intentional action and that of performing a meaningless action. It merely means that the organism acts; it acts because as an organism it acts whether it wants to or not. It neither desires to act this way, nor is it averse to acting the other way. To put it very crudely: if you are ‘seen’ as a son, perform the actions that are ‘expected’ of you. You do not execute them because you want to be a son, or because it is appropriate that a son does them, or because of anything else. You execute them without any becauses\u0026ndash;you just act, period. Or, if an organism acts without any kind of preferences\u0026ndash;such an organism would perform ‘appropriate’ actions all the time. There is no ‘meta-preference’ of being indifferent to outcomes or goals that characterizes such an action: all kinds of preferences are quite simply suspended. But, it might be said, such a goal is a normative one: one ought to be a-intentional all the time, but it is not the case that the organisms are in fact thus. One ought to perform goal-less action, but human action is always goal-oriented. Consequently, in what way is this different from any other moral ideal that is current in the West? The answer is simple: one ‘ought’ to be a-intentional simply because human action is a meaningless action. Erroneously and acting under false beliefs, human beings think that action is always goal-oriented. They do not see that the context lends purpose, goal or meaning to human action. Contexts range from a local one of performing some specific action to the global one of being born into a network of social arrangements. It is these that make human actions appear meaningful, when in fact none are. Why ‘ought’ one just act? Because that is in fact what is. To realize this truth about human action is to be liberated from ‘errors’. When viewed this way, it is obvious that choice theories of any sort would not do to express this notion of ethical and moral action. Total suspension of all choices is the first requirement to be a ‘moral’ (used in the sense of an “enlightened” or “liberated”) person. Whether such a view can be maintained or not, I believe to have made a case for defending the description that I have given so far as one that approximates the Indian notion of ‘self’ and ‘morality’. It is not enough, to be sure, but it is a beginning nonetheless. 4. Moralities: the East and the West in Contrast All organisms act; their actions are meaningless and the ‘self’ constituted by this set of meaningless actions is itself meaningless. The context lends meaning to actions and, thus, an identity to the ‘self’ so constituted. Therefore, some organism is a ‘self’ as long as there exists a context (a network of social arrangements) that continuously recognizes a self. An organism which sees this truth simply acts\u0026ndash;as all organisms do. Let us now go to a meta-level. If actions are indeed meaningless, why call/consider this attitude that encourages one to act utterly ‘oblivious’ to either the consequences or rules or to anything else a moral attitude at all? One could, with equal justification, call such an uncaring attitude absolutely immoral as well. For example, it allows you to carry out genocides\u0026ndash;as long as you just do them and without caring. After all, it is totally meaningless as an action! Surely, this consequence alone discredits any claims that such a theory could make to being a moral theory? But of course, it is logically possible to call it a thoroughly immoral attitude. You could, equally well, call it an attitude that is beyond both good and evil. Danto, in the book from which I cited at the beginning of this article, says as much:\nNot to care,\u0026hellip;a problem with Gita as a moral tract, verges on not being quite human.There is something chilling in the image that the Gita creates as we approach the end:..they move through the battle field with that half smile of the inturned face of Indian art as they slay their way dispassionately across the field of conflict, as though they were cutting their way with scythes through a field of wheat. It is not a pretty picture. It is a picture, however, of a self that has located itself beyond good and evil. That is a dangerous space. It has been occupied by Nietzsche’s superman and by those who thought themselves as supermen. It is not a moral stand, but a stand outside morality\u0026hellip; (p.98-99; all emphases mine)\nSome relatively minor points require to be made regarding Danto’s description, before I can address myself to the question at hand. The above stance is not “outside morality”, but outside the notion of Western conception of what it is to be moral. It is a moral stand, but these cultures differ with respect to the notion of morality they use: it is not the case that Indian and Western culture have different moral rules such that what we (in India) call ‘moral’ is not considered so by the West. We are, in fact, talking about different phenomena when we talk about morality. (I shall explore some of the implications of this last statement later.) That some notion of moral behavior can be called both totally immoral and as non-moral should alert us not to the undesirability of such a notion of morality, but to the possibility that something is wrong with this kind of challenge. A moral practice, and notions about what it means to be moral, is interwoven into and supported by other practices of a community: the notions of ‘selfhood’, the processes of learning, the experience of ‘body’, ‘space’ and ‘time’ and all those others which support and sustain a notion of the moral domain. Therefore, the challenge is not whether some notion is logically ‘air-tight’, but to understand how this logical possibility fails even to be a logical alternative within the framework of a culture. How, while appearing to license every action, does a culture manage to sustain itself? Why no genocides in a culture that, ‘logically speaking’, should have no problems with it? Let us array the historical facts to make this point. A culture obsessed with morality has been the author of deeds that ‘ought’ to chill any one’s blood: Crusades, Jihads, inquisitions, witch huntings, colonizations, genocide of the American Indians, Nazism, transforming a continent and culture (viz. Africa) into slaves\u0026hellip;the list is virtually endless. Cultures which absolutely forbid immoral actions appear to have brought forth such immorality that it takes an enormous amount of good will to entertain the possibility that these cultures are not intrinsically ‘evil’. A culture that apparently occupies a ‘dangerous space’, occupied by Nietzsche (speak of anachronisms!), appears relatively virginal by contrast. (‘Virginity’, here, is relative: the claim is not that Indian culture does not know of tortures, wars or cruelties\u0026ndash;assuming, for the moment, that they are ‘chilling’ deeds. The suggestion is that they pale into insignificance when compared either in magnitude or in scale to the acts that the West has inflicted.) What are we to make of this empirical history of the last two thousand years? There is a reason to raise this question. The very fact that Danto advises the Western audience about the impossibility of adopting the Eastern morality, but does not even as much as implicitly suggest that it goes the other way as well, testifies to the strangeness of the situation we are in. Philosophers talk blithely about the universalizability of moral rules, the ‘is-ought’ problems, the nature of the ‘good’ and what-have-you without even pausing to reflect whether the very idea of the ethical domain itself varies across cultures. If what we, in India, call ‘moral’ is outside the ‘moral space’ for you, How do we perceive/understand your notion of morality? How must we (in Africa, Asia) perceive your understanding of morality, when you do everything you preach ought not to be done? What are we to make of a ‘debate’ when sanctions against South Africa (to give just one example out of an infinite list) is defended by one group as a moral act, and by those in power as an immoral one? There is but one conclusion possible: ‘moral’ talk is pure rhetoric and a total license to act immorally but feel sanctimonious at the same time. The white man, as the saying goes, speaks with a forked tongue. Succinctly put, it would probably appear to us that Western morality (in all its versions) is totally immoral and simply a stick to beat others with. The perusal of ethical literature that the West has produced simply reinforces this impression. The standard ethical examples are so grotesque (like the botanist Jim facing the ‘dilemma’ of himself having to kill one Indian or letting the Captain kill 10 Indians in a Latin American town) that it is scarcely credible to see them considered as paradigmatic examples of ‘ethical’ dilemmas built to test the strengths of moral theories and ethical intuitions. But that they are seen this way raises two questions: either ethical thinkers do not encounter moral problems in their daily lives\u0026ndash;Why else the paucity of examples and the starved diet?\u0026ndash;or their ‘theories’ never help them solve their moral problems. In both cases, they point to the irrelevance of ‘morality’ to daily life in the West. This is a problem not just of theories, but of a notion of morality. If such is the notion of morality that all you could have is either an ‘ethically good’ or an ‘ethically bad’ or an ‘ethically neutral’ action, the demand is always to provide one of these. If it is the case that such neatly packaged actions do not come, What are the consequences? There is only one answer: You do exactly what you feel like with the realization that you could always ‘defend’ the action as an ethically good one; or you do exactly what you feel like because you do not believe that such neat packaging is possible; or you do exactly what you feel like while suggesting that every one ought to do the same; or you do exactly what you feel like\u0026hellip; An intuition that absolutely forbids immoral action gives one no practical choice but to be totally immoral! The knife appears to cut both ways: against the background of the western conception of ‘ethics’, Indian traditions ‘chill the blood’. Against the background of Indian traditions, the West appears totally immoral: Why does it appear so? What causes this perception? 5. In Lieu of a Conclusion When we describe the moral domain of other cultures, the fundamental categories that organize this description are those from our cultures. Even though attempts are often made to depict the moral domain of other cultures as ‘accurately’ as possible, the terms that structure such a portrayal are drawn not just from one’s own moral domain. Implicit conceptions from and about various walks of life function as the backdrop within which the other’s moral domain gets accommodated. It is almost as if one fits a partial description of the moral domain of another culture within one’s own world view. This procedure distorts such a description beyond all recognition: no amount of ‘good will’ prevents the other from appearing grotesque. Consequently, given different supporting sets of social practices and institutions that are present in another culture, what should appear as an intelligible way of life is presented not only confusingly, but also as a reprehensible form of life. More than little care, therefore, is required in describing the ‘moral’ domain of another culture. What, in any case, will not do are facile assumptions and cavalier attitudes like the one Danto expresses when describing the possibility of existence of different moral ideals in India:\nAn Indian will always excuse the actions of a man belonging to a different caste if it is provided in the moral beliefs that belong to define the man’s caste, even though they are proscribed by his own caste\u0026hellip;Imagine, for example, that there is a caste of thieves. There is honor amongst them, to be sure. But are we required to tolerate them on the mere grounds that they are thieves? There is no basis for moral discussion whatever if there is no sense of everyone belonging to the same general community within which differences may be tolerated.. (p.44-45)\nObvious as it may be to Danto, it is not so to me: What makes it so counterintuitive to the tradition, which Danto is a part of, to tolerate the ‘thieves’ and ‘their morality’ on the grounds that they are thieves? Secondly, what makes it equally obvious to him that in India there is no sense that “everyone” (the universal quantifier) “belongs to the same general community”? When Indians say “everyone”, they literally mean everyone; the quantifier includes in its scope such entities as birds, bees, insects etc. On the other hand, when the West speaks of “everyone”, the term includes only those who are capable of behaving morally and that, they believe, is what only human beings (not even all the members of the species) can do. Because we have already seen the extent to which this is a typically Christian belief, there is no necessity to rehearse the issue here. But this is the place, however, to redeem the promissory note about the relation between moral domain and norms. One of the vexing problems within Christian doctrine has been about human salvation: are only a few destined for it? Many? Or all? Religious figures were split on this issue\u0026ndash;raising as it did questions about the nature of divine will. Splinter movements within Christianity have split according to the answers given to this problem. Whatever the answers, it is important to note that this question did make sense, and continues to do so. The minimal agreement among various positions appears to me, as a layman, to be this: some ‘exceptional’ act (or, at the least, some kind of an out-of-the-ordinary effort) is required to ‘merit’ salvation. For nearly 2000 years, the Christian faith has believed in this sentiment. My point, with respect to secular theories, is this: the notion of moral individuals is isomorphous with this belief. One requires courage, virtue or integrity (or whatever else) to be a moral individual. Moral figures are, somehow, exceptional; they are what ordinary mortals can never be. As such, they embody an ought. A culture that believed and debated about the nature of God’s will, which willed the salvation of the few, for thousands of years can hardly jettison this belief when it takes to secular morality: it takes the form of ‘exceptional’ individuals embodying an ‘ought’; they are seen as being outside the ‘is’. To be moral requires some ‘exceptional ability’ or the other. It is this belief that makes Danto say the extraordinary things that he does say. The problem is not merely one of presenting or studying another way of going about in the world as a form of life to those who live it. There is a deeper issue involved, one which I can only touch upon. Consider this compelling intuition that we all have when we study, say, another culture’s conception of morality (or self, or whatever): while ready to acknowledge differences, we believe that it is merely a different conception of the same domain. Our terminologies vary, our partial descriptions are different, but the reference of these is assumed to be the same. However, when the intuition gets worked out in some detail, it is not at all obvious that we (in these two cultures) are talking about the same domain. By taking this article as a case in point, if we were to put the descriptions of moral domain next to each other, it is impossible to avoid the equally compelling conclusion that they could not possibly be of the same domain. (Unless, of course, one of the descriptions proves to be ‘false’. But, then, it is hardly clear how, and in what sense, culture-specific conceptions of ‘ethics’ could be false.) Are the different words, different partial descriptions indicative that the subject matter itself is different? Both of these views, each pulling in opposed direction, appear to be true: the belief that there are different conceptions of “self” and “morality” etc.; the belief that these could not possibly be different descriptions of the same ‘domain’ but of different domains. An analogy might well help us here. Human beings could be studied differently by molecular biology, genetics and microphysics. Psychology, Sociology and Economics claim to describe the same object as well. If we take this analogy, the eastern and western conceptions of “self” and “morality”, say, would be as different from each other as a sociological and psychological description of some human phenomenon would be. That is, these culture-specific conceptions are appropriate at different levels. Should we look at it this way, neither moral nor cultural relativism would be implied, much less the ‘incommensurability’ of cultures. We would then be advised to use different words when describing the moral domain of different cultures. This would satisfy one intuition, but not the other. There are two reasons why it is so: firstly, what would the upshot of following such an advice be? Are we to say that Indian culture is not moral, because morality, for example, requires ineluctable reference to values? This language “ one that calls other cultures either immoral or amoral “ is all too familiar to us; there is no reason to rehearse the problems involved in such a talk, especially given the kind of dominance that the West intellectually enjoys. Secondly, the intuition is that different conceptions of morality are not different from each other the way Psychology is from Sociology, but that they are about the same domain and at the same level of description. Why, otherwise, would most writings in Anthropology and Comparative Sociology continue to speak of different cultures having, say, different categories of ‘person’, ‘group’ etc.? Words like ‘person’, ‘group’ do not function as place-holders or variables, but as concepts with specific references. How are we going to make out whether or not we are talking about the same domain, same object and at the same level of description? Does not this problem, applicable to a whole range of other concepts, make the entire project even more complex? What are the issues? How shall we proceed to solve them? These, I believe, are the genuine issues that underlie much of the pseudo-debate around the problem of cultural relativism. We have, to this day, not laid ‘relativism’ to rest, because we cannot formulate the issue (as yet) that gave birth to relativism. This lack of success, as I see it, arises due to absence of the foundation required to formulate the problems. And that foundation will not be laid unless as descriptions provided by other cultures of both the West and themselves against the background of their cultures. It is only when that task is accomplished will we know what the problems are. I believe that it is time that other cultures do to the West what the West has done to them viz., study the latter anthropologically. My paper expresses this belief. Like all first steps, it is hesitant, unsure and imbalanced. Experience, no doubt, will bring the requisite skills. At the end of the day, when others learn not only to walk but to run as well as their western counterparts, it is any body’s guess what social sciences will look like. It is my hope to have shown that the prospects are daunting, but the possible results (should the attempt prove successful) appear to make it all, oh so, worthwhile.

Comparative anthropology, as a discipline, studies and contrasts, where such contrasts are possible, the different ways in which human beings organize their lives, think about and experience both themselves and world around them. A culture is a form of life and, as such, it is a way of going about the world. One would therefore expect to find a deep and intimate relation between action sciences on the one hand, and studies of culture on the other. A perusal of literature, however, shows the fact of the matter to be different.\nDifferent in which way? It is not necessary to speak here about the attempt of anthropologists to relate both their theoretical and ethnographic work to theories of action; many anthropologists and few anthropological quasi-schools have felt and continue to feel the need to integrate theories of human action in their approaches to the study of society. The same, it would appear, cannot be said of action theories. As a rough way of establishing the interest that action theorists show in this matter, let us notice the kind of themes they take up for investigation; the relation between action and intention, between actions and events; the nature and properties of efficient and inefficient action, the rational and irrational action etc. A great deal of familiarity with the literature in this tradition is not required to observe that neither anthropological theories nor ethnographic studies play any role in their discussion.\nWhy is this so? Here is one possible answer; the problems that are taken up for scrutiny are invariant across cultures and, consequently, there is not much that anthropology can contribute to this enquiry. This stance is implicitly assumed by most; perhaps, if called for, they would also defend it explicitly. There is, however, a second way of looking at this issue; the themes that action theorists address themselves to are the deep and ground intuitions of one specific culture, viz. The West. To the members of this culture, it is obvious that human action, by virtue of being human, exhibits some typical, species-specific properties such as being intentional, goal directed, rational or whatever else that you may want to attribute. Not only is it natural speak about human action in these terms, but to look at it any other way would be so deeply counterintuitive that it does not appear plausible. In so far as most western anthropologists share this basic intuition, there is not much in their field work that could contribute to the discussion. After all, they too are framed within the descriptive possibilities open to this culture.\nWhile both these answers shed some light on why action theories are indifferent to anthropology, the second carries a rather disturbing implication: It suggests that what the action theories study are not so much human actions (in their species typical generality) as a culture-specific mode of acting. And that there are other modes of acting and other ways of going about the world which may not exhibit any/most of the properties that human action are supposed to have. Consequently, if action sciences are to exist as \u0026lsquo;sciences\u0026rsquo; at all, it is advisable that they look at the way other cultures act and at other forms of life.\nIn this paper, I want to examine whether the second answer could turn out to be both intelligible and sensible. (I shall leave the question of its truth aside.) I shall do so by very briefly looking into a notion that pertains to the domain of action theory viz., action-knowledge. I will suggest that the notion of action-knowledge within the western tradition, by and large, has come to mean knowledge about actions. My claim will be that this is not what action-knowledge is. In such a case, we need to understand why action-knowledge has come to mean what it means. Lending credibility to this claim requires that we develop a more adequate notion of action-knowledge. Both purposes could be fulfilled, I shall suggest, by looking into the practices across cultures. In the following pages, I shall endeavor to lend some plausibility to these suggestions by looking specifically into one culture, viz., India.\nTo provide a degree of intelligibility to these claims is the aim; detailed arguments and elaborate defences are as much outside my ken as they are beyond the province of this essay.\nThe structure of the paper\nThis paper has six sections. In the first, I introduce the problem that, more or less, forms the thread that runs throughout: Why is there an absence of theoretical treatises about social practices in a culture like India, when it has got what is manifestly the most complex form of social organization that human history has ever known? This question is not answered directly, but functions as the background within which other issues are raised. In the second section, I suggest that learning is related to culture and examine one of the elements, viz., the experience of order, which plays an important role in the kind of learning process that a culture develops. In the next two sections I outline a notion of learning and claim that as a mode of learning it is specific, if not unique, to Indian culture. The properties of such a learning process, which creates action-knowledge, are examined in the third section. While at it, some empirical hypotheses are generated to show the heuristic potential of this approach. In the two parts that comprise the fourth section, I take up the problem of comparison: How culture specific is the notion of action-knowledge? I examine one domain that belongs to the realm of human action, viz., the ethical in the first part. In the second, I compare the notion of action-knowledge with the most familiar notions of knowing how and knowing that. The problems that arise as a result of such a contrast function as the theme of reflection in the last section.\nAs a part of an unconcluded project I am working on, this article merely expresses some working hypotheses that appear rather productive. As a project, it has the ambition of wanting to formulate the intuitions of one culture within the language of an other. As an article, its aim is not to convince but to persuade. Could it be, I want to ask, that we may fruitfully look at the issues in a way we are not accustomed to? What would it be like; I want you to ask yourselves by the end of this article, if cultures could learn to really look at each other?\n1. Raising a problem: knowledge and social life\nTo any one who has some first hand knowledge of India, the conjunction of the following three phenomena must appear both extraordinary and striking: Firstly, its social organization (viz., the so-called caste system) exhibits enormous complexity, manifests some kind of an order and touches every walk of life. It is a social organization under whose scope falls not only the mundane and minutiae, but also the deeper and the lofty. And yet, no Indian could tell you much about the \u0026lsquo;principles\u0026rsquo; of this system, leave alone the dynamics of its reproduction. Theories about this social organization, one that has had a history of more than two thousand years, are not to be found within the Indian tradition. Of course, many treatises about the \u0026lsquo;caste system\u0026rsquo; have been authored by Indian intellectuals during this century. My point is that theorizing about the \u0026lsquo;caste system\u0026rsquo; is neither indigenous to the tradition nor inherited from it, but a learned and acquired mode of treating the subject. Secondly, each of the \u0026lsquo;caste\u0026rsquo; groups in India appears to have an enormous repertoire of \u0026ldquo;do\u0026rsquo;s\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;don\u0026rsquo;ts\u0026rdquo;. Again, were you to dip into the literature of the Indian tradition expecting to find complex reasonings and justifications to support any one set from this variegated, hardly overlapping sets of \u0026lsquo;injunctions\u0026rsquo;, you are likely to draw a blank. That is, individuals perform a great variety of moral actions and there appears to exist many action alternatives without a correlated corpus of justificatory literature. Thirdly, neither the social institutions nor the moral practices are founded upon centralized authorities: be they religious, moral or political. In other words, absence of knowledge about practices is not supplanted by the presence of authorities whose cogitations could make debates and arguments superfluous.\nWhat, you may wonder, is problematic about the coexistence of these three phenomena in any one society? The answer would be evident, if we were to indulge in a comparison. Contrast the situation sketched above with that of the West regarding some similar domain, say, that of the ethical. Consider, for example, the total number of moral principles (or \u0026lsquo;injunctions\u0026rsquo;) in the West with the amount of literature produced about them. These injunctions, each of which is formulated and defended as a general principle, do not (probably) number more than twenty. But the literature about them stretches to infinity. With respect to India, it would be difficult to make any such claim; it is not clear whether the \u0026lsquo;injunctions\u0026rsquo; are general principles or not; one does not know how many injunctions exist and, as I said, there is hardly any justificatory literature.\nWhat are we to make of this? Here are two possible responses from among many:\n(a) Because Indians have no comparable moral theories (comparable, that is, to those of the West) they really have no notion of \u0026lsquo;good\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;bad\u0026rsquo;. Therefore, they are immoral. Not many would say it in quite this fashion, even though many still think so. This does not merit an answer.\n(b) They are arrested at a primitive stage of moral development, even if they have stumbled upon some fundamental moral principles. This is a self-defeating response: if a culture has \u0026lsquo;stumbled\u0026rsquo; upon such principles and every individual from each generation over thousands of years continues to stumble upon it, moral practice does not require to be supported by ethical theories. By the same token, the existence of theoretical treatises about moral practices in a culture is hardly indicative of its maturity.\nIt is only by leaving such or similar responses aside that we are better able to formulate the issue that a culture like India raises. Let us do so by looking at some facts. The Indian caste appears to have survived (in whatever form, and through whatever mechanisms) many fundamental upheavals: through challenges posed by internal movements (like Buddhism etc.) to externally imposed economico-political reorganizations (Islamic invasion, British colonialism and subsequent integration into a world capitalist system). That is to say, \u0026lsquo;caste system\u0026rsquo; appears to have adapted itself to changing environments over the course of the centuries. This is a statement that one could make without having to prejudge the \u0026lsquo;desirability\u0026rsquo; or otherwise of such an organization.\nClearly, the minimum that is required for such an adaptive social organization is that some kind of knowledge present in society and that it be available to its members. Knowledge must be present, because the actions that reproduce a way of living are knowledgeable actions and cannot be either random or purely explanatory ones. Furthermore, because these actions enable a social organization to adapt itself, they will have to be informed actions. And because what is adaptive over thousands of generations is one and the same organization, which is a creation of infinitely many actions of indefinitely many individuals, each member of such a form of life must have access to this knowledge. Otherwise, there would be no continuity between generations and hence no culture either. Given that Indian society has some such thing called culture and some kind of a history, the question must now be fairly obvious: If knowledge about these practices is not what there is, what other kind of knowledge is it? How is such knowledge transmitted through the generations? How do individuals learn it? How does this enable them to sustain a very complex form of social interaction?\nThese questions have rarely been raised in the literature, be they philosophical, sociological or anthropological. Most of the studies about the Indian \u0026lsquo;caste system\u0026rsquo;, for example, have assumed the presence of some or other \u0026lsquo;principles\u0026rsquo; underlying and supporting the \u0026lsquo;system\u0026rsquo;. These studies have also excavated and brought to light many such principles: from non-egalitarian principles through hygienic principles (albeit in a metaphysical form); from transactional rules through rules of coalition formation to the very propensity of human beings to maximize fitness through extended nepotism, etc. This is not the place to discuss the veracity of any of these studies. And yet, I mention these attempts because it is relevant for the concerns of this paper to ask why this approach has been the dominant one at all. That is, why is it assumed that knowledge about human practices is the best way to understand human ways of going about the world? In this paper, I begin to answer this question as well, by trying to link notions of knowledge and ways of knowledge acquisition to the nature of cultures. Thus, a philosophical quest, viz., that of clarifying some conception of knowledge begins and ends as a project in comparative anthropology.\n2. Culture, learning and paradigms of order\nIs it plausible to accept the idea that the way the members of a group learn is intimately connected to the culture of that group? In this part, I shall provide a brief positive answer by looking at one element that plays an important role in linking the mode of learning to the culture of a group.\nAs human beings, we are socialized within the framework of groups. In its broadest sense, \u0026lsquo;socialization\u0026rsquo; refers to the process of living with others. Who these \u0026lsquo;others\u0026rsquo; are, and what it means to \u0026rsquo;live with them\u0026rsquo; are things that a human organism learns when it gets socialized. That is, socializing process involves transmitting this knowledge, which is practical in nature. The customs, lores and traditions of human groups not only preserve this knowledge but are also the mechanisms of its transmission. What a learning process is, when viewed from the point of view of he organism that is being socialized, is a teaching process from the point of view of those responsible for socializing that organism. The teachers, thus, draw upon the resources of the culture to which they belong.\nConsequently, the methods of teaching an organism will teach only to the extent they dovetail with the process of learning. Because we, as human beings, are not genetically determined to learn in any one particular way, it could be safely held that the teaching processes give form to the way an organism learns about environment. That is, the way one learns is non-trivially dependent upon one\u0026rsquo;s culture. We may, therefore, accept the idea that not only the what but also how of learning is connected to the culture of an organism\u0026rsquo;s group. All of the above claims appear extremely reasonable. As we shall soon see, it also appears possible to generate a culture-specific notion of learning, which is able to shed light on a diverse set of phenomena that are characteristic to a culture.\nSeveral elements are of direct relevance to the way a culture teaches, and to the way its members learn: the experience of \u0026ldquo;self\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;others\u0026rdquo;; the experience of \u0026ldquo;body\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;space\u0026rdquo;; etc. Unable as I am to discuss any of these, I shall restrict myself to just one element from the set, viz., the experience of order.\nIf construed rather broadly, learning can be seen as the way an organism makes its environment habitable i.e., it is an activity of making habitat. The fashion in which this takes place, however, depends on the experience the organism has of the environment that has to be made habitable. One of the fundamental differences between cultures is the manner of structuring this experience and that, I suggest, take place through the mediation of some or other paradigm or root model of order. Let me explain.\nAlmost all cultures inculcate and preserve a sense and feeling of order within their members. It is almost as if each generation teaches the following truth to the next generation: cultural systems are not the \u0026lsquo;intended\u0026rsquo; results of the actions of its members. Both the order in one\u0026rsquo;s culture and the order that the cosmos is share the property of not being and planned products of the actions of its members. The awareness that actions of its members are necessary to maintain the cultural order and that actions, somehow, can either sustain or disrupt these orders is also present in most cultures.\nHowever, what distinguishes one culture from another is, among other things, the way this sense and feeling of order is preserved. Quite obviously, some way of preserving a sense of order can continue to preserve only to the extent it ceaselessly structures the very experience of order itself. That is to say, \u0026lsquo;preserving the sense of order\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;structuring the experience of order\u0026rsquo; are both descriptions of the same process but from two different points of view; each generation preserves it\u0026rsquo;s experience of order by structuring the experience of the next. A way of preserving a sense of order can structure an experience of order, it appears to me, if it itself models or represents or explicates that very order whose experience it is supposed to structure. In other words, that which structures the experience of Cosmos as an order must itself, in some way or another, exhibit or express the order of the Cosmos. I call such a prototype of order, the primary root model of order. What distinguishes cultures from one another, under this construal, would be the nature of their paradigms of order.\nMy suggestion is that \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo; has been the paradigm of order for the western culture. According to the account given above, it would mean that \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo; both structures the experience of the universe and is itself an instance of that order. Now, whatever \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo; might be, it is without doubt true (If, that is, Judaism, Christianity and Islam are what religions are) that it is explanatory. That means to say, the structure and the strategy of religious explanations both structures and sustains an experience of order that that universe is. Because the finer and subtler points about the nature of religious explanations are not relevant for this paper, let me crudely outline the three basic phases which culminate in the sense of order that I consider typical for, if not unique to, the West.\nThere is the first phase, I suppose, of a \u0026lsquo;pre-religious\u0026rsquo; experience of the world. In this phase, there is an experiencing of the constancy and regularity of the universe. The second phase denies this experience of order and draws the attention to the chaos the world actually is. In the third phase, there is a discovery of a \u0026ldquo;deeper\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;underlying\u0026rdquo; order beneath the chaos of the phenomenal world. What happens in this process is that the first experience, the naive experience of order, is totally bracketed away, leaving behind only the chaos that the phenomena experience is supposed to be until the deeper order is discovered. The obviousness and the all pervasiveness of this attitude is expressed in the way child development was conceived until recently, and in the way the emergence of \u0026lsquo;mythical\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;magical\u0026rsquo; thinking is accounted for. A child\u0026rsquo;s world, it was surmised, is a \u0026ldquo;bloomin\u0026rsquo;, buzzin\u0026rsquo; confusion\u0026rdquo; until it learns to conceptualize, categorize and speak. And we are told that our ancestors attempted to find \u0026rsquo;explanations\u0026rsquo; for natural phenomena because they were confronted by a chaotic world i.e. by the occurrence of \u0026lsquo;random\u0026rsquo; events. Even the arguments for the existence of God took the form of \u0026ldquo;arguments from design\u0026rdquo; in the hands of the medieval naturalists and theologians. The fundamental attitude, in other words, is that if there are no \u0026ldquo;laws\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;principles\u0026rdquo; underlying an experiential world, such a world will have to be a chaotic and unordered world.\nConsider now another culture, where such or similar paradigms of order do not exist. To its members the above suggestion would appear strange: neither \u0026lsquo;chaos\u0026rsquo; nor \u0026lsquo;deeper laws\u0026rsquo; are experiential units to this culture. The universe is experienced as an order: neither a creator nor His design requires to be invoked as the \u0026lsquo;reason\u0026rsquo; for this order. Explanations may try to say what the order consists of; but the truth or otherwise of these explanations arc irrelevant to the fact that the universe is an order. That is to say, the world does not embody or express an order (or anything else): to speak of the world, to experience it, is to experience order. For this to be true, it would require that such a culture have a root or primary model of order which is not explanatory in nature. Nevertheless, it must be ordered and that order must be visible on the \u0026lsquo;surface\u0026rsquo;. The truth or falsity of the many different \u0026rsquo;explanations\u0026rsquo; (\u0026lsquo;interpretations\u0026rsquo; would, perhaps, be a better word in this context) must be irrelevant to answering the question whether such a root model is an order. That is to say, in such a culture, the root or primary model of order must be pre-linguistic (or non-linguistic) in nature. A set of actions, with a beginning and an end (neither of which need be an absolute), following each other contiguously in time would constitute such an order. India is one each culture, I want to claim, and its paradigm of order is not religion but something else. Call it, for the sake of convenience, Ritual.\nUnder this construal, Religion and Ritual are two fundamental paradigms of order or two fundamental ways of structuring the experience of the universe. This does not require that the other mode (ritual for one, religion for the other) is absent in either of the two cultures: they exist, but as subordinate moments and hence as almost unrecognizable counterparts. A religious ritual is as different from Ritual as ritualistic religions are from Religion. We shall have an opportunity to relive this problem again, but in another form later.\nGiven this, the problem that occupies the intellectual energies of one culture is: given that the universe is an order, how to perform actions that better fit the order? In an another, it takes a different form: What is the nature of the order such that one may perform the action that require to be performed? How, asks one culture, to perform actions and continue to improve them such that the order does not disintegrate? In an another, the order is not \u0026lsquo;visible\u0026rsquo;: it is a \u0026ldquo;design\u0026rdquo;; a \u0026ldquo;law\u0026rdquo; that lies hidden beneath. Knowledge of this order would allow one to decide about the right action that requires to be performed in indefinitely many contexts. These two paradigms of order, that distinguish these two cultures, shed some light on the way the problem of action is treated: to know one has to act in one culture; to act one has to know in another.\nMy suggestion is that these paradigms of order, in their turn, enable the emergence of culturally dominant modes of learning. In a culture like India, this leads to a learning process whose main focus it is to develop the ability of performing and improving actions. The knowledge that the members of such a culture have is what I shall call action-knowledge. In the next two sections, I shall go a bit deeper both into the kind of knowledge that action-knowledge is and into the nature of learning process required to acquire such a knowledge. Contrast and comparison with the West will be attempted subsequently.\n3. Action-Knowledge and exemplary learning\nThe proposal that I shall outline in the rest of this paper is the following: Action-Knowledge (or Practical Knowledge) is a species of knowledge that is distinct from theoretical knowledge. The process of acquiring this knowledge involves mimetic learning i.e., learning through exemplars. Exemplars are different from examples and, therefore, the process of learning through exemplars is not the same as learning through examples i.e., It is not some kind of inductive learning. Action-Knowledge, on this ac- count, is not knowledge about actions; neither is it the same as acquiring some skill or the other. In the next section, I shall look at the properties of practical knowledge and the consequences that follow when proposed as a culture specific mode of learning.\n3.1 Stories as models\nOne of the characteristic properties of Indian society, something which strikes everyone with more than a vague acquaintance of this culture, appears to be its incredible variety and stock of stories. Inundated with stories, its people appear to relish the act of telling stories: there are stories for every situation; all \u0026lsquo;reasons\u0026rsquo; and \u0026rsquo;explanations\u0026rsquo; require stories and their presence is as ubiquitous as the very air itself. Clearly, if a child is constantly exposed to stories at all levels of social interaction, they end up playing an important role in the very process of socializing itself. So, whatever be the roles that stories play, it is reasonable to assert that they are vita] ingredients in the process of learning to live with the others. That is, in. such B culture, stories would have to function as units of a learning process.\nBy virtue of which property can stories play the role that I suggest they do? I am rather hesitant to ascribe any internal or intrinsic properties to stories that enable them to be units of learning. I do not think that it makes a great deal of sense to speak of unite of learning outside a specific learning process. However, given a specific kind of learning process stories could be its units because they do have some properties. For the moment, two such merit our attention.\nFirstly, stories are a way of representing the world. Cognitively speaking, they are models of the world in a broad sense of the term. As models, they portray, stand for or represent some small part of the world. Let us briefly see how they do it.\nTake, for instance, a group performing some ritual or the other, say, a rain ritual. When asked about the significance of their actions, one gets to hear a story. Such a story depicts a set of events which includes the performing of the rain ritual in conjunction with some other events. Now it is not the case that causal efficacy is attributed to the performance of such a ritual. That is, the members of the group do not believe that their singing and chanting in some specified fashion and the pouring of ghee into the fire altar cause the rains to come. They are not justifying this belief by telling a story. What then are they doing?\nBecause stories are models of a situation, as models they are neither true nor false; it is only in models that statements come out as true or false. When the group performs such a ritual and no rains come, all that can be said about the story is that it is not a model for such a situation. If, on the other hand, we look at the way the members of the group experience the situation, then quite a lot could be explicated. When the ritual is performed and the rains do not come, the group experiences this situation as \u0026ldquo;something having gone wrong somewhere\u0026rdquo;. When the rains do come, it is experienced as \u0026ldquo;everything is as it should be\u0026rdquo;. What are these experiences signalling?\nRecollect, if you will, the suggestion I made earlier about experiencing the world as an order. The truth or falsity of the explanations about the nature of the order, I said, is irrelevant to the experience that the world is an order. There is a question embedded in that suggestion that can be answered now: In any such culture (including the Indian culture that I am talking about), at any moment of time, hypotheses float around which purport to explain the order of the universe: some or other-account of the pattern that one\u0026rsquo;s culture and the cosmos exhibit, and some explanation of the role of individual actions with respect to sustaining or disrupting that order. Many such explanations have come and gone: Why does the sense of order not follow suit?\nThis is best answered, if we ask how such cultures manage to sustain this feeling in the absence of knowledge about the pattern. What mechanisms preserve the sense of order without requiring the presence of knowledge about the order, which the culture and cosmos exhibit? One such mechanism admirably suited for the job is the stories and legends that a culture possesses.\nStories preserve patterns without saying what these patterns are. They depict partial aspects of an order without specifying what the order consists of. Performing the ritual, the coming of rains, etc., is a sequence of events described in a story without specifying a relation between them. The experience of \u0026ldquo;something having gone wrong somewhere\u0026rdquo; and that of \u0026ldquo;everything is as it should be\u0026rdquo; are expressions of disturbance/appropriateness accordingly as whether the story is not/is a model of the situation. Stories do not explain anything because they do not model relations (causal or otherwise) between events. In very simple terms, they just model a set of affairs.\nWhat I have so far said about the stories allows roe to propose the following idea: the \u0026lsquo;representational\u0026rsquo; aspect of stories is what makes them continuous with other \u0026lsquo;representational\u0026rsquo; products known to us like philosophy, scientific theories, etc. But, of course, there are also differences between them: whereas theories claim to explain, stories make no such claim. Theories may justify some belief that you have, stories do not. Nevertheless, stories are pedagogical instruments in so far as they have the \u0026lsquo;representational\u0026rsquo; (or cognitive) property. Therefore, I will now make a mild claim, which I hope to strengthen later on in this article, that stories embody some kind of \u0026lsquo;knowledge\u0026rsquo;. Or, slightly differently, they are units of learning.\nWhat kind of knowledge is it that these stories embody? And in which kind of a learning process are they its units? In order to begin answering this question, I need to look at the second property of the stories as well.\n3.2 Stories as exemplars\nApart from exhibiting a cognitive, property, stories possess a practical one too. By describing a way of going about the world, they are a way of going about the world. They are models in a practical sense i.e. they can be emulated. Stories are pedagogical instruments par excellence because of this additional property. But how can stories leach us to do anything? How can they be instructive, i.e. instruct us to do anything at all? How can a description of a way of going about in the world be itself a way of going about in the world?\nAs stories, they do not come with any explicit morals attached: they do not, for example, say that \u0026ldquo;the moral of this story is\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; They are not structured as manuals for practical action either: \u0026lsquo;do X in order to achieve Y\u0026rsquo;. If they can teach, then it is because of the way learning occurs in India. Consequently, the question becomes: What kind of a learning activity is required, if stories are how one learns? My answer is that it is mimetic learning. As stories, they are a set of propositions. What they depict are actions. Between these actions and those of one\u0026rsquo;s own, what obtains is a practical relation of mimesis. Only as such can stories function as instructions for actions.\nStories combine this double function: they are \u0026rsquo;theoretical\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;practical\u0026rsquo; at the same time. They are not straight forward instructions; nor are they only representational. They entertain too: but not the way the \u0026ldquo;The Little Red Riding Hood\u0026rdquo; does. Understanding and imitation fall together: to understand is to imitate and to imitate is to understand. Stories are oblique instructions disguised as representations depicting actions. One learns while one is not aware that one is learning. Mimesis is a sub-intentional learning.\nIn the previous section, I suggested that methods of teaching will teach only to the extent they dovetail with the processes of learning. Though not a controversial suggestion by itself, it must be clear what it implies: Stories can be used to teach if, and only if, the process of learning is such that its units are exemplars. Consequently, in a culture where mimetic learning is not a dominant mode, there the stories do not play the same role. They may entertain, take your fancy, capture your imagination; but instruct, they cannot. Stories, in such a culture, become a genre of literature and, mostly, remain at that level. Narration would be different from instruction.\nIf, on the other hand, narration is to become coextensive with instruction, either the narrative or the narrator must carry instructional authority. Neither the stories nor the story tellers carry this label on their sleeves. It is not even the case that stories about Gods or respected figures (say a Buddha or a Shankara) are sufficient to lend instructional authority to the narrative. That is to say, stories are not emulated because they portray action executed by either divine or human authorities. (This is both a factual statement about India and a consequence that flows from the suggestion that mimesis is a sub-intentional learning.) What, then, lends Instructional authority to the stories? This is the same as asking what makes stories into units of a learning process. I have partially answered this question already.\nBut, there is a more intriguing point lurking in the background: instructional authorities need not be coextensive with religious, moral, political or divine authorities. That is to say, learning through mimesis, looked at from the point of view of the learning subject, involves the activity of \u0026lsquo;constructing\u0026rsquo; the authority of the \u0026ldquo;other\u0026rdquo;. This must be an active process because the \u0026ldquo;other\u0026rdquo; does not carry identifying marks on its forehead. This has several interesting consequences as a result, not all of which are of equal importance to this paper. Let me, therefore, restrict myself to just identifying two.\nIf the process of going about the world involves the activity of constructing instructional authorities; and if it is the case that there is no necessity, say, that religious or political authorities, by virtue of their position, are also instructional authorities, the consequence is obvious: their ability to give form to your learning activities is very much reduced. Or, put in broad and historical terms, where mimesis obtains, there neither \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo; nor \u0026lsquo;politics\u0026rsquo; would have a dominating and decisive impact on ways of going about the world. The converse would also hold true: the \u0026lsquo;foundation\u0026rsquo; for forms of interaction between members of such a society would have to be fairly independent of both the \u0026lsquo;religious\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;political authorities\u0026rsquo;. Sociologists have often puzzled over the fact that in India, \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;commerce\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;politics\u0026rsquo; and \u0026rsquo;education\u0026rsquo; did not fuse, for any length of time, into one centralized authority. I suggest to you that the way learning process occurs in India might well begin to shed light on this issue.\nThe second point that I want to make regards the public or social process of mimesis. Both the process of learning and the knowledge that is acquired presuppose social interaction, instead of arguing for it in the abstract, let me illustrate by referring to, say, the moral domain once again. To be moral, in the West, is to follow some or other moral principle. The relation is between an individual, isolated subject and some injunction or the other. How the community in which such an individual finds himself is? Is a question of no moral significance to his moral behavior? By contrast, in a culture dominated by mimesis (like India) the relation is between individuals (be they the really existing community or the fictitious individuals portrayed in the stories). A moral individual, in other words, presupposes a moral community. Reformulated in different terms, the general point is this: Because mimetic learning has a public dimension, epistemic problems will have to refer to the community of learning subjects.\n4. Learning through exemplars: properties and consequences\nMimetic learning, to briefly summarize, is learning through exemplars. Exemplars, as unite of such a learning process, have a representational property and can be emulated. My claim is that the dominant mode of learning in India is mimetic or exemplary learning.\nThere is a kind of circularity in what is said, if you take it as a definition: mimesis is exemplary learning and exemplars are units of mimetic learning. To avoid this circularity entirely, more requires to be said both about exemplars and mimesis than I could possibly say now. However, it is possible to minimize the circularity in two, ways: Firstly, take what I have said so far not as a definition, but as an attempt at explication; secondly, by speaking a bit more about both exemplars and mimesis, I shall suggest that it is possible to understand them in relative independence. Quite apart from that, something else requires to be done: the claim that this way of learning is a dominant mode of learning in India has not yet shown to be the case. I shall try to do that as well. However, the intention is not so much to convince you of the truth of that claim as to make it appear plausible. That will be done by drawing out some consequences that follow from such a claim.\n4.1. Properties of action-knowledge\nLet me begin by exploring the properties of action-knowledge. Because I want to talk about this at a rather general level, let me take an example some or the other variant of which will be familiar to you.\nSuppose that you are a social worker, working, say, amongst immigrant children from the neighborhood. You have undertaken many activities to integrate them better into the neighborhood social life and, for the moment, you are at a loss about how to proceed further. That is, you do not know what to do next. While wrestling with the despair arising out of the desire to do something \u0026rsquo;new\u0026rsquo; and not being able to know what it is that yet should do, you meet an old friend of yours. In the process of conversation, he casually mentions about some activity that an acquaintance of his undertook in, say, an old people\u0026rsquo;s home. As soon as you hear about it, you suddenly know what your next action would be with the immigrant children. And, in all probability, your action is totally different from the activity that took place in the old people\u0026rsquo;s home. What exactly happened here?\nI would like to suggest that the activity performed at the old people\u0026rsquo;s home functioned as an exemplar for you: that is, it functioned as a generative action. This, in the first place, is what an exemplar is: it creates new, original actions. If you are willing to accept this suggestion, I should now like to elaborate further on this point.\nThere are two ways in which you could understand the statement made above. You could say that the linguistic description of the action gave you a new idea about the action that you can execute. But, there is also a second way of construing the statement, which is what I am proposing. I am not saying that the activity performed at the old people\u0026rsquo;s home gave you an idea of another action that you could perform in your situation. No. You must read me literally: that person\u0026rsquo;s action generated a new action; you are now able to perform a new action, something that you could not do before. While you may be able to describe the activity, which you intend to perform, this description/conception of the action is parasitic upon the ability to execute it. In exactly the same way someone\u0026rsquo;s idea/thought/theory can create/generate new idea/thought/theory in your head, someone\u0026rsquo;s action, as an exemplar, creates a new action. You may complain that this is spooky. Fair enough. But, I put to you, it is no more spooky than the \u0026lsquo;fact\u0026rsquo; that ideas can give birth to new ideas. Actions give birth to new and original actions in the way ideas create novel ideas.\nYou have now, in other words, acquired action-knowledge. That is, when described from your point of view, your ability to produce a new action now is what it means to speak of you having acquired action-knowledge. In this case, the exemplar happened to be a linguistic description of someone\u0026rsquo;s action. Quite obviously, it need not be so in all cases. You may see someone doing something, and that enables you to execute a new action as well. In both cases, the learning process is the same: learning through an exemplar or mimetic learning. As a consequence, it must be clear that mimesis, as a learning process, is creative and dynamic.\nConsider, now, the second property of action-knowledge. In our case, the exemplar happened to be a very specific action undertaken by, a very specific individual in a very specific context. And yet, it was able to create in you, another specific individual in a totally different context, the ability to execute an entirely different action. All exemplars are always context bound. But, they are generative in totally different contexts. Or, put even more clearly, it is precisely the context dependence of an action that makes it fertile in different contexts.\nOur general intuition regarding the nature of guidelines or decision principles is that the more general, abstract and context independent they are, the more useful and true they are. In fact, this is a demand that we make upon all knowledge-claims: a moral principle, a. legal statute is acceptable if and only if it enables you to choose and execute the right action in all/most contexts. For that to happen, a moral principle requires to be context free. However, for action-knowledge it appears to go the other way: Inter-contextual applicability is directly proportional to contextual embeddedness and inversely to context insensitivity and generality.\nConsider, now, the third property of action-knowledge. Even though you knew what it is that you wanted to achieve, the knowledge of this goal, together with the knowledge about your present state, did not help you in producing a new action. Also, your learning through the exemplar occurred when you were not aware that you were learning. Even though each of these two points enables me to argue the point independently, their conjunction gives it a greater force: your ability to execute a new action is indifferent to the presence or absence of goals. Or action-knowledge is not goal dependent.\nOne of the basic beliefs in the Western tradition is that human action is goal oriented action, and that this constitutes an intrinsic property of human actions. It I am right, just the opposite is true: intrinsically, human action is goal-less. This does not, quite obviously, prevent you from finding a goal for an action when you have action-knowledge. But mimesis, as a sub-intentional learning that involves the ability to execute actions, does not require the presence of goals. Practical activity, practical knowledge - as species of knowledge - is not intentional and it is not goal-directed.\nConsider the fourth and final property of action-knowledge. Here, I will be brief because to argue the case would require bringing in other considerations extraneous to the paper. The situation you were in was one where you did not know what to do. It is not as though you had difficulty in choosing between the alternatives that were open to you. It is not even the case, I would like to suggest, that you chose between the action that you can now execute and those action-alternatives that existed previously. Rather, acquiring the ability of executing a new action was the same as knowing what to do.\nIn slightly more general terms, what I am driving at is this. Within the western tradition, the dominant approach is to treat epistemic problems in decision-theoretic terms or as decision problems. I believe that this is not the case with respect to practical knowledge: epistemic problems regarding action-knowledge ore not decision problems, but learning problems. Problems of social interaction and social organization, under this construal, are problems of learning.\nBy saying this, I do not deny that it is possible to describe them as decision problems. (Why it is possible to do so is a theme I reflect upon in the last section.). Besides, I am aware, that social sciences are increasingly turning towards game theory and choice theories in their attempts to understand social interactions.\n4.2. Action-Knowledge and cultural specificity: some hypotheses\nLet me now turn my attention to outlining some empirical hypotheses that seem to follow if we accept the idea that mimesis is a way of learning characteristic to India. In fact I believe that it is typical of the Asian culture and not restricted to India alone. Consequently, here and there I talk of Asia and India as if these two terms are interchangeable, which they are in the context of speaking about learning processes.\nIf socialization involves mimesis and families are the primary units of socializing a human infant, the success of the socialization process depends very much on what the family exactly models. That is, an individual can be taught to \u0026ldquo;live with others\u0026rdquo; if, and only if, the family stands for or represents the significant details of the social environment. The family, in its important details, must be continuous with the moral community at large. And, I submit, it does.\nNot only this. In a peculiar way, this sheds light upon the \u0026ldquo;sternness\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;harshness\u0026rdquo; considered typical of both family life and teaching situations in India. One is being prepared for life when one is brought up as an offspring and a pupil. The parents and the teachers, between them, prepare the child to act morally when it goes out as an adult to meet the world at large. That can only be done if the child, during its maturational phases, faces a wide variety of situations and sees the way in which the \u0026lsquo;others\u0026rsquo; are going to construe its actions. Parents and teachers must, in the full sense of the word, stand for and represent the rest of the community. Consequently, one\u0026rsquo;s family is also one\u0026rsquo;s sternest and harshest critic. If one passes this test, the belief is that one can pass any other test. Hence the descriptions of an ideal father or teacher: \u0026ldquo;harder than the diamond, softer than a flower\u0026rdquo;.\nThe family as a \u0026ldquo;moral arena\u0026rdquo; as Indian culture sees it, and family as a \u0026ldquo;Heaven in a Heartless World\u0026rdquo; (as Lasch titles his book on the family) cannot be sharper. In Western families one is to experience love, one learns to be oneself. The socializing or the educative role of the family is secondary, it is derivative. Its primary task is to \u0026ldquo;protect\u0026rdquo; the child from the \u0026ldquo;cruel world out there\u0026rdquo;. If it prepares the child to face up to the cold and indifferent world, it does so by providing that \u0026ldquo;love and understanding\u0026rdquo; which gives the child the courage to \u0026ldquo;go and get\u0026rdquo; what it wants. Family is one\u0026rsquo;s only oasis in the desert of social life.\nMimesis, though not a blind imitative learning, entails a reproduction of existing actions i.e. it essentially conserves. A culture dominated by mimetic learning must, perforce, exhibit a very strong pull towards conservatism. Indian culture is essentially conservative. Tradition, the past etc., must weigh heavily on all those who are members of such a culture. Again, I submit that it does.\nThe other side of the same phenomenon is what happens when such a culture meets with that of the West. There is a partial exchange of authorities, not their disappearance. The tendency is towards an imitation of these new authorities. Whether we look at the shallow \u0026lsquo;westernization\u0026rsquo; of the youth, the clarion call of the intellectuals to follow the West, or even at the fact that the Japanese have earned the label, often used pejoratively, of being \u0026ldquo;very good imitators\u0026rdquo; - the phenomenon is the same. We imitate the West not because there is some iron law of capitalism that compels us, willy-nilly, to be like them, but because it is our way of learning.\nLearning through mimesis requires that one develops the ability to discriminate finely. One has to sort out, so to speak, situations and actions in such a way that one distinguishes between \u0026rsquo;to emulate in this situation\u0026rsquo; from \u0026rsquo;to emulate in that situation\u0026rsquo;. Not all aspects of an event or action should be emulated. In other words, one grows to be a member of such a culture by acquiring a finely tuned set of \u0026lsquo;discriminating criteria\u0026rsquo;.\nHow is this acquired? Again, the answer cannot be other than to say by mimesis. However, events and actions must loose their clarity and simplicity when multiple and often incompatible models are said to model the same situation. They must become complex and essentially ambiguous. Indeed, I claim, they do. One expression of this situation is the extraordinary productivity of Indian culture with respect to \u0026ldquo;religions\u0026rdquo;.\nIn the previous section, I pointed out that instructional authority is not coextensive with religious, moral or political authorities. Here, I will simply state some things explicitly, which were said there implicitly. Nothing about the learning process prevents that they be the same; the point is that it is not required\nThe first thing to notice is that if there exists a learning process one of whose moments requires constructing an authority, this orientation is bound to spread into or spill over into other spheres. That is, the very idea of what it means to be an authority will begin to get affected. Consequently, what it means to speak of \u0026lsquo;political authorities\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;rule of law\u0026rsquo; or even \u0026lsquo;religious authorities\u0026rsquo; in a culture like India is anything but clear. To appreciate the force of this difference, takes a look at the history of the West: each challenge to the authority (be it clerical, biblical, political or juridical) has precipitated a deep crisis in the culture. Challenges of similar nature, of which there have been many, have hardly rippled the fabric of social life in India.\nThere is a second point, about which I can afford to be briefer. Mimesis is a way of learning to live with others and go about the world. The nature of this learning process severs any intrinsic relationship between instructional authorities and political or religious authorities. If the Indian \u0026lsquo;caste system\u0026rsquo; is the \u0026lsquo;result\u0026rsquo; of such a learning process, it follows that it rests on neither \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo; nor \u0026lsquo;politics\u0026rsquo;. Not just that. It must be an organization that resists any centralization of \u0026lsquo;political\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;religious\u0026rsquo; power where the latter, by virtue of such centralization, could begin, to function as an instructional authority. (I say it \u0026lsquo;must be\u0026rsquo;, because it could not have survived for so long if it had tied itself to any one \u0026lsquo;religious\u0026rsquo; or political authority.) What its implications are, I will leave it to you to reflect about.\nConsider another implication of my suggestion. I am informed by people active in the area that some philosophers of mathematics are beginning to turn their attention to the processes of constructing a proof in order to say what it is for something to be a proof. They believe that the notion of \u0026lsquo;proof\u0026rsquo; is somehow related to, or requires ineluctable reference to, the activity of constructing a proof. Consider now another fact: Immigrant Asians in Europe and America turn out to be better in such disciplines as Mathematics and Engineering than any other ethnic minority. This difference between Asians on the one hand, and other groups (including the native white population) is statistically significant enough to engage the attention of psychologists, pedagogists, etc., and to initiate research into this question in a concentrated way. Suppose that there is some truth to the proposal made by some philosophers of mathematics. In such a case, the fact I drew your attention to appears to follow as a consequence of the notion of learning through mimesis: A culture whose dominant mode of learning develops action-knowledge in its members, \u0026lsquo;predisposes\u0026rsquo; the latter to become proficient in domains involving action-knowledge. When members of such a culture take to mathematics or engineering, the number of those who become mathematicians or engineers will have to be significantly higher when compared to members from another culture. Prima facie, it appears to me, such is the case. 7. Consider, finally, another kind of issue that emerges if we relate what is said about action- knowledge with the suggestion I made about order and learning.\nIf the \u0026lsquo;action\u0026rsquo; of action-knowledge is neither intentional nor goal directed, the problem of action could hardly be one of relation between \u0026lsquo;intending: and acting\u0026rsquo; However, if the perception of order is such that it is not possible for it to be there without underlying \u0026rsquo;laws\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;principles\u0026rsquo;, then it is obvious that action (typically human action, that is) could not be without a conception guiding it. Action becomes nothing but applied conception; practice nothing but applied theory, and technology nothing but applied science. However, this view is one culture\u0026rsquo;s way of looking at the issue. It is in this sense that I said in the introduction that action theories, when they talk about action, are not so much talking about the nature of human action as much about one culture-specific -notion.\nIn what I have said above, there is a problem that requires to be made explicit. If action (the typically human action) does not rest upon conceptions; if it is not an execution of an idea, what could be said about the results of such an action? By the same token, and extending it further, it could be asked, Could an ordered phenomenal world exist without being law-governed? The answer will have to be yes, but requiring of some qualification.\nWere we to think of the Natural world, the positive answer provided above appears quite incomprehensible. The natural world is ordered precisely because it is law governed. What would a negation of this statement amount to? Frankly speaking, I doubt whether one could put it in words at all. I do believe that the natural world is law-governed and an ordered phenomenal world without laws is simply incomprehensible. We could not survive in such a world.\nThe matter, however, takes on a different light when the \u0026lsquo;world\u0026rsquo; in question happens to be the social world. A social world is the creation of human actions, the knowledge of creating it is action-knowledge and this action is not an. execution, of conceptions. Incredibly complex forms of social organization can exist, continue to adapt and expand themselves without being governed by any \u0026rsquo;laws\u0026rsquo;. That is, there is no prima facie reason why it is not possible. Not just that. If you are willing to assent (however tentatively) to what I have said so far, it might appear that it is the nature of social organizations that they are based upon no laws or principles. A social organization is accumulated practical knowledge. To seek to understand a social organization by looking for its \u0026rsquo;laws\u0026rsquo; (or the \u0026lsquo;principles\u0026rsquo; upon which it is based) might be as absurd as the denial of the law-governed nature of the Natural world. It must be obvious where I am driving at: Indian caste system is based on no principle. This is obvious to an Indian, but quite incomprehensible to \u0026lsquo;indologists\u0026rsquo;. The way of creating a social world is different from the way of understanding a natural world.\nThese are but a few of the consequences that follow from the notion of mimetic learning. As I said in the beginning, these consequences do not \u0026lsquo;prove\u0026rsquo; my claim. But, they ought at least make my suggestion appear plausible.\nLet me summarize what I have said so far: Action-knowledge is not a knowledge about actions, but the ability to execute new actions. Action-knowledge is acquired through mimesis, which is a process of learning through exemplars. Actions generate actions - not ideas about actions - in exactly the same way ideas generate ideas. Action and action-knowledge require total contextual embedded ness and are intrinsically goal-less.\nA culture like India must now begin to appear in a different light: inundated with exemplars, it must be dominated by mimetic learning. Spheres such as morality, law, social organization, human interaction etc., belong to that of practical knowledge. Practical knowledge is cumulative perhaps to a greater degree than knowledge in the theoretical sphere. And the form of social organization, the so-called \u0026lsquo;caste system\u0026rsquo;, is one such cumulative result. And that is why; no Indian could tell you what its \u0026ldquo;principles\u0026rdquo; are. Yet, it reproduces itself because there is knowledge available - action-knowledge - to reproduce it. Its ability to \u0026lsquo;adapt\u0026rsquo; itself to changing environments is merely the ability of human beings to execute actions in different environments. Several intriguing results flow-from this (re)description of the Indian \u0026ldquo;caste system\u0026rdquo;, but exploring them is beyond the province of this paper.\n5. Knowing how, knowing that and action-knowledge: a contrast\nHow much of what I have said so far is unique to Indian (Asian) Culture? Is there no mimetic learning in the West? Or is mimesis merely a variant of a learning process that is really not culture specific? The answers to these questions are complex. In what follows, I merely try to take the first step in exploring them.\nAt first sight, it would appear that mimesis is omnipresent in the West as well. Children learn through imitation; an adult learns to eat with chopsticks or learns to dance through imitative actions; an academic imitates his more \u0026lsquo;successful\u0026rsquo; colleagues by trying to publish as many articles as he possibly can etc. The list, it seems, is quite huge.\nNot quite. Instead of arguing for the details, let me show what I take to be the case in two ways. You would be willing to accept, I suppose, the .suggestion that the moral domain is a domain of human actions. Let us, therefore, look briefly at the presence or absence of exemplars in this domain for the West. After having done this, let us see what the relationship is between action-knowledge on the one hand, and the forms of knowledge theorized about in the West on the other.\n5.1. Action-Knowledge and moral action\nIf stories about individuals have to function as exemplars, as I have said before, either the narrative or the narrator must embody instructional authority. At first sight, it would appear that such moral authorities do exist within the Western culture: some saints; perhaps the figure of Jesus Christ himself; priests; or figures like Martin Luther King or even someone like Gandhi. These people call them moral \u0026lsquo;ideals\u0026rsquo;, seem to play the same role as those played by the exemplars: one is inspired by their lives, one takes them as an ideal to emulate, one is exhorted to follow in their foot steps etc.\nOn the other hand, it is also the case in the West that moral learning i.e., acquisition of practical knowledge is conceived to consist of two steps:\n(a) making some set of moral principles one\u0026rsquo;s own; followed by (b) an attempt to apply them as, consistently as possible. The first phase alone involves what could reasonably called a learning process: in the process of maturation from childhood to adulthood, one learns these principles. Once this phase is traversed, the rest of one\u0026rsquo;s life consists of successes and failures in the application of these principles.\nThe link between these two, between the existence of instructional authorities and the notion of moral knowledge as a knowledge of principles, is quite clear: these moral ideals embody some or other set of principles. Consequently, if none of the above figures embody the moral principles that some individual happens to subscribe, these ideals cease having any instructional authority. Further, it is not even necessary that there be embodiments of moral principles at all: acceptance of moral principles is not parasitic upon the existence of ideals.\nNevertheless, let us look at those to whom such or similar figures are worth emulating. (Because, it is only with respect to these kind of people that we could speak of mimesis in the field of the ethical.) What could they emulate? Either they could follow what these moral ideals have said, or emulate what they did. To do the former is the same as accepting some principle as your own: the only difference, in this case, is that either its foundation or its legitimacy derives from the person in question. Let us look at the latter possibility. What does emulation mean here? It means a simple, mechanical and blind imitation of these ideals. Each of these ideal figures, as individuals, were born into and confronted situations and events that are totally different from that of those who want to emulate them. Not only that. As embodiments of \u0026lsquo;principles\u0026rsquo;, they are indifferent to contexts. Consequently, these \u0026lsquo;ideals\u0026rsquo; are exemplars only in this sense: either one reproduces their lives and their actions, which is impossible (not quite, think of the early Christian martyrs), or one accepts the impossibility of such a reproduction. These two possibilities are preserved in the moral talk of the West thus: One \u0026ldquo;ought\u0026rdquo; to be moral, but one never \u0026ldquo;is\u0026rdquo;, or that the \u0026ldquo;ought\u0026rdquo; is different from \u0026ldquo;is\u0026rdquo;; and that these individuals are (somehow) exceptional figures. That means to say, moral \u0026ldquo;ideals\u0026rdquo; have instructional authority only in the sense that they embody or represent the longing and desire to be moral. More, they are not. As exceptional individuals, they are other than and different from the ordinary mortals who strive to be like them (i.e. be moral persons themselves). But, they represent a goal that is worthy, but quite unreachable. If they are relevant to daily practices, it is only in a negative way: daily practices \u0026lsquo;ought\u0026rsquo; to be other than what they, in fact, are. What one does not learn from such \u0026lsquo;ideals\u0026rsquo; is how to reach that goal i.e. these ideals do not help improve daily practices.\nIf we look at the stories in India, on the other hand, they are tales about real or fictitious figures performing actions- in-contexts. Stories of kings, long lost life styles and of actions ages ago are used as though they have something to say to us in today\u0026rsquo;s world. That they do say something makes it obvious that whatever might be required, it could not be blind emulation. These stories enable you to execute the action in your situation without there being any kind of similarity between these two contexts.\nThe point of this contrast is the following: morally exemplary figures (in the West) are not exemplars in the sense in which I am using the term. An exemplar is a unit of learning and moral \u0026lsquo;ideals\u0026rsquo; of the West are never that. There is a disturbing consequence to this thought: in the field of morality, the West does not have the process of learning that I call mimesis, i.e., because there are no exemplars, there is no possibility of learning through exemplars. If moral knowledge is practical knowledge (not knowledge about \u0026lsquo;principles\u0026rsquo; that allegedly guide actions), and practical knowledge requires exemplary learning, the conclusion is as obvious as it will be unpalatable: the voluminous literature about moral activity in the West hides an abysmal poverty in moral life. Those millions of treatises, tracts and articles that exist are not expressions of the sophistication or the advance made by the West in its quest for the moral order, but expressions of unease and absence: absence of morality and the concomitant unease.\nIs this consequence true? I do not think that the issue is one of veracity or otherwise of the claim. I, for one, do not personally like descriptions of other cultures that make them out to be \u0026lsquo;immoral\u0026rsquo; or \u0026rsquo;non-moral\u0026rsquo;. There is a more substantial problem at hand: Why does the moral domain of one culture when described from within the culture of another appear \u0026lsquo;immoral\u0026rsquo; or \u0026rsquo;non-moral\u0026rsquo;? Unfortunately, I cannot take up this problem here.\nBe as it may, it is time to look at the issue of the presence of mimesis in the West from a more general point of view.\n5.2. Skill and action-knowledge\nConsider the following example, original to Ryle, about a skilled mountaineer stuck on a mountain. At a loss to negotiate the obstacle that is in front of him, he observes a monkey performing some sequence of actions. That inspires him to explore new strategies; new ways of circumventing the problem, the result of this strategizing is a successful climb.\nA Rylean would see this \u0026lsquo;improvisation\u0026rsquo; as a part of being a skilled mountaineer. Consequently, the suggestion about learning through exemplars appears assimilable within the Rylean \u0026lsquo;knowing how\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;knowing that\u0026rsquo;. That is to say, what I have called as a process of learning through exemplars may be conceptualized as a process of acquiring the skill to identify an exemplar. As a result, the notion of skill could be reintroduced at a meta-level in such a way that knowing how to identify an exemplar and knowing how to use it on the one hand, and knowing that something is an exemplar emerge as the two primary divisions within the sketch that I have provided. An added temptation or philosophical incentive for indulging in such an exercise would be that some of the counterintuitive properties may be dispensed with by pleading ignorance: because we are not quite clear how human beings acquire the various skills that they do acquire, until such time as we are clear, there is no need to postulate a new species of knowledge with queer properties.\nAction-knowledge, as an ability to produce new actions, could not possibly be a skill because any skilled action has a history of execution with respect to the organism in question. The characteristic property of action-knowledge is precisely that the action) which can be executed, is novel and original. Even though this appears a decisive argument, it could be easily met thus: what it means to speak of a skilled chess player, a skilled surgeon or a skilled driver is precisely their ability to improvise in new situations and come up with new actions. After all, skill is not an execution of drilled actions, even if some kind of drill is required to acquire some skill.\nHowever, it appears to me, that the new action that a skilled practitioner can execute arises by a combination of actions, which he had already executed. That is to say, it is like generating a new word out of an existing repertoire of words. Secondly, even more importantly, the skill that one has in combining familiar actions to produce new actions is not sufficient, in at least some circumstances, to improvise. A skilled mountaineer stuck on the mountain absently watching a monkey move from place to place is able to do something as a result of taking the actions of the monkey as an exemplar. Prior to this learning episode, there was an action that he could not generate out of the repertoire of actions he had. If he could have, he would have not been stuck in the first place. To be sure, he needed his skills in order to learn what he learned from the monkey\u0026rsquo;s movement: you and I watching the same monkey\u0026rsquo;s action would not be able to what the skilled mountaineer did. But, this is no problem: what we can learn depends to a very great extent upon what we have already learned. That one and the same kind of learning process can occur both within the framework of exercising a skilled activity and elsewhere (that does not involve an exercise of skill) suggest very strongly that learning through exemplars cannot be seen as a skill to identify and use an exemplar.\nThere is a third reason, purely linguistic in nature, that suggests that mimetic learning cannot be identified with \u0026lsquo;knowing how\u0026rsquo;. In the statement \u0026ldquo;skill to learn through exemplars\u0026rdquo;, the word \u0026lsquo;skill\u0026rsquo; can be replaced by the word \u0026rsquo;learning\u0026rsquo; without any obvious loss of meaning. This suggests that \u0026lsquo;skill\u0026rsquo; is coextensive with \u0026rsquo;learning\u0026rsquo;. However, the same substitution does not work elsewhere as far as I can see: \u0026ldquo;He is a skilled tennis player\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;He is a skilled surgeon\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;He is a skilled problem solver\u0026rdquo; etc., would lose some of their intended meaning if \u0026rsquo;learning\u0026rsquo; replaced \u0026lsquo;skill\u0026rsquo; everywhere. Consequently, we could not be using \u0026lsquo;skill\u0026rsquo; with the connotations usually attached to it, when we say \u0026ldquo;the skill to learn through exemplars\u0026rdquo;. Fourthly and finally, the \u0026lsquo;knowing how\u0026rsquo; in its normal usage picks out a cluster of actions that are related to each other. To do so with respect to \u0026rsquo;learning through exemplars\u0026rsquo;, it appears to me, would not come easily and with the same degree of familiarity.\nEven though these are some of the reasons for wanting to distinguish between a learning process that is indifferent to what is learned and a skill that is not so, none of them, as I see the situation, are decisive. With suitable modifications, it is possible to absorb action-knowledge into the relatively more familiar \u0026lsquo;knowing how\u0026rsquo;.\nWhy, you may wonder, is it important? The answer would become obvious when we look into the way action-knowledge could be absorbed into \u0026lsquo;propositional knowledge\u0026rsquo;.\n5.3. Action-knowledge and knowing that\nIs there any reason to limit the process of mimetic learning to the domain of actions and social interactions? No reason apart from an arbitrary fiat comes to my mind. Besides, if learning through exemplars is indifferent to what is learned, there is no good reason to say that it is limited to practical actions only.\nConsider a surgeon who intends to use radiation therapy on his patient in order to destroy a tumor. Though a concentrated high dose is required, to use it would be fatal to the patient. While at a loss as to what to do, he hears of an army general who conquered a fortress by sending in his army in several very small units and have them converge upon the fortress from different directions. The result of this hearing enables our surgeon to execute a new action: he now radiates the tumor away by sending in several mild doses and have them converge upon the tumor in different directions.\nThere is a reason why I choose this story: it is one of the examples used to study the role analogies and metaphors in human problem evolving processes. I do not want to go into the details of the arguments, but the claim of the cognitive scientists working in this domain is that analogies and metaphors play a role in discovering a solution in the way the story of the general inspired a possible solution to the doctor\u0026rsquo;s dilemma. In other words, what I would have called an \u0026rsquo;exemplar\u0026rsquo; is what they call an \u0026lsquo;analogy\u0026rsquo;.\nIf exemplars are nothing but \u0026lsquo;analogies\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;metaphors\u0026rsquo;, both the process of \u0026lsquo;mimetic learning\u0026rsquo; and the notion of \u0026lsquo;action-knowledge\u0026rsquo; can be dispensed with. With that also go the so-called counterintuitive consequences. We could safely suggest that the \u0026lsquo;stories\u0026rsquo;, for example, give you an idea about the action that you could perform; \u0026rsquo;learning through exemplars\u0026rsquo; is really the more familiar process of solving problems using analogies etc.\nHow can this challenge be met? Firstly, the point of analogies and metaphors, in so far as they are a part of the learning process, is this: learning is learning through examples. Examples are illustrations, or instances, of some general principle or the other. To learn through examples is to discover the general principles that are instanced. Analogies and metaphors, as a consequence, turn out to be \u0026ldquo;good\u0026rdquo; examples, i.e., they are a subset of examples. It appears to me that this exactly is what exemplars are not: they are not examples because they do not instantiate anything.\nSecondly, such a process of learning is what we call inductive learning, i.e., a process that induces general principles from a set of particular instances. The kind of knowledge gleaned is the knowledge of general \u0026rsquo;laws\u0026rsquo; and, as such, pertains to the domain of \u0026rsquo;theoretical\u0026rsquo; knowledge. However, it appears to me that one does not induce any principle while learning through mimesis. And the kind of knowledge that one acquires is an ability to perform or execute some kind of an action. It is because of this that I would like to look at action-knowledge as a distinct species of knowledge.\nNeither of the two arguments are decisive, much less convincing. It appears to me that it is possible to assimilate the notion of learning through exemplars into some or other variant of analogical problem solving.\nHowever, if such an assimilation of mimesis into either \u0026lsquo;skills\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;knowledge\u0026rsquo; were to occur, the following appears to happen: you could not shed light on, say, \u0026lsquo;caste system\u0026rsquo; (or any other fact) of a culture by speaking of either \u0026lsquo;skills\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;analogies\u0026rsquo;. In other words, the explanatory potential of the heuristic would be lost if such assimilations were to occur.\nThe problem must be obvious by now: Action-Knowledge and the idea of mimetic learning, which have some counterintuitive consequences, are proposed as culture specific modes of learning. When seen in this light, they appear to be productive because they are able to shed come light on phenomena which otherwise appear puzzling. However, as a mode of learning it appears capable of extension to areas other than practical learning. Not just that: any refusal to do so appears arbitrary. However, when this extension takes place, it merely appears as a mild variant which can be absorbed by other notions of learning. These other notions of learning, however, are unable to shed much light precisely about those phenomena which mimetic learning was able to illuminate. How should this be addressed?\n6. Comparative anthropology as a philosophical quest\nIn the first section, I suggested that the paradigms of order differ between cultures: Religion for one, Ritual for the other. There I hinted that each knows of the other paradigms of order as well: religious rituals and ritualistic religions. But a religious ritual is and is not ritual; a ritualistic religion is and is not a Religion. This division has now reproduced itself in the dominant modes of learning: mimesis is and is not inductive learning; it is and it is not a skill; it is present and is not present in the West.I am not going to plead \u0026lsquo;dialectics\u0026rsquo; in order to understand the situation. There is, I believe, a more substantial issue at stake.\nIn so far as learning is a process of creating a habitat, several kinds of activities are involved: the ability to build and sustain social interactions, the ability to think about Nature and society etc. Each cultural group, it appears to me, develops one of these kinds of activities into a dominant mode. Other kinds and ways of learning continue to exist and develop: but they do so within the dominant framework, as modified by it and in a subordinate mode. This is, of course, obvious: even if mimesis is the process of developing action-knowledge, a culture dominated by it requires theoretical knowledge. However, the mode of theoretical learning emerges within the overarching frame of practical learning. It goes the other way for another culture as well.\nConsequently, the issue of extending one mode of learning to encompass other modes is actual not because of the propensity of the theoreticians to raise it: Rather, it is an actual extension that a culture has already accomplished. That is to say, cultures have developed other modes of learning apart from the dominant mode of learning but within the latter: subordinated to it or modified by it. Formulated differently: A culturally dominant mode of learning extends and adapts itself to other areas of learning. However, as we have seen, such extensions are not productive: Mimetic learning docs not appear to tell us much about theoretical learning; theoretical knowledge has even less to say about practical knowledge. This state of affairs mirrors the historical development that has actually taken place: A culture like India that had \u0026lsquo;specialized\u0026rsquo; in developing action-knowledge did not give us the Natural sciences. By the same token, the culture that did develop the natural sciences exhibits abysmal poverty in social, practical and moral life.\nWhen we therefore ask questions about the existence of different kinds of learning in other cultures, we will have to answer in the affirmative: Yes, for example, mimesis exists in the West as well. But its relation to the dominant mode of learning in India is akin to some kind of family resemblance: these two are not the same; they are not identical learning processes. Consequently, the second answer: if mimesis refers to the way learning occurs in India and to the domains it includes, then mimesis is absent in the West. Mimesis is and is not present in the West.\nIn the first section, I linked modes of learning to the experience of order. In this paper, I speak of the Indian and Western cultures. There are, however, other cultures and civilizations: the African, the American-Indian - to mention just two. How do they experience order? What kinds of learning processes have they developed as their dominant modes of learning? To really and seriously begin asking questions about human learning, leave alone developing a theory about it, we need to have culture-specific answers to issues that we cannot even formulate properly today. Before we could say what \u0026lsquo;knowledge\u0026rsquo; is, we need to know how cultures survived, and what they have learned.\nSuch studies, undertaken by members of different cultures against the background of their cultures, have hardly started to emerge. Instead, what we do have are some \u0026lsquo;universal theories\u0026rsquo; which are neither universal much less theories - that merely legislate universal scope to one culture-specific conceptions. In the same way a religion does not become a universal religion because it calls itself \u0026ldquo;Catholic\u0026rdquo;, a dominant mode of learning does not become the way of learning simply because it is called \u0026lsquo;scientific\u0026rsquo;. To debate today whether \u0026rsquo;theoretical\u0026rsquo; knowledge is more basic than action-knowledge or whether the former is parasitic upon the latter is to indulge in a senseless struggle. However, given the kind of dominance that the West enjoys and the tragic manner in which it has acquired this dominance, the questions set by its intellectuals have become the questions of inquiry: the problem of action is the relation between \u0026lsquo;intending and acting\u0026rsquo;, between \u0026lsquo;mental states and actions\u0026rsquo; and so forth. These are not the problems of action or action-knowledge, but those that arise when you attempt to treat a dominant mode of learning as a subordinate one.\nIn this article, I have taken a very hesitant first step in executing a project that I believe is necessary. As a first step, it is unbalanced and uncoordinated. However, the tentativeness of the first step is not an indication of the weakness of the project of learning to walk; instead, it is a prelude to tread firmly. In the same way, I hope that you will not prejudge the kind of project I am pleading for by the merits (or their absence) of this paper. As we well know, experience, here as elsewhere, will bring the requisite skills.\nOriginal: http://logica.ugent.be/phlilosophica/fulltexts/40-5.pdf\n","tags":[],"title":"Comparative Anthropology and Action Sciences.

This article will not be one more interpretation of Said\u0026rsquo;s book; after all, there are many such interpretations, including Said\u0026rsquo;s own. Instead, it probes the phenomenon of \u0026lsquo;post-Orientalism\u0026rsquo;. Even here, the intention is not to map its contours either historically or conceptually. Rather, the focus is on raising the question: what next after Orientalism?\nI\nThe Study and the Kitchen\nNot of all books can it be properly said that they change our perception of the world. In a very literal sense, such a predicate does apply to Said\u0026rsquo;s Orientalism. Until that book arrived on the scene, all that one saw were pieces and fragments. After 360 and odd pages one saw – or at least one thought that one saw – patterns, structures, consistencies or a Zusammenhang where there were only blurred images and vague dissatisfactions before. One of the most interesting intellectuals on the current Indian scene captures this experience beautifully in the following imagery:\nI will long remember the day I read Orientalism. It must have been in November or December of 1980. In India this season is classically called Hemantha and assigned a slot between autumn and winter. In Calcutta, where nothing classical remains untarnished, all that this means is a few weeks of uncertain temperature when the rains have gone, the fans have been switched off and people wait expectantly to take out their sweaters and shawls. I remember the day because the house was being repainted and everything was topsy-turvy. I sat on the floor of the room in which I usually work, now emptied of its furniture, reading Edward Said whom I had never read before. I read right through the day and, after the workmen had left in the evening, well into the night. Now whenever I think of Orientalism, the image comes back to me of an empty room with a red floor and bare white walls, a familiar room suddenly made unfamiliar (Chatterjee 1992: 194).\nPartha Chatterjee\u0026rsquo;s bare room, the study with which he is intimately familiar, had suddenly become different. Not alien, not new, and I submit, not even just unfamiliar. It had become intimately unfamiliar – a strange conjoining of terms to indicate the strangeness of the experience. This intimately unfamiliar study was the India that Chatterjee and many of us saw as well.\nHowever, without the shelves and their books, the table and the chair, and that particular sofa by the window – without these – the study is not a study either. It is merely a room like any other. Not quite, because it is shorn of familiar reference points: this particular copy of Hegel\u0026rsquo;s Phenomenology; that dog-eared version of Kautsky\u0026rsquo;s The Agrarian Question; that heavily underlined, cheaply priced, Progress publishers\u0026rsquo; edition of the third volume of Capital This intimate and familiar paraphernalia – this European intellectual tradition – had transformed the bare room into the study and had us believe that we knew the latter as well (or as badly) as the proverbial back of our hands. Until that day then, when the painters arrived, one read Orientalism with the room made bare, and the realization dawned: we know India through the reference points of the Western intellectual tradition.\nIf we know India through the organization effected by the Western intellectual tradition, how would it look if organized otherwise? What if the study became either the puja room or a kitchen with-a-puja-corner?\nSaid\u0026rsquo;s book raised these kinds of thoughts in the minds of many of us. It succeeded in provoking us to look in particular directions by depicting the consistent manner in which the West had described the Orient over the centuries. The book suggested too that these descriptions enjoy stability, possess durability and have a peculiar kind of objectivity (the latter in the sense that these descriptions are not myths). The entire story, as told by Said, held out a promise as well: thinking through the issues raised by the phenomenon of Orientalism could/would lead to the coalescing of a very interesting research programme.\nThe Orientalist Discourse\nAs Said says repeatedly, \u0026lsquo;racist\u0026rsquo; \u0026lsquo;sexist\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;imperialist\u0026rsquo; vocabularies do not transform something in to an \u0026lsquo;Orientalist\u0026rsquo; discourse, any more than the use of \u0026lsquo;dichotomizing essentialism\u0026rsquo;. These are not the constituent properties of the discourse but merely its imageries. Such a discourse does not just consist of a set of stereotypical images about people from elsewhere and the value of their cultures. That Indians are lazy, dishonest, superstitious, etc., to be sure, are a part of the vocabulary. So too are the notions that Indian culture is ancient and backward, it is dominated by the caste system and such likes. Nor is the discourse a perpetuation of the romantic image of India: an ancient land with a mythical past, harbouring spiritual insights of a lofty nature, merely waiting to be discovered by modern man\u0026hellip; These and similar imageries neither are constitutive of the Orientalist discourse nor do they exhaust it.\nSaid\u0026rsquo;s characterization of Orientalism occurs almost en passant. \u0026ldquo;Orientalism\u0026hellip; is, rather than expresses, a certain will or intention to understand, in some case control, manipulate, even to incorporate, what is manifestly a different (or alternative and novel) world\u0026rdquo; (P.12). Therefore, \u0026ldquo;Orientalism is better grasped as a set of constraints upon and limitations of thought than it is simply as a positive doctrine.\u0026rdquo; (P.42, my Italics.) This means that \u0026ldquo;limited vocabulary and imagery \u0026hellip; impose themselves as a consequence\u0026rdquo; (P.60). That is to say, the limited vocabulary and imagery of the Orientalist discourse are the consequences of a set of constraints imposed upon Western thinking in its attempts to understand a world manifestly different from its own.\nIt is trivially true that all human thought is subject to constraints and limitations. Such constraining is a conditio sine qua non for human thought: it is constrained by language and by the conceptual resources available to it. That is to say, human thinking is always a particular way of thinking. It is not as though \u0026lsquo;human thought\u0026rsquo; is placed under constraints varying in time and place. Rather, it is the case that formed thinking is what human thinking is. To draw an analogy: it is not that \u0026lsquo;human language\u0026rsquo; is subject to arbitrary constraints like \u0026lsquo;English\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;French\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;Sanskrit\u0026rsquo; that varies in time and place. Only when we learn these languages do we speak human languages at all. In the same way, thinking in some particular way is what human thought is all about. For the sake of convenience, one might want to identify the notion of \u0026lsquo;some particular way\u0026rsquo; with that of constraints. However, this epistemic trivium should not be confused with that set of constraints which brings forth Orientalism. To do so is to claim that all human thought is \u0026lsquo;Orientalist\u0026rsquo; – a patently false statement if ever there was one.\nWhile Orientalist thinking is also human thinking (because it too is subject to constraints), it is not Orientalist because it is human. Orientalist thought, as a particular way of thinking, is \u0026lsquo;Orientalist\u0026rsquo; because it is a particular way of thinking. What constitutes this particular way of thinking? What kind of constraints upon and limitations of thought transform human thinking into Orientalist thinking? Said\u0026rsquo;s remarks are en passant here as well:\n(T)he Orient and the Oriental, Arab, Islamic, Indian, Chinese, or whatever, become repetitious pseudo-incarnations of some great original (Christ, Europe, the West) they were supposed to have been imitating. (P.62)\nTo the Westerner, however, the Oriental was always like some aspect of the West; to some of the German Romantics, for example, Indian religion was essentially an Oriental version of Germano-Christian pantheism. (P.67)\nThat is to say, in the Western descriptions of other cultures, the \u0026lsquo;otherness\u0026rsquo; of the latter has disappeared. Or, better still, \u0026rsquo;non-Western\u0026rsquo; cultures are seen to differ from the West only in the sense that the former are pale (or erring) imitations of the great original that the latter is. Orientalism is constrained to describe non-Western cultures not merely in terms of Western culture. It is also forced to do it in a way that effaces the differences between the two. A limited vocabulary and imagery are the consequences of this constraint. It requires noting that this formulation merely characterizes Orientalism. Nevertheless, it is sufficient to make sense of almost the entire book, and see in the latter the historical illustrations of the depth and the scope of the Orientalist discourse.\nSuch a circumscription of Orientalism, as a discourse that is constrained to describe non-Western cultures as variations or imitations of the West, is not merely of hermeneutic value. It has also heuristic potential in at least two distinct ways. On the one hand, it prevents us from being trapped into cul-de-sacs or from raising pseudo or sterile issues. On the other, it enables us to think through and identify those genuine issues and challenges, which the phenomenon of Orientalism confronts us with.\nSaid\u0026rsquo;s Musings\nOften, writers of great books fail to appreciate the true depth and breadth of what they themselves have written. Such is also the case with Said. His own thoughts on the issues raised by the phenomenon of Orientalism, predictably, take on a very disappointing hue:\n(T)he main intellectual issue raised by Orientalism (is:) Can one divide human reality, as indeed human reality seems to be genuinely divided, into clearly different cultures, histories, traditions, societies, and even races, and survive the consequences humanly? I mean to ask whether there is any way of avoiding the hostility expressed by the division.. of men into \u0026lsquo;us\u0026rsquo; (Westerners) and \u0026rsquo;they\u0026rsquo; (Orientals). When one uses categories like Oriental and Western as both the starting and end points of analysis, research, public policy\u0026hellip; the result is usually to polarize the distinction – the Oriental becomes more Oriental, the Westerner more Western – and limit the encounter between different cultures, traditions, and societies. (P.45-46)\nIf human reality is \u0026ldquo;genuinely divided into clearly different cultures, histories, traditions, societies,\u0026rdquo; surely one ought to assert that human reality is thus divided. Yet, talking about the division seems to cast doubts upon our abilities to \u0026lsquo;survive its consequences humanly.\u0026rsquo; One could, of course, lapse into a profound meditative silence and, I suppose, this is one alternative. The other, I suppose as well, is to ask silly questions like \u0026lsquo;how to survive these consequences humanly?\u0026rsquo;\nWhen Said wrote his Orientalism – the situation has not altered much since then – describing other cultures was predominantly a Western activity. The hostility that Said speaks of was engendered by these, Western descriptions. Even if they \u0026rsquo;limited the encounter\u0026rsquo; between human beings, surely this does not provide us with the evidence that \u0026rsquo;talking about\u0026rsquo; genuine divisions could have catastrophic consequences. It might be even more plausibly held that dividing the reality into \u0026lsquo;us\u0026rsquo; and \u0026rsquo;they\u0026rsquo; does not lead to violence. Whereas, the way the West has conceptualized both \u0026lsquo;us\u0026rsquo; and \u0026rsquo;they\u0026rsquo; have the tendency to do so. All that we have are the generated descriptions of cultures using the resources of but one intellectual tradition, viz., the West. No other culture in the world has come even remotely close to the West (in either depth or variety) in describing both itself and the world. Consequently, there is no possible way for us to know how alternate descriptions of the world would look like or whether they too would suffer from the same debilitating diseases. By merely looking at just one individual who is deaf, dumb, lame and blind, what predictions or pronouncements could we make about la condition humaine?\nThe point can be made even more forcefully when, towards the end of the book, Said muses about the character of his project.\nMy project has been to describe a particular system of ideas, not by any means to displace the system with a new one. In addition, I have attempted to raise a whole set of questions that are relevant in discussing the problems of human experience: how does one represent other cultures? What is another culture? Is the notion of a distinct culture (or race, or religion, or civilization) a useful one, or does it always get involved in self-congratulation (when one discusses one\u0026rsquo;s own) or hostility and aggression (when one discusses the \u0026lsquo;other\u0026rsquo;)? Do cultural, religious, and racial differences matter more than socio-economic categories, or politicohistorical ones? How do ideas acquire authority, \u0026rsquo;normality\u0026rsquo;, and even the status of \u0026rsquo;natural\u0026rsquo; truth? What is the role of the intellectual? Is he there to validate the culture and state of which he is a part? What importance must he give to an independent critical consciousness, an oppositional critical consciousness? (P.325-326)\nThese questions deserve either frivolous answers or none at all. To the question how one represents another culture, what do you think of the answer, \u0026lsquo;very carefully\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;by drawing pictures\u0026rsquo;? I am not contesting that Said\u0026rsquo;s questions are \u0026lsquo;relevant\u0026rsquo; to discussing \u0026rsquo;the problems of human experience\u0026rsquo;. However, I do contest that Orientalism raises them or that Said\u0026rsquo;s book provides an adequate basis to do so.\nThe Critics of Orientalist Discourse\nAs indicated earlier on, Said was the first to alert us to the existence of the phenomenon of Orientalism. While he was unsure whether Western \u0026lsquo;constructions\u0026rsquo; of other cultures followed the logic of Orientalist discourse, we need entertain no such doubts today. Our certitude is both factual and theoretical. The sheer size of empirical research conducted since Orientalism is sufficient to provide the factual certitude. If Orientalism is the constrained thinking of Western culture, theoretically speaking, it must be manifest in its descriptions of all cultures including the Orient.\nGiven these certitudes – we know now that Orientalism exists – what should our research do? Surely, it should answer questions like the following: why develop a critique of Orientalist discourse? What forms should such a critique take? What is its function? etc. However, most of the research conducted after Said\u0026rsquo;s book is an ad nauseam repetition of the following claims: that Orientalism exists; that \u0026lsquo;knowledge\u0026rsquo; is related to \u0026lsquo;power\u0026rsquo;; that \u0026rsquo;essentialism\u0026rsquo; is a sin; that one should not think in \u0026lsquo;dichotomies\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;binary oppositions\u0026rsquo;. In short, it is all but clear why one should provide a critique of Orientalism. Except, that is, for purposes of self-edification. As examples, take two of the very best of such efforts: Inden\u0026rsquo;s Imagining India, and Almond\u0026rsquo;s The British Discovery of Buddhism.\nInden, inspired indirectly by Said, tries to provide us with a picture of the Orientalist constructions of India. He details the \u0026lsquo;imaginative construction\u0026rsquo; of India in much the same way Said has done with respect to the Orient. Unlike Said though, Inden intends travelling further: he wants to identify the foundation on which the Orientalist\u0026rsquo;s India is erected. Such a foundation turns out to be philosophical, consisting of essentialist ontology, a metaphysic of structures, and such likes. Consequent to these, Inden tries to outline a metaphysics – drawn from Collingwood and Gramsci – that gives \u0026lsquo;agency\u0026rsquo; back to the Indians. Inden does not pause to think whether it makes any sense to ascribe some single metaphysics to all those who have written and talked about India during the last 150 years or so. Nor does he realize the flimsiness of his attempts to tie different theories to a particular philosophy. In any case, the rich, three-dimensional \u0026lsquo;Orientalism\u0026rsquo; of Said becomes a flat, two-dimensional, one-way relationship between meta and object-level discourses.\nWhile Indians are no doubt eternally grateful to have been accorded the status of agents in Inden\u0026rsquo;s brilliant book, as an Indian intellectual, I am left with nagging doubts. If Collingwood and Gramsci are required to elevate human beings into agents, what about those innumerable social theories which presuppose neither one nor the other? What is the status of human beings in Western societies and, more to the point, in social theories about the West? How could psychologists, sociologists, political scientists, historians, cognitive scientists, etc., in the West, when they theorize in their respective domains, accord \u0026lsquo;agency\u0026rsquo; to human beings without Collingwood or Gramsci? If they do it on a different basis, why can we not use the same to talk about India? Surely, on any count, the possibility of raising such legitimate questions should make one sceptical regarding stories like those told by Inden.\nAlmond\u0026rsquo;s project, by contrast, is more modest but no less disappointing. Narrated in brilliant detail, the story is about the creation of Buddhism in one culture by the efforts of another. The West imaginatively created Buddhism in the East, says Almond, without, however, willing (or wanting) to tell us what this \u0026lsquo;imaginative creation\u0026rsquo; consists of. For instance, does that mean that the status of Buddhism is that of the Unicorn struggling to get into my study? Or like that of the \u0026rsquo;electron\u0026rsquo; in theoretical physics?\nBoth Inden and Almond, like Said himself at times, are seduced by the imageries used in Orientalist discourse. The result is an inevitable identification of the imagery with the discourse. One is merely left with the feeling that \u0026rsquo;essentialism\u0026rsquo; is equivalent to the Original Sin. However, none of the writers bothers telling us either what essentialism is, what is sinful about it, or what alternative one has.\nAt least one cause for this intellectual sterility can be identified. In the process of analysing Western constructions of other cultures – in this case, India – the central idea that made Said\u0026rsquo;s book interesting is lost sight of: such constructions are created by Western culture. Consequent to this, no relation can be postulated between Orientalist descriptions and the constraints of a specific culture.\nThe Issues in Orientalist Discourse\nIn the course of generating descriptions of other cultures – whether framed in positive or negative axiological terms – Orientalism made use of a conceptual reservoir. It consisted of ideas and theories about human beings, the nature of languages, the structure of societies, the character of cultures, the nature of religion, the value of history  etc. In its turn, such a constructed discourse had its impact on the evolution of subsequent theorizing about Man and Society. In other words, Orientalist discourse did not evolve in splendid isolation but in continuous interaction with and as a part of the growth of social sciences. It is not an extraneous and alien growth on the otherwise splendid corpus of social sciences. Instead, it is an inextricable part of social-scientific discourse as the latter have evolved in order to understand human beings, their societies and cultures.\nBy saying this, I am not advancing the absurd claim that all social sciences are Orientalist in nature. They would have been that if they spoke only about non-Western cultures, which they obviously do not. What I do want to say, however, is that we must appreciate that Orientalism is not just a way of talking about \u0026rsquo;non-Western\u0026rsquo; cultures. It is also partly the way the West has tried to make sense of the social world. The way the West looks at its own culture is sustained by the way it looks at other cultures; the way it looks at them is implicated in the way it looks at itself. Its experience of the world involves these two dimensions of \u0026rsquo;the self\u0026rsquo; and \u0026rsquo;the other\u0026rsquo;. Though distinguishable from each other by virtue of the object of their discourses, one can understand neither of the two in isolation from either. This is what I am trying to get at.\nWhen looked at this way, the phenomenon of Orientalism begins to take on interesting proportions. If \u0026lsquo;Orientalism\u0026rsquo; picks out the dimension of the \u0026lsquo;other\u0026rsquo; present in the experience of Western culture, one can then begin to get grips on the reproduction of Orientalist discourse in the West. Answering the question, \u0026lsquo;why does Orientalism sustain and reproduce itself in the West?\u0026rsquo; does not require chanting mantra\u0026rsquo;s invoking deities like \u0026lsquo;Foucault\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;Gramsci\u0026rsquo;. Rather, it becomes a task for developing a theory about Western culture.\nSimilarly, the reproduction of Orientalist discourse elsewhere will need a different answer as well. Whereas the mechanisms for the reproduction of Orientalism within the West are those that constitute the Western experience of the world, the same answer – for obvious reasons – can hardly work with respect to India.\nThe Challenge of Orientalist Discourse\n\u0026lsquo;Orientalism\u0026rsquo; refers not merely to how Europe experienced the Orient, but also to the way it gave expression to that experience. In the process of doing the latter, Western culture built and elaborated conceptual frameworks using the available resources from its own culture. It is also the case that these descriptions were used to generate Europe\u0026rsquo;s description and understanding of itself. That is to say, Europe\u0026rsquo;s descriptions of other cultures have been fundamentally entwined in many untold ways with the way it has experienced the world. To understand the way Western culture has described both itself and others is to begin understanding Western culture itself. The challenge of Orientalism, thus, is a challenge to understand Western culture.\nTo appreciate this challenge better, let us pursue the issue conceptually. It is an epistemic truism to claim that all and sundry descriptions of the world are framed using the concepts of the describer. Consequently, such a description does at least two things. In the first place, it claims to provide a partial description of the world. In the second place, being framed this way and not that or another way, the description tells us something about the framer of such a description. This epistemic truism has immensely profound consequences to our subject matter. If constancy, consistency and durability are there to the West\u0026rsquo;s descriptions of itself and others, then such descriptions tell us much about the culture that has produced them.\nLet us assume that cultures other than the West exist and that they experience the world differently. In that case, to study Western descriptions of the world as the way one culture experiences it, and to generate alternate descriptions of the same world are the real and only challenges raised by the phenomenon of Orientalism. Before meeting these challenges, however, we need to understand them first. The question is: do we?\nII\nThe Nature of a Monologue\nWithout the least bit of exaggeration, it could be held that the study of societies and cultures is a project that the Western world has initiated. Over the centuries, Western intellectuals have studied both themselves and other cultures and, in this process, have developed a set of theories and methodologies to understand our human, social world. What we call \u0026lsquo;social sciences\u0026rsquo; are the result of the gigantic labour performed by brilliant and not-so-brilliant men and women from all over the world over a long period of time.\nLet us formulate a hypothetical question in order to express the problem: would the results have been the same, or even approximately similar if, say, the Asians had undertaken such a task instead of the Europeans? That is, suppose that in the imaginary world that we are talking about, it was the effort of the Asian intellectuals reflecting about themselves and European culture, as they saw them both, which eventuated in social sciences. Would the result have looked like the contemporary social sciences?\nI put to you that the most natural answer to this question is: \u0026ldquo;We do not know\u0026rdquo;. It is worthwhile reflecting on this answer. The inability to answer the question does not arise from the impossibility of answering questions about hypothetical situations. All our scientific laws describe hypothetical situations and we can say what would happen in such situations. (E.g. \u0026lsquo;If I drop a stone from the top of a building, what would happen to it? It would fall downwards \u0026hellip;\u0026rsquo; etc.)\nThe ignorance in our case has to do with the specific kind of hypothetical situation the question picks out, and with the feeling that there is no way to check the veracity of the answers given. That is, because we have no model of such an attempt, we have no way of deciding how to go about answering the question. Worse still, because we have no models where the answers can come out true or false, we feel that all answers to this question are meaningless and, therefore, that the question itself is meaningless. The question has not violated any syntactic or semantic rule; it has not committed any category mistake; yet, we do not know how to make sense of this question.\nThere is a peculiar air about this state of affairs. We are not able to make sense of a question, which asks us, literally, how we appear to ourselves and how the West appears to us. Yet, we have been studying both the West and ourselves for quite sometime now.\nWestern culture, with background assumptions peculiar to it, \u0026lsquo;problematised\u0026rsquo; some phenomenon, which has taken the status of a fact to us. We prattle on endlessly about the problem of \u0026lsquo;underdevelopment\u0026rsquo;; the \u0026lsquo;question of human rights in Asia\u0026rsquo;; \u0026rsquo;the amorphous nature of Hinduism\u0026rsquo; and, in the same breath, about \u0026lsquo;Hindu fundamentalism\u0026rsquo;; \u0026rsquo;the problem of modernity and nationhood\u0026rsquo;; \u0026rsquo;the women\u0026rsquo;s question in India\u0026rsquo;; etc. The same is also true for our perspectives on the West.\nSurely, but surely, there is a problem here. If our culture differs from that of the West and if, perforce, our background theories and assumptions are other than those of the West, we could not possibly either formulate questions or assign weights to them, both about us and the West, in exactly the same way the West does. Yet, we do – invariably and as a matter of fact. How could we make sense of questions routinely copied from Western social research and go on to answer them by means of empirical studies? We do – we act as though these questions do make sense to us.\nWe know the West the way the West looks at itself. We study the East the way the West studies the East. We look at the world the way the West looks at it. We do not even know whether the world would look different, if we looked at it our way. Today, we are not even in a position to make sense of the above statement. When Asian anthropologists, psychologists or sociologists, do their anthropology, psychology or sociology – the West is really talking to itself.\nThe Consequences of a Monologue\nSuch a monologue, however, has a number of consequences. Two are of importance to us here. The first is also the most obvious. Research into indigenous phenomena will not contribute in any fundamental way to the growth of knowledge about the object of enquiry. Instead, it will merely reproduce, in a monotonous manner at that, claims made elsewhere even if they are spiced with local details. The second of these consequences pertain to the perpetuation of Orientalism itself. One does not have to use either the well-known imagery or the familiar vocabularies – both of which are limited – in order to reproduce Orientalism. As must be obvious by now, the same job can also be done by reproducing those theories that have given expression to the Western experience of the world.\nA topical candidate to illustrate these consequences is the discussion about \u0026lsquo;secularism\u0026rsquo; in India. Because this debate really deserves a book-length treatment in its own right, I shall not go deep into the issue but will merely touch upon it.\nIn any debate about secularism, two kinds of problems are involved. The first has to do with the relation between any two (or more) religions; the second, about the relation between these religious groups. The relation between religions is a theological issue: each religion characterises itself explicitly and thus specifies what its relation to its predecessors (and competitors) is. This theological stance generates a civic issue: how could groups that belong to several religions cohabit the interstices of the same society?\nIn order to keep the discussion manageable, let us stick to the classical text book story about civic tolerance. It tells us that explicit theorizing about tolerance emerged first in the Christian West, subsequent to the schismatic developments in Christianity. That is to say, Reformation forced the issue of civic tolerance on the agenda. The idea of \u0026lsquo;civic practices\u0026rsquo;, viz., those practices which were neutral or indifferent with respect to religious ones, began to merge with the idea of \u0026lsquo;secular practices\u0026rsquo;. It must be remembered, however, that the notion of secular is the contrast set of the concept of the sacred. That is, the \u0026lsquo;secular\u0026rsquo; as that which does not belong to the domain of the \u0026lsquo;sacred\u0026rsquo;. Deviating from the standard text book story, it can be shown (Balagangadhara 1994) that the emergence of such a secular world in the Christian West did not mean detaching the former from the latter. Instead, the secular world remained within the religious world and what emerged was a secularized religious world. That is to say, it was a religious world in a secular outfit.\nConsequent to this, the European societies torn internally by the religious wars faced the following question: how could different Christian groups live together within the ambit of the Christian West? The parameters of the problem also contain the seeds of the solution. Within the ambit of a secularized religious world, different religious groups could continue to coexist. This secularized religious world was thus charged with the task of enforcing peace among the necessarily intolerant religious groups.\nHistorically speaking, it is the case that the notion of tolerance makes sense only within the larger framework of intolerance. That is to say, \u0026rsquo;tolerance\u0026rsquo; is conceptually parasitic upon the notion of intolerance – even if the prima facie linguistic form appears to suggest otherwise. Especially in this context, the notion of tolerance can only be explicated in terms of \u0026lsquo;abstaining from actions that express intolerance\u0026rsquo;. In Europe, the notion of intolerance made sense both conceptually and factually: people broke into each other\u0026rsquo;s churches, defaced them, beat up the preacher and the congregation of the faithful,  etc. This idea of civic tolerance did not – does not – mean that the Protestant ceased to think that the Pope was the anti-Christ; or the Catholic thought that the Protestant was not a heretic. To this day, they continue to think so. A similar point holds elsewhere too, if we broaden the range of the discussion a bit more. A Jew cannot claim that Jesus is the Christ and continue to remain a Jew. Nor could a Muslim say that doing Puja to Ganesha is the same as worshipping Allah and continue to be a Muslim. This is the reason why the notion of civic tolerance made (and makes) sense. Needless to say, this intolerance is predicated at the level of the individual believer.\nWhat do \u0026rsquo;tolerance\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;intolerance\u0026rsquo; either mean or signify in Indian culture? At least in the several Indian languages I know, translation is not possible. Words like \u0026lsquo;patience\u0026rsquo; (as it is contrasted with the notion of \u0026lsquo;impatience\u0026rsquo;), and \u0026lsquo;acceptance\u0026rsquo; (in the sense of a \u0026lsquo;resigned acceptance\u0026rsquo; as contrasted to \u0026lsquo;protest\u0026rsquo;) are used to translate the notions of tolerance and intolerance. In and of itself, this linguistic fact need not mean much.\nHowever, try telling a \u0026rsquo;non-Muslim\u0026rsquo;, \u0026rsquo;non-Christian\u0026rsquo; Indian (i.e. a \u0026lsquo;Hindu\u0026rsquo;) that he ought to tolerate his neighbour going to some temple X, doing puja to some Y, and celebrating some other festival Z. Not only will he stare uncomprehendingly at you but will also probably feel that you ought to be certified. If he is a bit talkative, this is what he will tell you: it is absolutely none of his business what his neighbour does; it does not and it never did interest him; it does not in the least matter to him what his neighbour does or does not; and that, in all honesty, he does not really care \u0026hellip; These are not some deep anthropological facts. They are the day-to-day trivia of every \u0026lsquo;Hindu\u0026rsquo;, if not of every Indian. Nevertheless, for a discussion of \u0026rsquo;tolerance\u0026rsquo; in the Indian context, they are relevant and salient. Why is it that the Indian intellectuals remain silent about such facts, while pontificating endlessly about the virtues of tolerance?\nTolerance is a civic virtue in a secularized religious culture like the West. In India too, like in most places, different peoples and practices coexist. However, they are premised not on tolerance but on indifference. (The contrast notion here is that of interference.) Neither religious intolerance nor civic tolerance makes sense in Indian culture. Examples of intermittent persecutions of groups belonging to different traditions – there must be many such – do not illustrate religious intolerance in India. If one insists they do, these examples merely illustrate one\u0026rsquo;s own ignorance regarding whether and why religions of intolerant of each other.\nBe it as that may, because the \u0026lsquo;pro-secularist\u0026rsquo; discourse is unable to shed any light on the so-called \u0026lsquo;Hindu-Muslim\u0026rsquo; strife, it takes the form of a moralizing sermon. The narrated empirical details of the dispute, about the original site of Rama\u0026rsquo;s temple and the demolition of Babra Masjid, merely add local colour and indigenous flavour to the sad tale enacted many-a-time in Europe: religious intolerance. A \u0026lsquo;secularist\u0026rsquo; account that tells us this is just about as illuminating as an explanation of the totality of human history in terms of greed. While such a story might make a fine object for theological reflection, it does not carry us far. One might write interesting theological tracts about the nature and structure of human greed. Others might use them to preach third-rate moralizing sermons. Neither makes us understand human history.\nThe Reproduction of Orientalism\nAs indicated earlier on, the Western description of the Orient and its self-description are like two faces of the same coin. The constraint imposed upon the way the West experiences other cultures has partly to do with what Western culture thinks of itself. What it thinks of itself, in its turn, is also parasitic upon what it thinks of other cultures. In other words, it looks as though two sets of constraints are operative here. One set of constraints, namely its self-image, constrains what the West says of other cultures. The second set of constraints, namely what it thinks of the others, appears to constrain how it views itself.\nWhat, however, is the \u0026lsquo;self-image\u0026rsquo; of the West? Culled from the Orientalist writings, there is a prepared answer, as outlined from Said through Inden: the West thinks that it is a scientific, entrepreneurial, rational culture contrasted with which stand the Western conceptions of the Orient. If one is satisfied by this answer, one has succumbed to the seductive power of the imageries. Should this be the case, there are but two avenues of research open. One is to locate the causes for the emergence and sustenance of these images. Depending upon one\u0026rsquo;s philosophical proclivities, one could identify the causes in some ontology or metaphysics; or in imperialism; or in the mantra \u0026lsquo;knowledge is related to power\u0026rsquo;, or whatever. The second avenue plays on the fact that these self-images privilege the West above other cultures and that all cultures are prone to self-edification. One could then begin on the endless journey of pseudo-philosophical despair about the nature and notion of representation, etc. Clearly, this situation signals us that something is wrong with the question that traps intelligent minds in cul-de-sacs.\nLet us, therefore, step backwards a bit. Since Said, we know that the Western representations of other cultures have taken specific forms: Orientalism is an academic domain, a set of institutional structures, a discourse, etc. That is to say, one is able to answer questions about the forms taken by the Western conceptions of other cultures. Surely, the next logical step would be to formulate a similar question regarding the \u0026lsquo;self-image\u0026rsquo; of the West as well. What form has the \u0026lsquo;self-image\u0026rsquo; of the West taken? Enough has been said during the course of this article to enable a sharp, short answer: social sciences.\nWe are now able to identify the two constraints more precisely. Social sciences constrain Orientalist discourse; Orientalism constrains the social sciences. We need to see whether this formulation is able to make sense of what has been said so far. Before doing that, however, let us notice its implication with respect to the reproduction of Orientalism.\nIf Orientalism is thinking under a particular set of constraints and if this set is the set called \u0026rsquo;the social sciences\u0026rsquo;, then it follows that to use the latter is to reproduce Orientalism. When Indian intellectuals use the existing theories about religion and its history, for example, to analyse the \u0026lsquo;Hindu-Muslim\u0026rsquo; or the \u0026lsquo;Hindu-Sikh\u0026rsquo; strife then they are reproducing – both directly and indirectly – what the West has been saying all along. Directly, in the sense that the \u0026lsquo;secularist\u0026rsquo; discourse about either of the two issues can hardly be distinguished – whether in terms of the content or the vocabulary – from the Orientalist writings of the 19th and 20th centuries. Instead of talking about \u0026lsquo;Indians\u0026rsquo; or \u0026rsquo;the Hindus\u0026rsquo;, one talks about the BJP or \u0026rsquo;the Hindu fundamentalists\u0026rsquo;. The criticisms of most \u0026lsquo;progressive\u0026rsquo; thinkers or of the \u0026lsquo;Dalit\u0026rsquo; intellectuals against \u0026lsquo;Brahmanism\u0026rsquo; or against \u0026rsquo;the evils of the caste system\u0026rsquo; are no different from those of the erstwhile Colonial Masters of a century or two ago.\nIt is also an indirect reproduction of Orientalism in the sense that its constraints are reproduced when we \u0026lsquo;study\u0026rsquo; Indian culture using the self-image of the West. To the extent that the most interesting writings in India today are also criticisms of Orientalism, to that extent, Orientalism is reproduced in the name of a critique of Orientalism. It is of complete irrelevance whether one uses the language of a Marx, a Weber, or a Max Müller to do so. Of equal irrelevance is the fact that one borrows the vocabulary from a Derrida or from the \u0026lsquo;post-modern\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;post-colonial\u0026rsquo; writers in Amsterdam or California instead. In both cases, the result is just about the same: uninteresting trivia, as far as the growth of human knowledge is concerned, but pernicious in effect as far as the Indian intellectuals are concerned.\nThis tirade can be justified if and only if the identification of the \u0026lsquo;Western self image\u0026rsquo; with the \u0026lsquo;social sciences\u0026rsquo; can be made sensible. Further, there is also the claim that the social sciences force Orientalism into effacing the differences between cultures. This too has to be made sense of. As though this is not enough, one has to make sense of what, in that case, anthropology is all about. Is it possible to make sense of these, and many more, assertions?\nIII\nIt is my conviction that the answer to the above question is in the positive: yes, it is possible. It is also imperative that we do so. However, assaying the possibility of the task is not the same as executing it. It is the hope that this article lends some plausibility to my conviction. As far as executing this task is concerned, well, it is a collective effort. I can do no more than invite the interested to help build the required research programme. Not ex nihilo – of course, not. Some spadework has been done, some foundation work is in progress, and some initial results are already in. In fact, these either lend plausibility to the programme or will fail to do so.\nOrientalism and the Social Sciences\nOrientalism has been characterized as a particular way of thinking. The particularity of this thinking lies not merely in the fact that understanding other cultures takes place in terms of Western culture. It is also exhibited in the way other cultures are transformed into pale imitations of the West. Let us recollect Said again:\n(T)he Orient and the Oriental, Arab, Islamic, Indian, Chinese, or whatever, become repetitious pseudo-incarnations of some great original (Christ, Europe, the West) they were supposed to have been imitating (P.62).\nBeing the \u0026ldquo;constraints upon and limitations of thought\u0026rdquo;, social sciences generate Orientalism, when the West looks at other cultures. Looked at in isolation from Orientalism, social sciences are how the West experiences itself. That is, social sciences teach us about Western culture.\nHowever, \u0026lsquo;social sciences\u0026rsquo; are many: not just in terms of domains or fields of study, but also in terms of domain-theories. How to read them as expressions of a particular type of culture? Are the changing theories, their assumptions, etc., symptomatic of the changing nature of the Western culture? Alternatively, is there also an underlying continuity (the famous \u0026rsquo;essence\u0026rsquo;) to these changes? For instance, there are as many notions and theories of \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo; and \u0026rsquo;ethics\u0026rsquo; as one could think of. From among them, which notion or theory about either of the two phenomena \u0026rsquo;expresses Western culture\u0026rsquo;? How could one justify the selection at all, without a prior theory of the Western culture?\nThese are legitimate problems, to be sure. It is, however, of great importance to note that they have arisen in the context of looking at social sciences independent of Orientalism. In fact, these problems parallel those with respect to Orientalist discourse, when we look at it as an independent, isolated discourse about \u0026lsquo;other cultures\u0026rsquo;. What we need to do, therefore, is to look at the one as providing answers to the other. In rather abstract terms, it means that Orientalism answers questions about social sciences. The former constrains the latter to ask particular kinds of questions; these, in turn, tell us about the kind of culture that asks these and not other questions.\nEven at this general level, if this claim is true, we can begin to appreciate the signal achievement of Said\u0026rsquo;s Orientalism. He has provided us with the \u0026lsquo;Archimedean point\u0026rsquo; to move the world. It can now be shown why a critique of Orientalism is required. Such a critique does not help us to ascertain our \u0026lsquo;dignity\u0026rsquo; or recover our pride, or saddle the current and future generations in the West with guilt complexes. In a true and fundamental sense, it enables us to contribute to the growth of human knowledge. For that is what we will surely be doing when, through a critique of Orientalism, we undertake to understand one particular culture\u0026rsquo;s way of understanding itself. Such a task will force us to provide alternate descriptions of the world that are richer and fuller than those we have today. If this is not a quest for knowledge, what else is?\nSocial Sciences, Orientalism and the Ethical Domain\nAs noticed above, the mutual relationship between Orientalism and the social sciences has been formulated abstractly. A relatively concrete illustration might go some way in making my claim more credible. With this in mind, I would like to touch upon the conceptualization and description of the nature of the ethical domain in India.\nMost of us are familiar with the modern Orientalist descriptions of Indian people and their morality. That Indians are dishonest, liars and cheats, is as much a part of this picture as the recognition that the British did a great service when they implanted their system of Law in India. A totally random citation, therefore, just for the sake of academic decorum:\n(C)ould I transplant my reader, to the purely native circle by which I am surrounded, and could he understand the bold and fluent hindostanee which the Hindoo soldier speaks, he would soon distinguish the sources of oriental licentiousness, and how unprincipled is the Hindoo in conduct and character.\nIn nothing is the general want of principle more evident, than in the total disregard to truth which they show; no rank or order among them can be exempted from the implication. The religious teachers set the example, and they are scrupulously followed by all classes. Perjury and fraud are as common as is a suit of law; with protestations of equal sincerity will a witness stand forth who knows the falsehood of his testimony, and he who is ignorant of what he professes to testify. No oath can secure the truth; the water of the Ganges, as they cannot wash away the filth of lying and deceit, so they cannot preserve the court of law from being the scene of gross and impious contradiction. No task is so difficult as is he who would elicit truth from the mouth of a witness. Venality and corruption are universal; they are remarkable, too, for their ingratitude. (Massie, Vol. 1, 1840: 466-467.)\nIf Orientalist discourse transformed Indian Culture into an immoral one, what are we to make of a \u0026lsquo;scientific\u0026rsquo; discourse that transforms Indians into moral cretins? For that is the result of Shweder\u0026rsquo;s research (Shweder, et.al., 1987), where he tries to relate culture to moral development. In the course of conducting a cross-cultural research into the growth of moral awareness, Shweder and his co-workers developed a questionnaire supposed to test the presence of several moral notions among their subjects. The contrasting cultures are the Indian and the American; the interviewees are both children and adults. From the list of the cases that Shweder uses, here are the first five – in order of perceived \u0026lsquo;seriousness of breach\u0026rsquo;, as judged by Hindu Brahman eight-year-olds:\nThe day after his father\u0026rsquo;s death, the eldest son had a haircut and ate chicken.\nOne of your family members eats beef regularly.\nOne of your family members eats a dog regularly for dinner.\nA widow in your community eats fish two or three times a week.\nSix months after the death of her husband, the widow wore jewellery and bright-colored clothes (Ibid. P.40).\nIt is important to note that, in India, while there was a consensus between the children and the adults regarding the first two cases (P.63), there was no consensus only among children regarding the last three cases.\nWhat are we to make of this kind of research? Firstly, it appears to me that the garnered facts cannot be disputed regarding their veracity. It is almost certain that the Indian informants would consider the above cases as \u0026lsquo;paap\u0026rsquo; or even as a great \u0026lsquo;paap\u0026rsquo;. Secondly, it is equally probable that this concept has been translated as \u0026lsquo;sin\u0026rsquo; by Shweder and his co-workers. Thirdly, consequently, sins have been interpreted as violations of ethical norms.\nNone of these might appear problematic in of themselves, until one reads through the rest of the cases. Keeping in mind that they are ordered in terms of the \u0026lsquo;perceived seriousness of the breach\u0026rsquo;, we further come across (ibid., P.40):\nAfter defecation (making a bowel movement) a woman did not change her clothes before cooking.\nIn a family, a twenty-five-year-old son addresses his father by his first name.\nand, as the fifteenth,\nA poor man went to the hospital after being seriously hurt in an accident. At the hospital they refused to treat him because he could not afford to pay. Surely, now is the time to pause and take stock of the situation. Consider the first case again: \u0026ldquo;The day after his father\u0026rsquo;s death, the eldest son had a haircut and ate chicken.\u0026rdquo; This \u0026lsquo;moral transgression\u0026rsquo; consists of two actions: eating chicken and having one\u0026rsquo;s hair cut. It is a matter of certainty again that the same informants would not think unanimously and unconditionally that eating chicken is a \u0026lsquo;moral violation\u0026rsquo;. Certainly, none would say that going to the barber is a \u0026lsquo;sin\u0026rsquo; either. It now follows (as a matter of logic) that the conjunction of these two actions cannot be a \u0026lsquo;moral transgression\u0026rsquo; either. It could be the case, a very improbable one, that Indians cannot think logically and, consequently, do not appreciate logical consequences in moral matters. Should we leave this Orientalist imagery aside, then quite obviously we have a serious explanatory problem on our hands.\nThe problem gets compounded by the fact that what one would normally consider as a moral breach is ranked the fifteenth. Assume, for a moment, that such is the moral domain for the Indians. If this is the case, there would be no India to talk of. No group could survive as a culture if its members think that \u0026rsquo;eating chicken and going to a barber\u0026rsquo;, or a \u0026lsquo;widow eating fish\u0026rsquo; are more immoral than not treating a poor man for his sickness. Indians might be moral cretins; if they were that, there would be no Indian culture today.\nOne supposes that Shweder is vaguely aware of the absurdity of the situation, especially when the American children and adults do not consider \u0026rsquo;eating chicken\u0026rsquo; or the \u0026lsquo;widow wearing bright clothes\u0026rsquo; as moral transgressions. Instead of trying to figure out what has gone wrong with his research that cretinizes an entire culture, Shweder tries to figure out an \u0026ldquo;ideal\u0026rdquo; argument structure, which can provide a \u0026lsquo;reasoned defence of family life and social practice\u0026rsquo;. How does it look like? Here is how:\nThe body is a temple with a spirit dwelling in it. Therefore the sanctity of the temple must be preserved. Therefore impure things must be kept out of and away from the body (Pp. 76-77).\nBecause further commentary is superfluous, let me make my point. As I said before, the facts are almost certainly true. The problem lies not in the mere translation of the Indian \u0026lsquo;paap\u0026rsquo; into the English \u0026lsquo;sin\u0026rsquo; but elsewhere. It lies in the very notion of the ethical domain.\nOne of the essential characteristics of the Western intellectual tradition regarding ethics is the belief that this domain is constituted by moral rules. Those rules are normative, in the sense that they proscribe one action, prohibit some other action and permit a third one. \u0026lsquo;Being ethical\u0026rsquo; means that one acts according to some rule or another. In accordance with this view, ethical differences between cultures have traditionally been conceived as differences between rules for moral behaviour. What is considered moral in some culture need not be seen so in another. This factual variety, however, has not damaged the belief that it is in the nature of moral rules to be universally valid. The requirement of universalisability is a constitutive part of the Western idea of ethics (Potter and Timmons, eds. 1985).\nYet, the combination of both views – viz. (a) that the ethical domain consists of rules and (b) that rules actually differ from society to society – has led to certain problems, as it still does, especially when the description of the moral domain of a non-Western culture is at stake. They have to do with the difficulty in identifying something in Asian cultures, akin to a universalisable moral norm.\nIn order to clearly see the difficulty involved, consider the following claim: Not only is there an absence of the concept of \u0026lsquo;morality\u0026rsquo; in Asian cultures, but also the very cluster of concepts required to speak about moral issues.\nConsider as a specific example the classical Chinese language in which the early Confucians wrote. Not merely does that language contain no lexical item for \u0026lsquo;moral\u0026rsquo;, it also does not have terms corresponding to \u0026lsquo;freedom\u0026rsquo;, \u0026rsquo;liberty\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;autonomy\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;individual\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;utility\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;rationality\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;objective\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;subjective\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;choice\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;dilemma\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;duty\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;rights\u0026rsquo;, and probably most eerie of all for a moralist, classical Chinese has no lexical item corresponding to \u0026lsquo;ought\u0026rsquo; – prudential or obligatory (Rosemont Jr. 1988: 61).\nThis claim is as puzzling as it is startling: in classical Chinese it is not possible to speak of \u0026lsquo;moral duty\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;moral dilemmas\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;moral choices\u0026rsquo;. It is not even possible to formulate a rule which uses the notions of \u0026lsquo;ought\u0026rsquo; – either obligatory (\u0026ldquo;All ought to do X\u0026rdquo;) or prudential (\u0026ldquo;If one desires X then one ought to do Y\u0026rdquo;). In the Western intellectual tradition, one believes it to be the \u0026rsquo;essence\u0026rsquo; of a moral principle or norm that it is formulated using the \u0026lsquo;ought\u0026rsquo; – in either obligatory or prudential form. Without \u0026lsquo;ought\u0026rsquo;, there would be no difference in kind between factual and evaluative statements. Yet, it is impossible to do precisely that in Confucianism. The philosophical significance is immense:\nSpeakers (writers) of languages that have no terms (or concept clusters) corresponding to \u0026lsquo;moral\u0026rsquo; cannot logically have any moral principles (ibid.: 60).\nBut, rightly enough, we take Confucianism at least as an example of a moral system. What is the upshot of the above remark? Rosemont formulates the issue as follows:\nIf one grants that in contemporary western moral philosophy \u0026lsquo;morals\u0026rsquo; is intimately linked with the concept cluster elaborated above, and if none of that concept cluster can be found in the Confucian lexicon, then the Confucians not only cannot be moral philosophers, they cannot be ethical philosophers either. But this contention is absurd; by any account of the Confucians, they were clearly concerned about the human conduct, and what constituted the good life. If these are not ethical considerations, what are? (ibid.: 64).\nThe problem is not limited to classical Chinese and Confucianism alone. I have suggested (Balagangadhara 1988) that in India we are confronted with exactly the same problem. The \u0026rsquo;ethical\u0026rsquo; domain itself is constructed differently; ethical language is not a normative language.\nThe intriguing question, apart from the truth-value of these claims, is about their intelligibility. What is the structure of the moral domain if it is not defined by norms? If \u0026lsquo;following rules\u0026rsquo; is not characteristic for acting morally, how does one learn to act in a moral way? How is an ethical judgment possible without referring to norms? How are ethical disputes settled?And, above all, how is an identification of such a domain possible at all?\nSurely, these are the questions that Shweder should be asking, which he does not. The reason for this is the relation between Orientalism and the social sciences that I have alluded to. The science of ethics in the Western intellectual tradition makes it impossible to conceive the domain other than in terms of norms, duties, obligations, etc. That is to say, an Orientalist is forced or constrained to describe ethics elsewhere (in non-Western cultures, that is) except as \u0026ldquo;repetitious pseudo-incarnations of some great original (Christ, Europe, the West) they were supposed to have been imitating\u0026rdquo;. This constraint on Orientalist thinking comes from the field of ethical theorizing. However, if it is the case that such a normative domain does not exist in some non-Western cultures, what else can Orientalist discourse do except portray us as immoral?\nOn the other hand, if one would like to deny the \u0026lsquo;facts\u0026rsquo; that Orientalism has dredged up – that, for instance, Indians have no moral norms – what routes could one travel? One could suggest that \u0026lsquo;Orientalism\u0026rsquo; was prejudiced; one is more enlightened today; and that Indians are not immoral but merely moral cretins. Take your pick: moral idiocy or total immorality. These are the only two choices open to us, if we do not realize the intimate relationship between Orientalism and the Western theorizing about ethics.\nIV\nMuch more requires saying than has been said so far. Let me, however, round off – reasons of space forbid anything else. What should the Indian intellectuals be doing today, if their present should have a future? What is the future for what they are doing at present?\nI have tried to suggest that what they are doing at present has no future. There is no future to a parrot-like reproduction of Western theories – whether Marxian, Feminist, or post-Modern. There is, however, a future for their present if they think through the issues that Orientalism raises.\nThis article began with a citation from Partha Chatterjee. Let me also end on citations, both of which come from Partha\u0026rsquo;s books. The first is original to Gandhi; the second is Partha Chatterjee\u0026rsquo;s own conviction. As we read through them both, let the distance as well as the nearness between the two sink in. And then, perhaps, we could ask ourselves the question: what is the future of the present?\nFirst Gandhi:\nLet us not be obsessed with catchwords and seductive slogans imported from the West. Have we not our own distinct Eastern traditions? Are we not capable of finding our own solutions to the question of capital and labour? \u0026hellip; Let us study our Eastern institutions in that spirit of scientific inquiry and we shall evolve a truer socialism and a truer communism than the world has yet dreamed of. It is surely wrong to presume that Western socialism or communism is the last word on the question of mass poverty.(Cited in Chatterjee: 1986, P. 112.)\nNow Partha Chatterjee (1994, P.169):\nNow that there is a much greater eagerness to face up to \u0026hellip; historical material, its very richness forces us to throw up our hands and declare that it is much too complex. \u0026hellip;. (T)he feeling of unmanageable complexity is, if we care to think of it, nothing other than the result of the inadequacy of the theoretical apparatus with which we work. Those analytical instruments were fashioned primarily out of the process of understanding historical developments in Europe. When those instruments now meet with the resistance of an intractable complex material, the fault surely is not of the Indian material but of the imported instruments. If the day comes when the vast storehouse of Indian social history will become comprehensible to the scientific consciousness, we will have achieved along the way a fundamental restructuring of the edifice of European social philosophy as it exists today.\nReferences\nAlmond, Philip, C.

Neither of the two authors of this article is a \u0026lsquo;specialist\u0026rsquo; in the domain of argumentation theory. Even though we have picked up smatterings of logic, we are not professionals working on either informal or formal logic. One of us is a practicing anthropologist, while the other is oriented towards comparative anthropology. And yet, we are invited to speak to an audience comprising of people specializing in dialogue logics, argumentation theory, psychology and such like. If the invitation to present a paper is not mistake or an oversight on the part of the organizers of this colloquium, then it could only mean that there is an expectation regarding our contributions: anthropologists have something to say about rhetorics, argumentations and their norms, which is of relevance to specialists like you.\nIs this a reasonable expectation? Anthropologists, normally speaking, study and describe the habits, life-styles and beliefs of peoples and cultures. They may, if we restrict ourselves to the doubly normative theme of this gathering, describe the ways people argue in other cultures, outline some of the norms (if and where they exist) that guide discussions and so on. Specialists like you, on the other hand, cogitate about what an argumentation ought to be like, what its norms ought to be, whether the latter are defensible and many other similar questions.\nHow, then, are we expected to contribute to the colloquium? Perhaps, we could provide you with some reflections about the Tiv (which we shall do), or some facts about the way people resolve conflicts in Timbuctoo (which we shall not); or a colorful description of the curious habit of resolving disputes by bashing the opponent\u0026rsquo;s head, which the inhabitants of Ruritania seem to like so much. You may listen to all of this with mild curiosity or with scarcely disguised impatience. Either way, it does not mean much. Anthropologists appear to be at a disadvantage: we cannot hope to contribute substantially to the furthering of insights into the norms of argumentation.\nAt this point, one would expect a reasonable person to down his/her tools and take leave of this distinguished company mustering as much dignity as possible. As you will no doubt have noticed, we are not doing so.\nStubbornness apart, there is a deeper reason for not travelling that route. And that has to do with the fact that the theme of this conference reflects a set of highly culture-specific assumptions. As anthropologists we think that this set carries a mantle of universality which is rather illusory.\nWhat we would like to do, in the course of what follows, is to share with you some of our reasons for thinking so. If we succeed in persuading you to reflect about our arguments seriously, then the expectations of both the organizers and ourselves will have been fulfilled: maybe, just maybe, anthropologists can contribute substantially in normative domains after all.\n1. Norms of Argumentation: On Presuppositions\nWe would like to address ourselves to the task by first identifying some of the properties that are allegedly shared by argumentative interactions:\n(a) An argumentation takes place between two parties, whenever their avowed opinions conflict;\n(b) What makes something into an argument is the semantic relation between the utterances, and not the nature of either the speaker or the audience;\n(c) Insofar as a speaker has a specific goal, it is to persuade or convince an audience to accept a position that s/he has put forward;\n(d) This goal can be reached only if the norms and values held by both the speaker and the audience at least partially overlap.\nWhile the above four are empirical properties of argumentative interactions, in almost all theories of argumentation there is also a normative assumption at a meta-level:\n(e) It is rational to settle disputes argumentatively, and it is preferable to be rational rather than irrational. Consequently argumentative activity ought to be a norm-guided activity, where the norms are binding on all those who are participants in an argumentation.\nWhile these assumptions are common to all argumentation theories that we know of, what divides them is the answer they give to the following two overlapping questions: what ought to epistemically count as a reasonable discussion? What ought to be the norms that guide a rational argumentation?\nThe first question that we should ask is about the status of the \u0026lsquo;properties\u0026rsquo; of (a) to (d): Are they factual statements making claims about teh way people \u0026lsquo;argue\u0026rsquo;? Or are they \u0026lsquo;conceptual\u0026rsquo; conditions that lay down criteria for considering only some verbal exchanges as argumentations? The second possibility is not very interesting because these properties get built into a very stipulative definition of argumentation: An argumentative situation is, by definition, one where there exists a conflict of avowed opinions; an argumentive process is, by definition, one of advancing, defending, retracting some opinions and so forth. While such stipulative definitions surely have their place in building formal systems (e.g. Barth and Krabbe, 1982), or even in circumscribing the domain of enquiry in a particular way (e.g. van Eemeren and Grootendorst, 1982), they are not cognitively productive. We need to be able to raise the question whether interactions involving the settling of disputes, without taking recourse to \u0026lsquo;violence\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;fiat\u0026rsquo;, do exhibit the above-mentioned properties everywhere.\nTherefore, let us not waste time fighting over the definitional \u0026lsquo;problem\u0026rsquo;. We will henceforth assume that theorists of argumentation are making the more interesting claim, viz., that wherever \u0026lsquo;rational\u0026rsquo; procedures are used to settle disputes, the verbal interactions exhibit these empirical properties. In the subsequent sections, we will see whether the first two claims are true. Afterwards, we could assess the value of the normative assumptions.\n1.1 The structure of the paper\nIt is not controversial to suggest that conversational activity is intimately connected to argumentative interactions. Therefore, it would be reasonable to accept the idea that theories of conversation and theories of argumentation are closely related too. Working on the assumption that there is a close relationship between the two, we will look at some cross-cultural scenarios in the second section. We show how our theories of conversations generate implausible conclusions if asked to account for these scenarios. These conclusions, we shall argue there, arise due to culture-specific assumptions made by theories of conversation and try to explicate some of them.\nIn the third section, we suggest that arguing is a specific way of conversing and that the assumptions of theories of conversations are also the premises of argumentation theories. Consequently, the implausible conclusions encountered in the previous section hold good here, too. But in the domain of argumentation, the implausibility is less obvious than it is with respect to conversation. We will look into the reasons for this appearance by analyzing two models that inspire theories of argumentation: legal disputes and scientific discussions. We shall how both models fail us\u0026ndash;albeit in two different ways.\nIn the fourth section, we localize the reason for this failure in terms of a culture-specific approach to answering some particular issue. We shall identify the issue for what it is. This should enable us to answer the normative question regarding the rationality and superiority of argumentation by comparing it with the way other cultures solve them.\nThe next obvious task is to outline how other cultures solve them. But here, we bounce against the page-limit. Consequently, we are forced to issue a promissory note to return to this theme elsewhere. We end on an invitation to theorists of argumentation to work along with anthropologists before building their grand, \u0026lsquo;unifying\u0026rsquo; theories. Though the paper is critical in tone, it is friendly in nature. Our hope, then, is that it will be so read and understood too.\n2. Conversations and Conversational Theories\nIt is legitimate to claim that one does not need to know what a \u0026lsquo;conversation\u0026rsquo; is in order to have a conversation. Therefore, whatever else we may want to say, it would be very difficult to maintain intuitively that there is no conversation in other cultures. Equally difficult would be to hold that some cultures are inferior to others regarding their practice of conversational activity. In other words, our intuitions do not allow us to assert either a factual or a normative claim, which would either deny the existence of conversation in other cultures or suggest that members from some cultures are incompetent conversationalists. Let us see how our theories of conversations help us relate to this intuition.\n2.1 Some scenarios\n1. As a white man and foreigner, you are a teacher in an English class in China. All of a sudden, one fine day, the Chinese director of the school drops in during the afternoon and requests to speak to you. After nearly a quarter of an hour, during which time the director has praised your work and qualities sky-high, and just when you thought that he was coming to the real point of his visit\u0026ndash;he politely takes leave. You know that what he said was not \u0026lsquo;what he came to say\u0026rsquo;; nevertheless, you also realize that it has been said.\nAs a white man and foreigner, you are travelling somewhere in Asia (say, Thailand). Intending to take the public transport, you go to a bus stop and enquire a native passerby when the next bus is due. The native consults his wristwatch, assures you that you could expect it any minute and moves along. An hour and a half later, while still waiting for the same bus, you spy the same native returning from his errand. Furious, you collar him and ask him the same question. Though a bit surprised at your rage, when the native gives the same answer, you realize that you have been had: that guy had no more clue about the bus timings than you had!\nAs a white man and foreigner, you are travelling on a train in India. Seated next to you is a Brahmin, eager to strike up a conversation and impress you with his learning. Your sensibility is shocked by the poverty in India, and by the existence of \u0026lsquo;untouchability\u0026rsquo; in that culture. Outraged and incensed by the indifference that Indians show to poverty and suffering around them, you quiz this Brahmin about why he is unmoved. The Brahmin assures you with great solemnity that most of the \u0026lsquo;beggars\u0026rsquo; you have seen are really no beggars at all, but, to the contrary, rather wealthy. Many, in fact, are wealthier than either of you. In support of this fact, the Brahmin tells you a tale (an anecdote) about some beggars who turned about to be the greedy rich in disguise! Regarding the lot of those beggars who are not cheaters, he merely shrugs his shoulders and says that it is their karma. You are utterly shocked by both the flimsiness of his \u0026rsquo;explanation\u0026rsquo; and by the total lack of humanity in that Brahmin. Both of you know that the \u0026lsquo;anecdote\u0026rsquo; was a figment of his imagination.\nEach of the three scenarios is a part of our folklore: almost each traveler and tourist who has been to Asia will have some such tale to tell. Before we reflect about any of the above three, allow us to shift our glance to the North American Indians. Here is an anecdote from the fieldwork days of one of the coauthors.\nA student nurse came to the center of the Navajo reservation in a big and rather new American car. Her whole appearance radiated a \u0026ldquo;clean\u0026rdquo; upper middle class white background. On her arrival in Lukachukai, Arizona, she immediately went up to our interpreter (F.H.), urging him to address the monlingual medicine man (R.W.). She declared that she wanted to collect information from the latter about \u0026ldquo;diabetes\u0026rdquo; in the traditional medicinal lore. R.W\u0026rsquo;s reaction was as follows: he did not know anything about diabetes prior to the contact with the Whites and that he did not have time that day. \u0026ldquo;May be she should come back tomorrow\u0026rdquo;. The next day, upon her return, she was told that he did not have time for her because the \u0026ldquo;chickens have to be fed and watered\u0026rdquo;. The third day, she was told that there was no time because \u0026ldquo;the sheep have to be fed\u0026rdquo;. The Navajo, as it happens, do not feed either their sheep or chickens, let alone water them. As far as we know, she was given no information on those questions with which she approached the Navajo. 2.2 Conversational theories and their cultural assumptions\nThere will not be much of a controversy, we suppose, if we identify all three as conversations. That is to say, two or more people are involved; there was some kind of a question and answer, some exchange of information in some context or the other. We do not suppose that one needs to be knowledgeable about conversation theory in order to identify that a conversation has taken place. And yet, were we to look at some of the existing theories about what conversation is ( e.g. Grice 1975, Sperber and Wilson 1986), we are led to some nontrivial and startling conclusions: it would appear either that there has been no conversation at all or that in each of them some or other \u0026lsquo;maxim\u0026rsquo; has been violated.\nIn and of itself, this piece of knowledge is not startling. But it does become so when we take into account that these types of conversation are not exceptions but standards, and that they all are examples from non-western cultures! (The \u0026lsquo;white man and foreigner\u0026rsquo; bit is meant to help you relate to these scenarios better; perhaps, you have had some such experience yourself or you have heard it recounted by someone else. It has no other special significance in this context.)\nIn the first case, for example, the Chinese director was neither \u0026lsquo;brief\u0026rsquo; nor relevant; in the second, the native was violating the \u0026lsquo;cooperation principle\u0026rsquo; and was lying; in the third the same holds true too.\nOur theories of conversation, then, generate the conclusions that other cultures either do not know how to have a conversation or that they always violate the norms of conversation or, even more crudely put, most of the time only westerners are competent conversationalists. This is a logical possibility, to be sure; but there is something utterly implausible about such conclusions. Our conversational \u0026rsquo;theories\u0026rsquo; generate such conclusions because of some assumptions they make. Let me try and identify them.\nThe first assumption: Common to all (or nearly all) theories of conversation is the assumption that conversational relations (like, say, that of \u0026lsquo;relevance\u0026rsquo;) hold between beliefs. That is to say, the semantic relations between propositions (or whatever else you want to use in its stead) constitute the main area of inquiry. The not-so-recent \u0026lsquo;pragmatic\u0026rsquo; turn has not seen it fit to challenge this basic assumption: the attention merely shifts to the changing set of background beliefs, which impose constraints on the conversational process.\nThere is, on the other hand, a more deeply-rooted feeling that conversational activity is something that only human beings indulge in. That is, we converse with you, or somebody tries to persuade someone else, and so forth. Contemporary cognitive scientists notwithstanding, we find it humorous when someone says \u0026ldquo;I am having a deep conversation with my computer\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;I have finally convinced the computer that it ought to accept my point of view\u0026rdquo; etc. We find such statements humorous, because we feel that some kind of \u0026lsquo;category mistake\u0026rsquo; has been committed. And one of the ways of being humorous, as we know, is to commit some types of category mistakes.\nThe second assumption: That our theories of conversation do not refer to the fact that it is people who indulge in conversation, but that this fact is ineliminably present in our deep intuitions about conversational activities need not necessarily be opposed to each other. That is, the distance between the theories and our intuitions is bridged (often) by a metaphysical assumption, which is highly culture-specific: only human beings have beliefs or only they entertain propositional attitudes and such like, discussions in cognitive sciences notwithstanding.\nTaken together, these two assumptions cloak our theories of conversation with a mantle of universality, which is highly illusory. How does this come about?\nBecause our theories of conversation do not refer to human beings (who are always spatio-temporal particulars) as they are involved in a conversational activity, the feeling is that they are general theories. Beliefs appear better behaved than their embodiments, viz., human beings, and even \u0026lsquo;pragmatics\u0026rsquo; of communication becomes less shifty when conceived as the shifting set of background beliefs. Even though conversation occurs between some specific human beings, our theories suggest that it is an interaction between two species members, viz., between \u0026lsquo;partners\u0026rsquo; of a dialogical process. Even where, as in some dialogical logics, words such as \u0026lsquo;opponent\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;proponent\u0026rsquo; are used, or as in theories of rhetorics concepts like \u0026lsquo;speaker\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;audience\u0026rsquo; are taken recourse to, they mean nothing more than the fact that the content of these beliefs constitutes the functional position of the generic individual. There is very little that distinguishes one such generic individual from another: they are all embodiments of beliefs and, as such, they are partners. With respect to the property of entertaining beliefs, it is not possible to distinguish between human beings. Because embodied beliefs are individuated the way beliefs are, the promissory note (one supposes this) that conversational theorists give us is that where one has to refer to those individuals who are having the conversation (a king talking to his subjects, the journalist interviewing the prime minister, the pope speaking to a priest, a Nobel laureate talking to a green doctoral candidate etc.), it could be done by referring to the belief sets. (A proponent is someone who has a pro-attitude to belief; a \u0026lsquo;Pope\u0026rsquo; is an individuation of the belief set \u0026lsquo;Pope\u0026rsquo;, etc.)\nThe third assumption: Some activity is a conversational activity, or a reasonable discussion, if it instantiates or exhibits those properties required for it to be a conversational activity or a reasonable discussion. Insofar as a reasonable discussion is a norm guided activity, and norms qua norms are those which are universally obligatory or forbidding, to formulate a theory of argumentation (or conversation) is to build a general theory with \u0026lsquo;universal\u0026rsquo; norms. How, after all, could one defend a norm of \u0026lsquo;rationality\u0026rsquo; that is not universal?\nIn other words, even the kind of cursory and superficial glance as the one we have cast allows us to pick out at least three assumptions underlying theories of conversation:\n(a) an assumption about the nature of human beings, which says that human beings embody beliefs;\n(b) an assumption about the nature of persons, which says that humans are equal with respect to this property;\n(c) an assumption about ethics and the nature of norms, which says that norms are obligatory in nature.\nThe first allows you to \u0026lsquo;discover\u0026rsquo; relations between beliefs; the second enables you to provide a general structure of what it is to converse and the third helps you to propose and defend \u0026lsquo;maxims\u0026rsquo; or \u0026rsquo;norms\u0026rsquo; as the case may be.\nIf this caricature is even approximately true, we can raise the question now: What if there exist cultures and societies, where none of the above assumptions are true? That is, what if there are cultures and societies, which do not make this kind of a distinction between human beings and the rest of nature; to whom the \u0026lsquo;observational\u0026rsquo; term, viz., human beings turns out to be a very \u0026rsquo;theoretical\u0026rsquo; term; and who do act ethically without requiring or needing norms and values? Clearly, in such cases, our theories of conversation break down. By the same token, they cease being universal\u0026ndash;in the sense of being theories of human communication.\nWe would like to propose is that this is indeed the case: in each of the scenarios sketched above, what we see is the breakdown of our theories of conversation. In these cultures, the kind of conversation held depends on exactly who the participants are; the \u0026lsquo;relevant\u0026rsquo; answer to a question depends upon just who is asking the question and who is doing the answering; the conversational process is guided not by norms, but a learning process of executing appropriate actions.\nWe will not be arguing for any of the above points, much less provide you with overwhelming empirical data in support of them. Even though we are convinced that these assertions are true, candor requires us to warn you that our stance does not represent the consensus of the anthropological community.\n3. Conversations, arguments and cultures\nSo far, we have spoken about conversation and conversational theories. What is their relation to argumentation and argumentation theories? We would like to suggest that the latter is extension of the former. That is to say, arguing is continuous with conversing. Because we cannot see what is objectionable about this point of view, we will not defend it. But to make this stance amenable to criticisms, we need to spell out some implications*.*\nArgument, under this construal, is something like a \u0026lsquo;subset of conversation: properties of conversations are properties of arguments, too. An argument may possess more properties than a conversation; but no interaction can be an argument if it is not also a conversation at the same time. That is to say, not all conversations are arguments, but all arguments are conversations. By saying this, we believe that we are merely describing the consensus that exists in these two fields.\nIf this is true, the following is also true: all assumptions of theories of conversation are also the premises of theories of argumentation. From this it follows that if our theories of conversation lead us to say that people in other cultures do not converse \u0026lsquo;properly\u0026rsquo;, our theories of argumentation can do no better: people in other cultures do not argue \u0026lsquo;properly\u0026rsquo; either.\nIt is here that we encounter the clouding of our intuitions: the conclusion that other cultures solve disputes \u0026rsquo;less properly\u0026rsquo; (or more often a less rational way) appears less implausible. It looks as though it could be true: one is more inclined to retort with a \u0026lsquo;so what?\u0026rsquo;, and suggest that only an empirical enquiry could give lie to this answer. Even though we think that it would be wise to curb this inclination, it is more interesting for our purposes to pursue another question: Why is the implausibility less obvious in the case of argumentation than it is in the case of conversation?\nOur answer is that it is because of the \u0026lsquo;association\u0026rsquo; that most make between rational argumentation on the one hand, and institutions that arose in the West on the other. Two such are important in this regard: legal institutions and scientific institutions. Given the historical fact that the West nurtured and developed the theories of natural sciences and the institutions of law, nothing appears to be seriously amiss if one believes that both the theories about and the practice of \u0026lsquo;rational discussions\u0026rsquo; are more advanced in the western culture than elsewhere. That science appeared first in the West and that it underwent a long period of development there is a historical accident. It is equally a historical accident that legal theory and institutions based on them had their origin and growth in the West. Because of these accidents (convenient no doubt, but not providential because of that), there is a greater tendency in this culture, when compared to other cultures, to argue \u0026lsquo;rationally\u0026rsquo;. Even if one is normatively prepared to recognize that all cultures are equally worthy, it does not prevent one from suggesting that factually the West is more inclined to pursue argumentation in settling disputes than are other cultures.\nWhat is the worth of this argument? We shall not take the easy road of pointing out to the records, which have chronicled the history of the West. We will travel a different route instead. To assess this claim, we will find out the specific problems confronted by argumentation theories that take legal disputes or scientific discussions as their models. That is the task of this section, beginning with legal disputes.\n3.1 Rhetorics and others\nThe Berkeley group of anthropologists led by L. Nader (e.g. Nader and Todd, eds., 1978) has pioneered the attempts to understand the disputing processes and courts of diverse forms in other societies. In these cases one invariably gets a party which is wronged in some sense or other and a party which is litigated. Often, there is a third party which adjudicates the offence. Prima facie the relation appears to be the same as that we see in our courts. And yet the differences are of such a nature that the anthropologists are required to take recourse to generalities in order to make sense of the simple fact that there are disputing processes elsewhere too. Nader states, for example, that the growing insight of the anthropologists is that\n(d)isputes are social processes embedded in social relations. The focus of attention shifts \u0026lsquo;from the dispute itself (and the techniques for handling it) to the social processes of which the dispute is a part\u0026rsquo; (Starr \u0026amp; Yvgvesson, 1975 cited in Nader \u0026amp; Todd, 1977:16)\nNow, this is hardly an earth-shaking statement. At first sight, it is even extremely trivial. This description is \u0026rsquo;true\u0026rsquo; for any disputational process. For example, dispute in a court of law is a social process that is embedded in the social relations of a society, which \u0026lsquo;recognizes\u0026rsquo; juridical relations between its members. Any person who studies a disputing process, say marital disputes, empirically focuses on the \u0026ldquo;social process of which the dispute is a part\u0026rdquo; and not just the \u0026ldquo;dispute and the techniques for handling it\u0026rdquo; after all! Why, then, are legal anthropologists forced to embrace this trivia as a great insight whenever they study disputing processes in other cultures? There are two obvious answers to this question. The first one is simply this: they are unable to capture the disputing processes in other cultures as disputing processes, if they merely extend (in a simple or even a complex way) our notions of disputations.\nWhy? What kind of problems do they confront? In legal anthropology, there are no clear answers provided. But the issues confronted have found some articulation. Consider what Bohannan (1975) has to say (see also Nader, 1975) about the problem of studying the process of discussion in so-called \u0026rsquo;tribal law\u0026rsquo; (the Tiv). Approaching this from the point of view of characterizing the nature of legal discussion in the Tiv, he says: \u0026ldquo;But the two \u0026rsquo;languages\u0026rsquo; per se\u0026ndash;English jurisprudence, and the native language\u0026ndash;are not equivalent entities\u0026rdquo; (1975: 404). The problem, as he sees it, is that British jurisprudence is a sort of formalized language. Consequently, he speaks primarily about the \u0026lsquo;vocabulary\u0026rsquo; of the Tiv and the jurisprudence. But his problem is not simply one of presence or absence of some set of words in either of the two languages. Hence, on the same page, he says that we should think of the British jurisprudence as a whole \u0026lsquo;medium\u0026rsquo;, which is not at all similar to the Tiv tradition. A similar point is made by Nader too: what seems familiar in western and non-western traditions at first sight (disputing processes, argumentation, etc.) proves to be very different in practice. That is to say, the notion of \u0026rsquo;legal dispute\u0026rsquo; makes it almost impossible to theoretically recognize as a legal dispute, even where it is perfectly obvious that the phenomenon is a legal dispute.\nTo understand this predicament better, we need to look at the second answer to the question why the anthropologists palm off trivia as deep insights. It involves a literal reading of their answer, but against the background of what we have identified as the assumptions of conversation and argumentation theories. If we do that, we can rewrite their general point thus:\n(a) A dispute is not merely a confrontation of belief systems, but a relation between specific human beings as the socio-cultural entities that they are.\n(b) The \u0026lsquo;parties\u0026rsquo; of a disputing process are not mere partners, and a dispute cannot be reduced to a set of techniques used by them. What goes on in a dispute is a genuine change of social status, of \u0026lsquo;personhood\u0026rsquo; etc., according to the tradition one lives in.\n(c) The dispute is \u0026lsquo;relevant\u0026rsquo; to or restricted to the tradition of the disputants. Indeed, in most disputes with members of another tradition (a foreigner, enemy, etc.) a different language and other procedures are used.\nIn other words, our theories of rhetorics that take legal disputations as models fail us if used to understand disputing processes in other cultures. They do not even allow us to identify the process which we need to study in order to settle the question of the existence or otherwise of rational procedures for solving conflicts. This, then, is the problem faced by one set of theories of argumentation.\nWhat would happen if we were to take scientific discussions as our models? Could we at least make use of that to defend our normative assumption about what a reasonable discussion \u0026lsquo;ought\u0026rsquo; to be like? Some have indeed travelled this path. Let us examine their attempt now*.*\n3.2 On the irrelevance of \u0026lsquo;rhetorics\u0026rsquo;\nAll appellations such as \u0026lsquo;universal\u0026rsquo; audience notwithstanding, the models that appear to inspire the rhetoricians are those involving an \u0026lsquo;ideal\u0026rsquo; scientific community. There is, it appears, an entrance fee to be paid in order to be a partner in a rhetorical event: knowledgeability in the particular domain. This price is not only too steep for the ordinary citizen, but it also effectively excludes cogitations about almost all issues of social, political and moral significance. Because of this, theories of argumentation threaten to become irrelevant. Let us explain ourselves.\nConsider, as an example, van Eemeren and Grootendorst\u0026rsquo;s book (or, for that matter, Barth and Krabbe\u0026rsquo;s dialogical systems). It is really difficult to take the rules that they propose for \u0026lsquo;reasonable discussion\u0026rsquo; seriously: speaking in turn, discussing \u0026lsquo;critically\u0026rsquo; (dialectically) some or other thesis put across by a proponent, etc. Surely, when Blackhole physicists come together in a conference and try to \u0026rsquo;evaluate\u0026rsquo; the competing claims of theories they have a \u0026lsquo;reasonable discussion\u0026rsquo; without ever having heard of rhetoricians. How, we wonder, would physicists react when one of their colleagues puts across a hypothesis and refuses to \u0026rsquo;test\u0026rsquo; it? What would their response to a colleague be who tells them to accept some theorem as true, but refuses to prove it when asked to do so? (This is the \u0026lsquo;obligation to defend one\u0026rsquo;s position\u0026rsquo;\u0026ndash;one of the norms in argumentation theory.) By and large, it appears to us, contemporary rhetorics is irrelevant to scientific discussions. Not only because of the fact that the latter functions as a model for the former, but also because the strictures of contemporary rhetorics are far too primitive to \u0026lsquo;regulate\u0026rsquo; scientific discussions*.*\nFor the life of us, on the other hand, we cannot imagine what the demand for \u0026lsquo;critical testing\u0026rsquo; really means when issues of social and moral concern are debated. How could one \u0026lsquo;critically test\u0026rsquo; the claim that peace in Europe since the Second World War is due to the nuclear umbrella? Or, for that matter, its negation? How to \u0026lsquo;critically test\u0026rsquo; the statement that eliminating the budgetary deficit ought to be the aim of a government which intends to guarantee the welfare of its people? How to \u0026lsquo;critically test\u0026rsquo; the proposition that sanctions against South Africa are moral or that it is immoral? \u0026lsquo;Critical rationalists\u0026rsquo;, like van Eemeren and Grootendorst, do not give us any answers*.*\nSuch a theory of argumentation ends up becoming totally irrelevant: where we do argue \u0026lsquo;reasonably\u0026rsquo;, there we do not need a theory of argumentation to tell us that it \u0026lsquo;ought\u0026rsquo; to be done. Where we do not know how to reasonably \u0026lsquo;argue\u0026rsquo;, there the theory of argumentation has little to tell us!\nIt must be pretty obvious what the problem is: when scientists come together to discuss and mutually evaluate the results of their colleagues, they come equipped with a whole arsenal. They have explicit theories, localizable problems, experimental techniques, accepted notions of \u0026rsquo;experimental evidence\u0026rsquo;, and many other things we do not know much about. The theories of argumentation that take scientific discussions as their model are not built after a thorough analysis of the structure of discussions in (m)any scientific domain(s). Instead, the theorists rush into the battle-field with pitiful slogans like \u0026lsquo;falsifiability\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;anti-justificationism\u0026rsquo; and such like. The problem with issues of social, moral and political concern is that none of the above conditions hold: most of our \u0026rsquo;theories\u0026rsquo; are either implicit or fragmented; it is difficult to specify what the problem is or what counts as its solution, etc.\nThere is another way of putting this: theories that take \u0026lsquo;scientific discussions\u0026rsquo; as their model suggest that a persuasive speech merely involves transmission of information. Where it does concern only transmission of information\u0026ndash;such as reports of the results of experiments, elaboration of mini-theories and such like\u0026ndash;it does make sense to focus upon the \u0026rsquo;efficacy\u0026rsquo; of transmitting information, its brevity and relevance and such like. But as we have seen, in such situations the argumentation \u0026rsquo;theories\u0026rsquo; are irrelevant. When it is about issues of social, political and moral concerns of communities, it is hardly clear what counts as information and what does not.\nThere is no great need, we take it, to summarize more than briefly the drift of what we have argued so far: our theories of argumentation threaten to become irrelevant. They become irrelevant to studying other cultures (in one case) because we cannot even identify the phenomenon that we are supposed to study; they become irrelevant (in the other case) because they have nothing to say!\nWhat, then, are theorists of argumentation really doing when they speak of \u0026rsquo;norms in argumentation\u0026rsquo;? What are they studying? Why do they fail us, all tall claims notwithstanding? To get a grasp on this question, we need to identify the \u0026ldquo;problem situation\u0026rdquo; (as \u0026lsquo;critical rationalists\u0026rsquo; put it) of theories of argumentation. To this task, we now turn.\n4. Learning and rhetorics\nLet us begin with the following two questions: when is someone a speaker? Under what conditions is someone the audience? In order to prevent possible misunderstanding, let us say straight away that we are interested in the nature of these \u0026lsquo;roles\u0026rsquo;. That one and the same person can be both a speaker and the audience within the same argumentative interaction does not, in any way, alter the answer that one gives to the two questions.\n4.1 The speaker and his audience\nLet us begin with the speaker: in an ideal case, the speaker wants to persuade his audience that the information he is about to convey to them is \u0026rsquo;true\u0026rsquo; (or \u0026lsquo;acceptable\u0026rsquo; or whatever). He also wants to win the adherence of the audience to his position because it is a rational position. Since we are talking about (and interested in) issues of social, political and moral concern, we can reformulate the above sentences thus: In an ideal case, a speaker has chosen for a course of action, his choice is a rational one, his goal is to convey reasons for his choice and persuade (where applicable) his public to be equally rational. The audience, if we assume that the speaker has been successful, has now learnt something from the rhetor: it has acquired a new piece of information. What competence is required on the part of the audience in order to be persuaded? The only condition is that it understands the speaker. The public requires linguistic competence, and nothing else. That is to say, learning (on the part of audience) is fundamentally a passive act of absorbing information! Consequently, if the audience has to learn, it has to be passive.\nOne might want to say that the audience is \u0026lsquo;really\u0026rsquo; not passive, but active instead, because it needs to \u0026rsquo;think\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;analyze the argument\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;check for inconsistencies\u0026rsquo; and so forth. Is this indeed the case? We do not think so: insofar as no axiomatized theory about issues of political, moral and social issues exist, the inconsistencies in arguments about these issues are found out by using the logical intuitions built into the language. To be a competent speaker-in-a-language (not an infallible one), to understand a language is to understand the logical relations between the sentences. No \u0026rsquo;extra\u0026rsquo; activity apart from understanding a language is required. The same holds for \u0026rsquo;thinking\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;analyzing the argument\u0026rsquo; too. In other words, a successful speaker requires a passive audience; a passive audience is a pre-requisite for \u0026lsquo;rational\u0026rsquo; argumentation.\nThis is a curious paradox: the alleged partnership (with all its connotations of \u0026rsquo;equality\u0026rsquo; and such like) involves an undignified, asymmetrical relation. The speaker speaks, while the audience shuts up and listens. (In the hands of contemporary \u0026lsquo;critical rationalists\u0026rsquo;, it is even the norm!) If we look at a bit closely, the \u0026lsquo;paradox\u0026rsquo; vanishes: if human beings are embodied beliefs, a learning process for such beings cannot be anything other than change in their belief systems. The culture-specific assumptions that we identified earlier are continuous with this state of affairs as well.\n4.2 The field of argumentation\nLet us shift our attention sidewards to bring the (problem) situation into better focus: Consider any situation where we intuitively would like a theory of argumentation to help us: abortion, divorce situations, discrimination on grounds of race and sex, nuclear umbrellas, unemployment, AIDS\u0026hellip; Why exactly do we want to argue? Because it is not clear which action has to be executed next in that situation which called for an argument. That is to say, both the \u0026lsquo;speaker\u0026rsquo; and the \u0026lsquo;audience\u0026rsquo; are in a learning situation. The situation is new, the learnt repertoire of actions does not appear to be adequate; consequently, both the speaker and the audience have the same question to which they seek an answer together: what to do next? To this description of the situation, if you add such assumptions as:\n(a) one decides first: actions are executions of decisions;\n(b) an action is rational accordingly as whether the decision was rational or not;\n(c) a human being is rational if he decides rationally; and such like,\nthen you will arrive at the more familiar picture of a person unable to decide which course of action to choose. To provide help in such contexts is to provide as much and as accurate information as possible. A \u0026lsquo;good\u0026rsquo; speaker does precisely that.\nIn other words, the issue that argumentation tries to solve is one of providing a set of learning strategies. It is telling us how to go about solving a problem of learning to execute new actions. Its heuristic (even if the theorists call them \u0026rsquo;norms\u0026rsquo;) for learning is that we should try and acquire information by listening.\nBut, of course, this is not what argumentation theorists say: they say that the domain of rhetorics is about resolution of the conflict of avowed opinions. We would like to suggest that this \u0026lsquo;self-description\u0026rsquo; of contemporary rhetorics is a false one, if it is taken to mean that both the domain and the problem exist quite independent of a highly culture-laden way of conceptualizing the domain itself. It is taken to mean this, because each writer informs his readers that \u0026ldquo;wherever there are people, there are differences of opinion\u0026rdquo; and so forth. Let us look at this point more closely.\nConsider the following example: In order to say that Aristotelian physics is less preferable to Galilean physics, we need to identify the question which they were both trying to solve, viz ., Why do unsupported bodies fall downwards? It will not do to say that Aristotelian physics was solving only the problems of the existence of entelechy or energia. Rather, with these and other related notions, Aristotelian physics tried to solve, say, the problem of the motion of bodies. To be sure, it also formulated questions and answers that cannot even be conceptualized in Galilean physics: the relation between actuality and potentiality, for example. But when these two theories in physics emerged as rivals, and a choice was made between them, one had to (at the least) identify a set of common problems that both tried to solve. Analogously, the problem which argumentation theories answer is one of \u0026lsquo;How to learn what to do next?\u0026rsquo; The problem \u0026lsquo;How to solve conflicts of opinions?\u0026rsquo; is a problem within argumentation theory in exactly the same way the question \u0026lsquo;How does potentiality relate to actuality?\u0026rsquo; was a problem in Aristotelian physics. In order to assess the worth of argumentation theories by comparing them with rival theories, their internal questions are of little use.\nWe could also reformulate this point differently. One could and should draw a distinction between (i) a field of study, and (ii) a particular approach or a collection of approaches typically used in that field of study. To say, as contemporary argumentation theorists do, that they study the field of argumentation is, we claim, wrong. The field of study is one of finding out how to execute an action when the next action is not obvious. That is, it is a field of action-heuristic. The characteristic property of contemporary argumentation theories is that they solve this problem by suggesting that we have differences of opinion and that we try to resolve it. This is but one answer, but one way of conceptualizing the solution. If this is the case, what happens to the normative position underlying the existing argumentation theories?\n4.3 Why is it rational to argue?\nOne of the most simplistic answers to this question, unfortunately the only one that seems to exist in the literature, is the one that Popper has popularized. It appears as though Humankind knows of two things: either \u0026lsquo;argue\u0026rsquo; peacefully or chop off the heads of those who disagree. As he put it once,\nIf the method of rational critical discussion should establish itself, then this should make use of violence obsolete: critical reason is the only alternative to violence so far discovered. (Popper 1972, p.292; emphasis by Popper)\nEither people die, or people let ideas die in their stead. \u0026ldquo;In the face of argument of such quality\u0026rdquo; writes Gellner\u0026ndash;a Popperian, though no neophyte\u0026ndash;\u0026ldquo;one can only feel embarrassment\u0026rdquo;. (Gellner, 1985, p.43) Not all, apparently, share Gellner\u0026rsquo;s discomfiture. Barth and Krabbe more or less endorse the \u0026lsquo;reason or violence\u0026rsquo; view of Popper (p. 25, 1982); the same motif appears to animate the work of van Eemeren and Grootendorst too.\nWe can appreciate why this alternative between \u0026lsquo;reason\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;violence\u0026rsquo; will not do. Because, to make this alternative stick, one will have to show that the way the argumentation theories look at their field of study is also the only way of \u0026lsquo;peacefully\u0026rsquo; solving it. No \u0026lsquo;critical\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;dogmatic\u0026rsquo; rationalist has shown this; nor, for that matter, can they show it. The reason is as obvious as it is deplorable: they have not studied how other cultures have solved the same problem. Not only that. Only the arrogant or the foolish would claim that their pet \u0026rsquo;theory\u0026rsquo; is the only way of solving some problem. History of sciences has taught us at least that much.\n5. A Question\nWe would have liked to outline at least one other way of solving this problem by drawing upon one of the living cultures, viz., Asia. But the page-limit that is imposed upon us makes it impossible to do so. Consequently, all that we can do in the rest of the space allotted to us is to raise some questions.\nThe premises of argumentation theory, viz., the presentation of a thesis, adducing evidence for it, addressing a \u0026lsquo;universal\u0026rsquo; audience, etc., are all culture-specific assumptions. They are not the result of considered reflections (even if they are the results of considerable efforts) on human situations. Stipulative fiats aside, we see no obvious \u0026lsquo;superiority\u0026rsquo; to these notions as they are canvassed by theorists of arguments. Practically, these proposals are next to worthless. Empirically, with respect to other cultures, they are false anyway.\nIf you are with us so far, you have been with us almost to the end. Our theories of conversation, our theories of rhetorics suggest to us that others neither know how to talk nor how to argue. Factually these claims are false, normatively they are untenable. (Nor because, we would like to emphasize, of a dubious normative premise that all cultures ought to be considered equally worthy or equally rational or whatever else.)\nThe question that we should ask ourselves, at the end of an anthropological disquisition such as this one, is this: should we not attempt to develop our \u0026lsquo;general\u0026rsquo; theories of communication after we have made some efforts to understand other cultures and other human beings on their terms? Should we not attempt to get rid of our illusions regarding the universality of what are really our provincial experiences before building theories that lay down \u0026rsquo;normative\u0026rsquo; rules as to what counts and does not count as \u0026lsquo;reasonable\u0026rsquo; discussions? As anthropologists (even if one of the coauthors does not think himself as an anthropologist!), our answers are in the positive. Whether we have able to convince you or persuade you is something that we shall know only later. It is our hope that we have at least made our claims appear plausible.\nReferences\nBarth, E.M. and E.C.W.

Here are two extremes, when it comes to saying what it is: (a) one goes very deeply into what Mudras mean, which of the mudras occur in this daily ritual; analyses the praanayaama as it is taught; goes into what the Gaayathri mantra really means; and so on. (b) The other extreme is an ordinary Brahmin who performs all the prescribed actions without knowing what any of them mean. 1.1. When asked, they both give their answers: the one tells us of the results of his research and the other simply says: \u0026ldquo;I do not know what any of these mean. I perform them because I have been taught that way.\u0026rdquo; Question: which one of these claims is TRUE? Further, unless you make a meta-assumption about the whether or not rituals ought to have a meaning, you cannot even privilege one story above the other.\n1.2. Consider a third person, who says: none of these actions mean anything. And when all three perform the ritual, is it possible to say of any one person\u0026rsquo;s performance that he is not doing sandhyaavandanam?\n1.3. The three have a debate. The third says of the first interpretation, the following: \u0026ldquo;I do not deny that you can interpret the ritual that way, or another way. But that is how you interpret it. That need not be the only true interpretation. In fact, my Guru told me the following: the truly enlightened man does all these ritual actions without ascribing any meaning to them. The enlightened man knows that he is not performing any of these actions, does it without any goal or purpose in his mind; is completely indifferent to what these actions mean or whether they mean anything at all… One can learn to become enlightened by doing the ritual the way the enlightened man does it: that is, by being totally indifferent to what these actions are, what they mean, etc. Therefore, the \u0026lsquo;real\u0026rsquo; meaning of this ritual is what it is to the enlightened man: it means nothing.\u0026rdquo; Would our traditions allow us to say that this claim is FALSE?\n1.4. We have then, three claims: the ritual is pregnant with meaning; the performer is not aware of it; the performer denies meaning. Our traditions allow us to say that each of these claims is TRUE. (Here is one way of how one would make all three claims come out true: the ritual is meaningless to the enlightened; since not everyone is enlightened, one needs to know what they mean; but because not everyone can find out all these meanings, one can continue to do perform the ritual even if one does not know what it means … That is the \u0026rsquo;truth\u0026rsquo; of the claim is \u0026lsquo;relativized\u0026rsquo; to the person performing the ritual.)\n1.5. Logically speaking, we have the following situation: something has meaning (true); there is no awareness of any meaning; the same thing has no meaning (true). Yet all three perform the same thing. The logical conclusion? That thing is indifferent to meaning-ascription. The \u0026rsquo;truth value\u0026rsquo; of the ritual does not change as the \u0026lsquo;meaning\u0026rsquo; of that ritual changes.\n1.6. At the first level of abstraction, this is what it means to say that rituals are meaningless: one can provide multiple meanings; one need not know any meanings; one can deny all meanings. And yet,one can perform and be seen as performing the same ritual. (Consider the chanting of mantras, for instance.) In some senses, our (Indian) common-sense preserves this insight thus: mantras and rituals are provided with efficacy, whether the performer is aware or ignorant of the \u0026lsquo;meaning\u0026rsquo; of these rituals and mantras. This insight does not mean that rituals or mantras have some magical potency (though this is how common-sense puts it), but that they are indifferent to meanings. They just work (says our common-sense) because they are rituals and mantras.\nConsider the Catholic mass (assuming, for a moment, that it too is a ritual) as an example. There are rigid limits to interpretation. You might or might not believe that \u0026rsquo;transubstantiation\u0026rsquo; really occurs, where the bread becomes Christ\u0026rsquo;s body and the wine his blood. In fact, you can even be agnostic about this doctrine. But the limits of what they \u0026lsquo;mean\u0026rsquo; are prescribed by the Catholic theology. You are not eating the \u0026rsquo;naiveedyam\u0026rsquo; you prepared in your kitchen, or the bread you bought at the baker\u0026rsquo;s shop. Nor are you celebrating Ganesha Chathurthi. Some variation is allowed in interpretation of the \u0026lsquo;meaning\u0026rsquo; of the Catholic Mass; but the variations are circumscribed in such a way that of each interpretation it can be said unambiguously that it either \u0026rsquo;true\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;false\u0026rsquo;. I do not, for instance, consider the Catholic Mass as a ritual; it is a liturgical event.\nX says that it is his gut-level feeling that rituals are not meaningless. My riposte is this: it is not his gut-level feeling at all; but his westernized consciousness that speaks here. This consciousness makes meta-level assumptions about human actions, what it means to speak of their meaning, and the kind of beings humans become when they perform meaningless actions.\nOf course, we need to develop a good theory of rituals. That is a task for the future. But there is nothing silly or stupid about the claim that providing symbolic (or other) interpretations of rituals are typical of the western culture because it does not know of rituals. A flag-hoisting ceremony is not a ritual, any more than scratching your skin because it itches is a rite.\n","tags":[],"title":"Rituals and their meaninglessness—S.N.Balagangadhara","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/rituals-and-their-meaninglessness-s-n-balagangadhara/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","colonial consciousness"],"content":"It is an event because the colonial consciousness that I am talking about comprises of multiplicity of actions executed by indefinitely many Indians over a long period. It is a process because colonial consciousness reproduces itself, colonial consciousness is transmitted from generation to generation and it is learnt. Consequently, we need to understand the mechanisms of this process and the structure of that event.\nAt the minimum, this process has to be cognitive in nature. It must be cognitive because a cognitive framework (and theories within that framework) denies access to our experience and makes us reproduce some sets of descriptions as though they are descriptions of our experience. It has to be cognitive at the minimum because in reproducing some sets of descriptions and in embellishing them with details, we act as though we understand such descriptions. In other words, the growth and spread of colonial consciousness requires some kind of a cognitive explanation.\nWhen we talk about colonial consciousness, we face four kinds of issues, none of which should be lost sight of. The first issue is about the nature of that experience which we do talk about, when we use colonial descriptions. In some articles, I have called it \u0026ldquo;the colonial experience\u0026rdquo;. What is this \u0026ldquo;colonial experience\u0026rdquo;?\nFor the time being, the word \u0026lsquo;colonial experience\u0026rsquo; picks out the experience of the colonial masters and their subjects. The colonial masters described their experience but in the belief that they were describing the world (and the colonized).They described their experience in terms of the features of the world that generated such an experience. How could a description of some features of the world be the same as a description of the experience of some aspects of the world? Under some (unspecified and at the moment unspecifiable) assumptions about human psychology, we need to add the premise that unless we are hallucinating, our experience of the world is veridical. (That is, unless we are hallucinating, our senses tell us what there is in the world.) This is a premise that all human beings normally accept. Therefore, in and of itself, there is nothing surprising that the colonial masters should describe their experience in terms of the nature of colonial subjects. (They experienced Indians as lazy, corrupt, dishonest, backward, immoral, etc. This was their experience but they formulated it in terms of the features of the world.) In this sense, the descriptions of their experience were not subjective but wholly objective. In fact, we can show that the colonial masters are wrong only because they have provided us with objective (and not subjective) descriptions of the world. My research programme, unlike the others, does not deny objectivity to these descriptions by suggesting that such descriptions are not describing some features of the world and that they have to be explained by appealing to \u0026lsquo;racism\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;white superiority\u0026rsquo; or any number of such assumptions. Instead, I guarantee objectivity to these descriptions by anchoring them in the culture of the colonial masters. This is required because the belief that such descriptions are objective descriptions was very much part of the colonial experience.\nFor their part, the colonized accepted such descriptions as descriptions of their experience of the world. (There is also another way of saying the same, which does not appear very productive: the colonized accepted the claims of the colonizers as objective descriptions of the world as well.) There arises a crucial question now: if the Indian culture differs from the western culture, there will have to be a mismatch between the way the west described its experience of the Indian culture and the way Indians experienced themselves. Assuming this, what made Indians even think that the British experience of India was also the Indian experience of their own culture? This question becomes even more acute because of another claim I am developing in the course of my research: one of the characteristic aspects of the Indian culture has been its continuous emphasis on reflecting on experience. Consequently, what made the Indian intellectuals blind to the nature of their own experience?\nAs of now, I have answered this general question with three sub-hypotheses. Each of these hypotheses corresponds to the three other issues that we should not lose sight of when speaking about colonial consciousness.\nThe first is the hypothesis about the Islamic rule. I believe that it was not a mere rule but a colonization of India instead. Islamic colonization did what any and every colonialism does: it denies access to experience. By destroying (and thus arresting) the learning and teaching processes of reflecting on experience, Islamic colonialism created a vacuum. By the time the British colonized India, by and large, the intellectuals had already \u0026lsquo;forgotten\u0026rsquo; how to reflect on their own experiences. Islamic colonialism created a class of pundits, who were mostly divorced from the activity of producing knowledge, which, in India, was strictly tied to reflections on experience. Not that such pundits did not exist in India before the Islamic colonization. They did. However, Islamic colonization transformed them into the only guardians of the Indian intellectual tradition. British colonialism marginalized these pundits even more by creating a new class of intellectuals who were even further divorced (than these pundits) from the activity of producing knowledge that is characteristic of our culture. In destroying the class of Indian intellectuals, Islamic colonization damaged the Indian culture but did not destroy it. What was destroyed (in the process of damaging the culture) was both the production of and the capacity to produce our \u0026rsquo;equivalent\u0026rsquo; of the western theories. Such damage is equivalent to destroying the institutions of learning in the west: it cripples the culture for a time, but the configuration of learning will (sooner or later) allow the reemergence of theoretical knowledge. This is the first sub-hypothesis.\nThe second sub-hypothesis follows upon the heels of the first. The framework that the British introduced did two things. Firstly, that framework secularized the Christian framework. For instance, it recast the nature of Indian traditions in terms of religions; it described Hinduism as a variant of Catholic Christianity and Buddhism as a variant of Protestant reformation. The tyranny of priesthood was as prevalent in India as it was in all heathen religions (including the heathen Catholicism). Entry into the temples became an important slogan because, the British thought, the power of the Brahminical \u0026lsquo;priests\u0026rsquo; was located in their temples and the concomitant priestly powers. Breaking the powers of the \u0026lsquo;priest craft\u0026rsquo; would be accomplished by insisting upon \u0026lsquo;universal entry\u0026rsquo; into the \u0026lsquo;Hindu\u0026rsquo; temples. And so on. Much of what they said and did can be shown to derive from this process of secularization. Secondly, this framework attached itself to reference points of the daily life and transformed them into elements of experience of the Indian culture itself. That is to say, this framework filled the vacuum that the Islamic colonization had created and began to function the way Indian theories had done before.\nThe last sentence requires some further explication. While Islamic colonization destroyed the centres of learning and arrested the process of reflections on experience, it did not provide the Indian culture either with an alternate way of reflecting on experience or with an alternate framework for reflecting on experience. It merely created a vacuum without putting anything else in the place of what it destroyed. The British colonialism did not destroy any centre of learning (partly because there were no such centres left to destroy) but, instead, filled the vacuum created by Islam. (When the British colonized us, the regeneration was already taking place in the Indian culture. This is evidenced in the way the Indian culture had begun to grow new traditions arising out of its contact with Islam. However, this process of regeneration was just in its early phases.) Its framework identified reference points (the massive \u0026lsquo;illiteracy\u0026rsquo; of the Brahmins in their own \u0026lsquo;shastras\u0026rsquo;, for instance) and began to function as an explanation of (and thus a reflection about) of these reference points. Indians took to these explanations the way ducks take to water because they saw in this framework and its explanations something they were already familiar with: reflections and theorizing about experience. By identifying these reference points with the Indian culture, the British created a class of intellectuals who accepted the claims of the British (about the caste system, about \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;Buddhism\u0026rsquo;, and so on.).\nHowever, it is one thing to believe that the description of the colonizer\u0026rsquo;s experience of the world is also the experience of the colonized but it is quite another thing altogether to \u0026lsquo;discover\u0026rsquo; that it is also the same. When the two are not the same, there are only two ways to make them the same. The first is to deny oneself the access to one\u0026rsquo;s experience; the second, to the extent the mismatch keeps intruding, is to transform the description of the colonizer until it rhymes with the experience. I have already spoken of the first way in the above paragraph; therefore, let me look at the second way.\nThis, then, is the third hypothesis. We will have taken over the descriptions of the British and transformed them in such a way that they make surfacial sense to us (because they pick out the reference points the British identified). In the process, we will have created a demonstrable distance between the meanings and references contained in the colonial descriptions and our use of the same words. Given my research project, this distance can be \u0026lsquo;predicted\u0026rsquo;: the words we borrow will have no semantic connection with their meanings in the discourse used by the British and we will not be able to provide any reference to such words.\nIf the above sounds abstract, let me make it concrete. For instance, the British said that Hinduism is in need of a reformation. When they made such or similar statements, they had a very specific set of ideas in mind: Catholicism (and heathendom generally) is the sway of the priests who rule over the gullible. They do so by pretending that the prescriptions and the laws they, the priests, formulate are also the laws and prescriptions of God following which is necessary to salvation. Such additions corrupt the true religion not only because such laws are immoral but also because any human addition to the revelation of God is a corruption of the true religion. They saw such a priestcraft in Hinduism, such a protestant reformation in Buddhism. Of course, they merely said that Buddhism was the protestant reformation of India and not that following Buddhism allows one to seek salvation.\nGiven the absence of religion in India, there is no way on earth we could have understood the claims of the British (let alone the nuances in their claims). However, we would twist and distort them until it makes sense to us: we would have interpreted \u0026lsquo;reformation\u0026rsquo; as the \u0026lsquo;process of introducing reforms\u0026rsquo; (the way one reforms \u0026rsquo;laws\u0026rsquo; and \u0026rsquo;education system\u0026rsquo;). To us, there would be no difference between \u0026lsquo;social reform\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;religious reform\u0026rsquo;: human beings in quest of a \u0026lsquo;better\u0026rsquo; system would undertake both. The clarion calls of the Indian \u0026lsquo;religious reformers\u0026rsquo; of yesteryears or of the Yahoo internet group \u0026lsquo;Navya Shastra\u0026rsquo; of today would be to \u0026lsquo;reform Hinduism\u0026rsquo; so that it suits our modern day sensibilities. Not only that. Even the \u0026lsquo;rejection\u0026rsquo; of \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; will have followed the same lines: the belief that \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; is too corrupt to be \u0026lsquo;reformed\u0026rsquo; (because, say, of the caste system) and one should leave its folds and seek something \u0026lsquo;better\u0026rsquo; elsewhere (Buddhism or Christianity because, say, they do not support a \u0026lsquo;caste system\u0026rsquo;). That means to say, both the \u0026lsquo;religious\u0026rsquo; reformers and the \u0026lsquo;rebels\u0026rsquo; against the caste system would share the same conviction: \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; is in need of \u0026lsquo;reform\u0026rsquo;. It is antiquated, backward and a hindrance to everything that we believe in: equality of human beings, of widows, of the need for progress and change…\nIn the process of understanding \u0026lsquo;reform\u0026rsquo; this way, we would completely fail to understand what the British said or what they could possibly mean. What makes a religion corrupt, to repeat, is the fact that human beings add to God\u0026rsquo;s revelation. Reformation rebelled against these additions (like the canon laws, the practice of indulgences, and so on). The Indian \u0026lsquo;reformers\u0026rsquo;, in the name of the same reformation, want to \u0026lsquo;delete\u0026rsquo; things from \u0026lsquo;original revelation\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;add\u0026rsquo; new things, all of which are the results of human deliberations! In short, they look at \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; as a creation of human beings (the way laws and education systems are) and want to \u0026lsquo;modernize\u0026rsquo; it. In the eyes of the Protestants, it would be an abomination to put them in the same league as the Indian \u0026lsquo;religious\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;social\u0026rsquo; reformers. However, the Indian \u0026lsquo;reformers\u0026rsquo; are totally oblivious to the situation. They repeat the British and, in doing so, they act as though they understand the British claims. Yet, when they ask the opposite of what the British could ever have asked for, they show us that they have no understanding of the British criticisms. This is an example of what I call colonial consciousness.\nSuch a consciousness is characterized by a double impotency. It is impotent to access its cultural experience. Where it does read the \u0026lsquo;shastras\u0026rsquo; or uses \u0026rsquo;technical terms\u0026rsquo; from them that have become a part of the daily language-use (\u0026lsquo;atman\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;chitta\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;kosha\u0026rsquo;, Buddhi\u0026rsquo;, etc), it has no understanding of their meaning or reference. It is equally impotent to access the outlines of the experience of the western culture. Such impotent consciousness constitutes the class of Indian intellectuals today. Is there any wonder that they fail to produce any interesting reflections on either \u0026lsquo;secularism\u0026rsquo; or political or cultural theory? Is there any wonder they are also incapable of bringing about any regeneration of the Indian culture? Most Pundits in India, the fossils created by Islam, reproduce Indian \u0026lsquo;shatsras\u0026rsquo; mantrically without making any original contribution. The modern Indian intellectuals, another fossil created by the British, reproduce western claims equally mantrically without being able to make any original contribution to the regeneration of the Indian culture. Neither the children of the mullahs nor the children of Macaulay should belong anywhere other than in a Jurassic Park. I hope we can build such parks soon.\n","tags":[],"title":"Colonial Consciousness as a process and as an event","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/colonial-consciousness-as-a-process-and-as-an-event/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","published"],"content":"Speaking of \u0026rsquo;the greatest mystery of our humanness\u0026rsquo;, Sinari raises the following questions: \u0026ldquo;Why are we present in the world rather than not being there at all? Why are we present to ourselves as world-experiencers and world-explorers rather than being simply there as perhaps animals are\u0026rdquo; (p.1) In brief reply to his provocative paper, I would like to reflect on the nature of these queries and with the issue: what would count as an answer to these questions\nEXPLANATORY ACCOUNTS AND INTELLIGIBLE CONSIDERATIONS Let me take a simple example to focus on the issue very quickly. Imagine a non-smoker objecting to others smoking in his presence. Let us say that we need an account of this objecting behavior: Why does he object if others smoke in his presence? Consider two kinds of accounts, an explanatory and an intelligible one, given in answer to the above question.\nOne could make the objecting response of the non-smoker intelligible by appealing to the (reasonable and justifiable) beliefs held by him: he believes that smoking is injurious to one\u0026rsquo;s health; that passive smoking is also a form of smoking; and that he does not desire to injure his health … etc[1]. We can understand his behavior as an intentional act. Why does this non-smoker object to others smoking in his presence? \u0026ldquo;Because\u0026rdquo;, so the intelligible account goes on, \u0026ldquo;he believes that …\u0026rdquo; The ellipsis would get filled-in by these above beliefs. It is important to note that his beliefs are connected to his actions by means of principle(s) of sound reasoning.\nBecause I merely want to illustrate the difference between the two kinds of accounts using the same example, let me introduce myself into this picture as a possessor of some piece of information. Let us suppose that I am his friend and that one day, in strict confidence (which I am, alas, breaking for the good of science), he informed me that he cannot stand the smell of smoke. He does not believe that the smell of the smoke is injurious to one\u0026rsquo;s health at all. Smirking smugly, I now tell you that the cause of his objecting behavior has nothing to do with his \u0026lsquo;beliefs\u0026rsquo;. \u0026ldquo;Because\u0026rdquo;, I say grinning from ear to ear, \u0026ldquo;he cannot stand the smell of smoke …\u0026rdquo; [2]\nWhile more could be said about the issue than what I have said, it is neither central nor relevant for my concerns to do so. The only point is to see that we have two kinds of accounts, an explanatory account and an intelligible one, each of which appears to focus on different questions. Consider now one possible answer to Prof. Sinari\u0026rsquo;s questions. We are present in the world rather not being there at all because we have evolved from certain kind of animal; and that our self-consciousness is an emergent property of a sufficiently complex system; and the like. Would an evolutionary explanation which appeals to causes constitute a satisfactory answer? Even though one may be willing countenance it as a part of an answer, to construe it as the complete answer is to succumb to reductionist temptations—if I understand Prof. Sinari correctly. In other words, we need to give reasons as well in answering the query: why are we there the way we are instead of being there in another way? It is not just our humanness that must be made intelligible, but also the causal explanation that springs from it. That is, one must not only \u0026ldquo;be aware of the world as a train of meanings\u0026rdquo; (p.7), realize that the \u0026ldquo;thereness … of the world … springs … from the subjectivity of the perceiver\u0026rdquo; (ibid.), but also needs to account for the raison d\u0026rsquo;etre and ultimate validity of scientific explanations\u0026quot; (p.19). What would constitute a satisfactory answer to Prof. Sinari\u0026rsquo;s questions? An account which not only appeals to causes but also makes the latter intelligible. Causes alone are not enough, we need reasons as well. That is to say, we need an explanatory and intelligible account of why we are there in the world rather than not being there at all.\nHaving established this much, I shall now reverse my argument. I shall argue that the desiderata as an answer is not so much that it is explanatorily intelligible but that one can ask these questions only because of the presence of such an account in the background. It is only within the framework of an explanatorily intelligible account of the world that we can raise such questions, and not otherwise. Its implications will tell us both about the topicality and the future of philosophical anthropology.\nEXPLANATORY INTELLIGIBLE ACCOUNT What would an explanatory intelligible account look like? Consider an account, which suggests or hints that some sets of actions are intelligible because they instantiate some set of beliefs. And that the relationship between \u0026lsquo;intending\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;acting\u0026rsquo; is not only constant but that nothing else interferes between the former and the latter to such an extent that they virtually become identical. To those from the outside who only observe the actions, knowledge of these actions is sufficient to draw inferences about the reasons for these actions. There is only one proviso attached. Because the observer\u0026rsquo;s knowledge of these actions is always framed in some description or the other, one can only read-off the purposes of the actions exhaustively if the descriptions of these actions are themselves exhaustive. That is to say, a complete and totally accurate description of the actions is required before we can be said to have a complete knowledge of the reasons for the actions. Such an account, when it is forthcoming, of such set of actions, if they are possible, of such a being, if it exists, together will give us an explanatory intelligible account of that being and its actions. The reason for calling it thus must be obvious: the causes of actions are also its reasons. Further, because each type of action instantiates one and only purpose, prediction becomes possible as well. The causal law will be general, predictive power is not reduced, and the causes are intentions of such a being.\nSuppose that we now have a doctrine which says the following: such a being exists, such actions exist as well, but we could never provide a complete description of the actions of such a being. At best, we could have a very partial and fragmented description of such actions, but we cannot possibly observe all the actions of that being either. Further it adds that this being has communicated its purposes to us the understandability of this message is again restricted by descriptive possibilities open to us. In such a case, we have two sources of knowledge: some set of actions that we try to understand; and the message, which we try to make sense of. Let us further suppose that this being is \u0026lsquo;The Elusive Man\u0026rsquo; referred to in the title of the paper and that his actions are the universe. His message is precisely the above doctrine. His Will holds the universe together and constitutes its \u0026lsquo;cement\u0026rsquo;. His reasons are also the causes such that \u0026lsquo;causal\u0026rsquo; relations express his intentions.\nIf and when you have such an account, it makes sense to ask \u0026ldquo;Why are we present in the world rather than not being there at all? Why are we present to ourselves as world-experiencers and world-explorers rather than being simply there as perhaps animals are?\u0026rdquo; (p.1) and seek answers to these questions. By now, of course, you will have realized that I have provided you with an admittedly crude outline of \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo;. Not any religion, but the Biblical one.\nCULTURES AND PHILOSOPHICAL ANTHROPOLOGY This, then, is what I want to argue. Western culture, an appellation that suggests neither monolithicity nor absence of diversity, has been dominated by religion for more than 1800 years. Religion is not only an explanatory intelligible account of the cosmos, but also the only we know of. It is important to realize that religion makes the cosmos an explanatory intelligible entity, not by providing an account of several set of phenomena, but by saying that it is so and structuring the experience accordingly [3]. Only because the world is asserted to exemplify the reasons and purposes of God, could one ask for the reasons and purposes for the way things are: Why this way and not another way? As time progressed, this framework faded into the background; but what have not faded are the questioned raised within it. They continue to haunt us to this day. I just said that questions raised within the framework of the Biblical religion continue to haunt us. Who is this \u0026lsquo;us\u0026rsquo; anyhow?\nUnless one assumes the truth of the Bible that God gave one religion to mankind, something I certainly cannot subscribe to, we are faced with the following empirical diversity: there exist other cultures and groups to whom the universe does not exemplify either a plan or a purpose (or even a set of them) of a divine, semi-divine or even a primeval being. No Will governs the universe; all that was, is, and shall be does not embody anyone\u0026rsquo;s Will. How, then, can the questions of the philosophical anthropology—the Quest for Man, nota bene—be those that can only be raised within the framework of the Bible? How can the secularized questions of a religion turn out to be the questions of humankind and in answering them \u0026rsquo;the Quest for Man\u0026rsquo;? They cannot; unless one presupposes the truth of the Bible and, as said already, I do not subscribe to it. These are merely the questions about human beings raised by a culture—they are neither universal nor do they tell us much about mankind.\nI beg, therefore, to submit to you that the future of philosophical anthropology does not lie in giving an Asian, African or an American-Indian answer to the western (religious) questions about man. Rather, the quest for man involves, in the first place, raising Asian, African, and American-Indian questions about \u0026lsquo;man\u0026rsquo;. To do so, I suggest, is what makes philosophical anthropology \u0026rsquo;topical\u0026rsquo;. In my modest opinion, the future of philosophical anthropology does not lie in its past; the questions we have come across are those that belong to the past of a culture. Not merely are they questions from a past (human history does contain multiple pasts, of course) but they are also, by virtue of this, well and truly past. This is the challenge of the future. Whether intellectuals from other cultures and groups are up to this task, however, is a totally different issue.\nREFERENCES:\nThe \u0026rsquo;etcetera\u0026rsquo; clause requires further filling out before we could consider it an account of the objecting behavior. Of course, I need some kind of (contingent) causal law governing human behavior before I could be said to have a causal explanation. I cannot argue for it here in any detail but have done so in Comparative Science of Cultures and the Universality of Religion.

One is by talking about \u0026lsquo;how the world is\u0026rsquo;; the other is by talking about \u0026lsquo;how we think the world is\u0026rsquo;. Even though we could use both ways to characterize \u0026lsquo;ignorance\u0026rsquo;, they are not coextensive (or synonyms) because (a) they are about different things – in the first case it is about the world; in the second case it is about what we take to exist in the world – and, therefore, (b) they have different consequences.\nLet me illustrate this difference by taking up the snake-rope metaphor. The first way says how the world is: \u0026rsquo;there is a rope on the path\u0026rsquo;. The second talks about what we take to exist in the world: \u0026lsquo;she believed that there was a snake on the path\u0026rsquo;. What caused the person to shudder? Her belief that there was a snake on the path. This distinction is easily understood in this case because we are able to neatly partition the two halves: what there is in the world and what we believe to exist in the world.\nOur problem begins when we go to the next stage of questioning: how do we explain our reactions in the world? Let us use the snake-rope metaphor again: (i) she did not at all know what was there on the path; (ii) she did not know that there was a rope was on the path; (iii) she believed that a snake was on the path. However, why shudder? The fact that she did not at all know what was there on the path does not explain the event of shuddering: if you do not know what there is, you do not shudder (assuming some facts about human psychology). Neither does the second possibility explain: if you do not know that a rope was on the path, you do not shudder either. However, provided we know that she shuddered, we can look elsewhere for an explanation for the shudder. If we do not at all know how the person reacted, then the sentence (\u0026lsquo;she did not know there was a rope on the path\u0026rsquo;) appears incomplete: why talk about what she did not know? For this sentence to be complete, we need to know how the person responded. If we know this, and also know what there is in the world, then the second possibility functions as a heuristic in looking for explanations. Like all heuristics, this sentence appeals to what we assume to be true about human psychology.\nSo, the first possibility, namely she did not know what was there on the path, merely tells us what she did not know. However, this sentence cannot explain anything, even if we knew how the person reacted. Nor does it tell us where to look for an explanation. If we are merely told that the person did not know what was on the path and that the person shuddered, we can come up with any \u0026rsquo;explanation\u0026rsquo;: the person might have suddenly felt chilly; the person might have remembered some incident; the person might have seen a ghost; and so on. Assuming that a person was walking on the path, the sentence takes the following form: \u0026lsquo;she shuddered and did not know what was on the path\u0026rsquo;. Could we say \u0026lsquo;she shuddered because of the ignorance of what was on the path?\u0026rsquo; We cannot: to say this, we have to further assume that the shudder had to do with what was there on the path. But this is merely an assumption on our part; we do not know this to be true. So all we can do is take the sentence at its face value and let the conjunction (\u0026lsquo;and\u0026rsquo;) function purely linguistically: \u0026ldquo;the person did not know what was on the path and he shuddered\u0026rdquo;.\nIn the second case, by telling us what was there on the path, namely a rope, and telling us that the person did not know this, the sentence suggests that we need to relate the shudder to \u0026lsquo;something\u0026rsquo; on the path. That is to say, the second possibility tells us more. It tells us that the response has something to do with what was on the path, viz., a rope and that it has also something to do with the ignorance of the person about that fact. If we draw upon our knowledge of human psychology to explain the shudder, then we can begin formulating the problem: \u0026lsquo;what could appear like a rope and cause a shudder in a human being?\u0026rsquo; In this sense, this sentence forces us to look for something else that explains the shudder and puts some minimal constraints on what that explanation should look like. But this constraint is minimal: it merely allows us to assume that the fact that he does not know the truth about the world has something to do with his response. However, neither of the two explains on its own in the sense that we need to add additional premises, if we have to explain the shudder. This is what \u0026lsquo;ignorance\u0026rsquo; is: absence of knowledge.\nHowever, there is an interesting difference between these two cases. In the first case, ignorance, or absence of knowledge, is with respect to what there is in the world. Were we to know how we react in the world and also know which aspect of the world we react to, even then, we cannot choose between the different explanations as to why we react the way we do. We would also not know where to look for that \u0026lsquo;right\u0026rsquo; explanation. We know that the person shuddered and we also know that the person did not know what was on the path. But it is not clear whether the person reacted to something on the path and what, if any, her ignorance (or absence of knowledge) about that aspect of the world had to do with the act of shuddering. In other words, the mere fact of ignorance about some aspect of the world and our responses in the world does not tell us what, if any, is the relationship between some aspect of the world and our responses to it. We would suspect that there is a problem to be solved (or that we should provide an explanation) without knowing what precisely that problem is. We get an ill-defined problem where we have to answer questions about our reactions. Our ignorance about some aspect of the world does not even contribute to defining the problem-situation. That is to say, our problem becomes one of explaining why some person shudders. That person\u0026rsquo;s lack of knowledge about what there was on the path merely tells us where that incident took place; it is not even obvious that the path has anything to do with the event of shuddering.\nWith respect to suffering, this possibility is akin to the following: you are suffering and you do not know the nature and structure of the Cosmos. It might be the case they are related; it might be the case they are unrelated. All you have on your hands is the following: why are you suffering? We do not know where to look for the answer.\nThe second case narrows our field of search. It tells us that we are ignorant of some specific fact about some specific aspect of the world. Or it characterizes our ignorance as an absence of some specific knowledge item. It circumscribes our ignorance in terms of the truth about the world: the world is structured in \u0026lsquo;some way\u0026rsquo; (\u0026ldquo;there is a rope on the path\u0026rdquo;) and that we are ignorant of this structure. Because of this circumscription, this functions as a heuristic. It tells us to draw upon the knowledge we already have about the relevant aspects of the world (our ideas about human psychology) to frame the problem. It does not explain or solve the problem of the shudder but it tells you about the likely place you have to search in, if you want a solution.\nWith respect to suffering, the above takes the following form: \u0026lsquo;you are suffering because you do not know things are transient and impermanent\u0026rsquo;. We can appreciate why this puts only minimal constraints on our explanation because we can easily imagine a response that goes as follows: \u0026ldquo;of course, I know things are transient and impermanent; that is why I lost my wife to death. Hence the reason for my suffering \u0026ldquo;. We can also imagine an analogous response with respect to our metaphor: \u0026ldquo;of course I know that it is a rope; that is why I shudder; the rope makes me think of the gallows.\u0026rdquo; In other words, even if we were to supplant ignorance of some particular fact with knowledge about the same, our explanation could turn out to be wrong. We need to further assume that the assumptions we make about human psychology also hold true in particular cases.\nShe shudders because she thinks there is a snake. Now, if we know the structure of the world (or believe we know it), we can characterize this is a false belief. There are two important things to note here. First: the belief might be false, but she believes that it is true (at that moment). That is to say, the presence of this belief and assumption she makes about its truth are required to explain why she shudders. Second: one can say that this belief is false provided we know either (a) there could have been no snake there or (b) there was a rope. This either/or is not the same: in one case we know that there could be no snake (even if we do not know what else was there); in the other we know what there is.\nIn the snake-rope metaphor, the absence of knowledge does not/cannot explain the shudder; false belief does. This is the point I have been repeatedly making. Indeed, one of the explanations for suffering in the world is the set of (false) beliefs which we entertain because we think they are true: the \u0026lsquo;I\u0026rsquo; is the body, the mind, wealth, power, status, etc.\nWhen I speak of \u0026lsquo;ignorance\u0026rsquo; conceived negatively, I have the \u0026lsquo;absence of knowledge\u0026rsquo; mind. I say that this does not explain suffering (any more than it explains the shudder in the snake-rope metaphor). However, when I want to speak of \u0026ldquo;ignorance conceived as a positive force\u0026rdquo;, I want to talk of something entirely different. I am trying to answer the following question: why do people, across generations and cultures, come to have the same sets of commonsense beliefs about who they are? I mean to ask: why is it that every human being (more or less) learns that the \u0026lsquo;I\u0026rsquo; is the body, the mind, wealth, power, status? This question opens up a hornet\u0026rsquo;s nest. Let me outline some of the issues.\nIn the first place, we have to describe a learning process as something that produces false beliefs about the nature of the \u0026lsquo;I\u0026rsquo;. In some senses, there is something strange about coupling a learning process with the production of false beliefs. In our language-use, we speak of knowledge as the product of a learning process. That is to say, we tend to speak of learning only when such a process leads to knowledge acquisition. Even though unclear about what the relationship between truth and knowledge is, we relate knowledge to truth and not to falsity. At the minimum, we do not say that some sets of sentences are \u0026lsquo;false\u0026rsquo; and thus \u0026lsquo;knowledge\u0026rsquo;. In this sense, there is the problem of making sense of a learning process that produces false beliefs even if the object under question is the \u0026lsquo;I\u0026rsquo;.\nOne way of solving this problem is to suggest that we constantly formulate hypotheses about the world to account for what we see and do. Then we have a situation where we make best guesses about the world (our hypotheses), which we entertain only as long as they are not proved false or better ones do not come along. Instead of speaking about how knowledgeable we are, we can only speak about how ignorant we are. \u0026lsquo;Truth\u0026rsquo; becomes the end-goal of our hypothesis production. In this case, we can speak about learning as an act of hypothesis generation.\nWhether we take this route or not, there is a second notable problem. To what should we appeal in order to explain why all people come up with the same (or similar) hypothesis regarding the \u0026lsquo;I\u0026rsquo;? One of the strategies used in the natural sciences is the following: postulate a new hypothesis about the same phenomenon and show how (minimally) the earlier hypothesis and its consequences are derivable from the new hypothesis. Formulated differently: make a distinction between \u0026lsquo;appearance\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;reality\u0026rsquo; and show that the nature of reality generates the structure of the appearance. For instance: we believed in the geocentric nature of the solar system. By relegating it to the world of appearance, the reality was shown to be the heliocentric in nature. The appearance (movement) of the sun became a necessary consequence that required an explanation.\nIf we take the Indian insights into the nature of the \u0026lsquo;I\u0026rsquo; seriously, we see that this approach will not work. The reality of the \u0026lsquo;I\u0026rsquo; does not in any sense cause the illusion that the \u0026lsquo;I\u0026rsquo; is the body, the mind, agency, wealth, power, or whatever else. Consequently, we are forced to rethink the relationship between how we experience the \u0026lsquo;I\u0026rsquo; and the nature of the \u0026lsquo;I\u0026rsquo;. Our experiences of the \u0026lsquo;I\u0026rsquo; are not the appearances; the true \u0026lsquo;I\u0026rsquo; is not the reality hidden behind the appearances.\nIf this is the case, enlightenment is not a movement that traces the effects to their cause. We cannot describe the experience of the \u0026lsquo;I\u0026rsquo; as a logical consequence of the structure of the \u0026lsquo;I\u0026rsquo;. These two belong to different realms or levels without a causal or a logical relationship between them. Nevertheless, it is possible to move from the level of experience to the other level.\nThus, the Indian traditions cannot possibly claim that our experiential world is an illusion, underlying which there is the \u0026lsquo;real\u0026rsquo; world. Therefore, \u0026lsquo;Maaya\u0026rsquo; cannot be an \u0026lsquo;illusion\u0026rsquo; and unreal. In so far as \u0026lsquo;Maaya\u0026rsquo; is responsible for our daily experiences in the world, if anything, \u0026lsquo;Maaya\u0026rsquo; would be real and be a cause of our experiential world. This brings us to the next problem.\nWe have now two sets of questions. One pertains to the generation of false beliefs about the \u0026lsquo;I\u0026rsquo;; the second is about the nature of reality. Let us begin with the first one. \u0026lsquo;Maaya\u0026rsquo; is itself the learning process or the learning process is an element (or a component) of \u0026lsquo;Maaya\u0026rsquo;. The learning process generates certain false beliefs about the world. Either this learning process itself is \u0026lsquo;Maaya\u0026rsquo; or, other things, components of \u0026lsquo;Maaya\u0026rsquo;, contribute to the generation and fixation (or reproduction) of these false beliefs. Let us work with this hypothesis for some time and turn our attention to the second set of questions.\n\u0026lsquo;Maaya\u0026rsquo; is real (because it exists) and so are its effects. The \u0026lsquo;I\u0026rsquo; is also real. So, either we talk about two \u0026lsquo;realities\u0026rsquo;, the \u0026lsquo;false reality\u0026rsquo; and the \u0026rsquo;true reality\u0026rsquo; or we say that \u0026rsquo;existence\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;reality\u0026rsquo; do not coincide: what exists is not real just because it exists. So, we have to say, \u0026lsquo;Maaya\u0026rsquo; exists; so do its effects. But neither is real. Quite apart from saying what \u0026lsquo;reality\u0026rsquo; and \u0026rsquo;existence\u0026rsquo; mean in this context, we are confronted by yet another weighty problem: that of truth.\nConsider our commonsense notion of truth, often called the \u0026lsquo;Aristotelian concept of truth\u0026rsquo;, which says that \u0026ldquo;truth is to describe what is there as it is there\u0026rdquo;. For the moment, let us accept the idea that \u0026rsquo;truth\u0026rsquo; is a linguistic property of statements. That is to say, let us agree that we can speak sensibly about whether or not some sentence is true. If we accept this convention, we can say the following: the statements that describe existence are true; the statements that describe the real are also true. That is, it is true that the \u0026lsquo;I\u0026rsquo; is body etc because this \u0026lsquo;I\u0026rsquo; exists; it is also true that \u0026lsquo;I\u0026rsquo; is not body etc. because this \u0026lsquo;I\u0026rsquo; is real. Some statement about the \u0026lsquo;I\u0026rsquo; is either true or false depending on what it describes: whether it describes what exists or whether it describes what is real. (We need to keep in mind that both what exists and what is real can be experienced.) We can avoid the problem of speaking about two kinds of truth, the conventional truth and the Adhyatmic truth, by distinguishing between what exists and what is real.\nHowever, many Indian traditions also use the predicate \u0026rsquo;truth\u0026rsquo; to characterize what is real. The real is what is permanent, unchanging and unconditioned. It is rather tempting to suggest that such ideas about the real are derivative of our linguistic intuitions about the nature of truth: a true statement remains true under all circumstances; a true statement does not become false; and so on. If we go in this direction, we can understand why the Indian traditions claim that the real is permanent, unchanging and unconditioned: they have simply projected the linguistic intuitions about truth onto the world. We can also show that logic and philosophy has progressed since then because we are able to retain these linguistic intuitions without having to speak about the world in these terms. Furthermore, we can also give up the distinction between reality and existence. Our ontologies take on manageable forms.\nThough tempting, the above route faces two kinds of difficulties. The first involves some of the assumptions it makes: (a) with respect to the Indian thinkers, we have made progress in the area they were busy with; (b) the problems of contemporary philosophy and that of the Indian thinkers are the same; (c) our language-use almost completely determines our experiences; (d) the experiences of the Indian thinkers require no further explanation than that they were mistaken; and so on.\nThe second kind of difficulties has to do with what it cannot explain satisfactorily. (a) Why do the idea and the process of \u0026ldquo;a search for truth\u0026rdquo; resonate so deeply in the Indian traditions? (b) Why downsize the possibility that the Indian thinkers were busy in making sense of experience? (c) Why should there not be an experience of the real \u0026lsquo;I\u0026rsquo;? (d) How to make sense of the experience of those many Gurus who also talk in terms similar to those from yesteryears? And so on.\nThis lengthy digression had to do with the hornet\u0026rsquo;s nest of philosophical problems opened up by an earlier suggestion (in point 5): \u0026ldquo;why is it that every human being (more or less) learns that the \u0026lsquo;I\u0026rsquo; is the body, the mind, wealth, power, status?\u0026rdquo; Answering this question in a satisfactory way requires a hypothesis that is powerful enough to suggest answers also to some of the problems mentioned above.\nCurrently, I am working with a hypothesis which includes the two notions of ignorance that the Indian traditions talk about. The first looks at Ignorance as the absence of knowledge (see point 3). This kind of ignorance is a precondition for knowledge. We want to have knowledge precisely because we are ignorant.\nThen, there is ignorance conceived as a learning process. This learning process is a hindrance to knowledge because it continually generates false beliefs about the world. The point to note here is not merely the fact that we have false beliefs. If that is all there is to it, reading a Buddha or a Shankara would be sufficient to dispel all such beliefs and enlighten us. However, this happens rarely, if at all. We do not get enlightened by merely reading either the Buddha or the Upanishads because such readings do not interfere with the learning process that generates false beliefs. As long as this process continues to function, it reproduces and sustains our false beliefs. To be sure, the Indian traditions often speak about false beliefs, which knowledge dispels: they use several analogies like the sun and the mist, the light and darkness, and so on to illustrate this point. In that case, we can consistently talk about ignorance in terms of beliefs alone: the absence of beliefs about some object and the presence of false beliefs about the same object. While this would be convenient, it could also makes us forget the more important question: why is there a necessity for false beliefs, i.e., why do all of us succumb to false beliefs so easily? In order not to lose this focus, I speak about ignorance as a learning process.Note: If enlightenment were to be evidenced by psychological and behavioral patterns, it is possible to say whether or not someone is enlightened. However, if enlightenment is to be evidenced by one’s complete access to the real, there are no facts of the matter. We know we have a partial access to the ‘I’, the real. (This is a hypothesis.) One can think of a full access as well. The ‘I-ness’ and the ‘I-hood’ are facts. Question is: what explains them? One route is to postulate the ‘causes’ in the world. The other is to postulate human access to the real. The first has brought us nowhere so far; it has increased human misery on a gigantic scale. However, if and when such an explanation comes, it would be empirically ‘testable’ (in some senses). The other explanation is not ‘empirical’ (in the sense that it is not about ‘causal’ facts), but it helps human beings find happiness. What would one like to choose? The choice has to be made on pragmatic grounds.\n","tags":[],"title":"Avidya, Ajnana, Maaya, Ignorance: a learning process","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/avidya-ajnana-ignorance-a-learning-process-s-n-balagangadhara/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","colonial consciousness","enlightenment","experience","psychology"],"content":"In this post, I want to reflect on what it means to access and think about experience. Perhaps, not so much on what these words mean but what is entailed by (or what happens when we indulge in) this kind of activity. I think the best way to begin this analysis is by asking the following two questions about an activity familiar to most of us: what do we do when we think about ourselves? Do we do it the \u0026lsquo;right\u0026rsquo; way? Let me begin with the first question and postpone looking at the second for a later stage, including how we should understand it. Because most of us know how we think about ourselves most of the times, I will take a trivial example and skip over certain explanations and analyses. The holes in my reasoning can either be filled by our memories or by discussing them at a later stage.\nLet us suppose, and it is true by the way, that I lose my temper rather quickly. This makes me say unfortunate things which I regret later on or wish I had not said. Repetitive experiences of such situations make me \u0026lsquo;want\u0026rsquo; to control either my temper or control my tongue when I lose my temper. However, my experiences have also taught me that I fail in doing both: infinite self-admonitions do not help; endless number of promises (that I shall not speak when angry or I shall not get angry) does not work. The only result of these efforts is being saddled with a huge sense of remorse, self-directed anger, and an increasing sense of helplessness. I know there is much at stake: I have had fights, hurt people needlessly and messed up relationships, and so on. Yet, nothing, not even a study of books on psychology, seems to help except feed the sense of helpless rage.\nNot many options are open to me: I could hope for a miracle medication (there is medication for attacks of rage but none for short temper) or undergo psychoanalysis. The first is not there yet and, for whatever reason, I do not take the second option. Books in Biology tell me that this anger is the \u0026lsquo;animal\u0026rsquo; part of me and that some or another chemical is produced too quickly in the brain. Even if this trait has survival value to my species, it is a handicap for me. So, it appears that I have to live with it, but precisely that is my problem: I cannot and do not want to live with my short temper.\nSo, I seek help by thinking about myself and by talking to others about my \u0026lsquo;problem\u0026rsquo;. Neither helps: thinking about myself, which includes detailed analyses of the situations where I have lost my temper, either makes me feel utterly despondent or even more \u0026lsquo;guilty\u0026rsquo;; sage advice of friends of \u0026lsquo;counting till ten\u0026rsquo; before speaking turns out to be impracticable: if I have the presence of mind to \u0026lsquo;count till ten\u0026rsquo; when I am angry, I would also have the presence of mind not to say the nasty things I say. This last fact, that I say nasty things too, adds an extra-weight to my self-recriminations: why do I talk (and behave) like an uncivilized brute? Perhaps, I am one such nasty creature even though I know in the heart of hearts that I am not so. My situation could be put in simple terms: I have a problem I cannot live with but I do not know (and nobody else seems to, either) how to get rid of it. At best, all I can do is to look at others and envy them: for the control they are able to exercise; for the kind of creatures they are but, alas, I am not. This, of course, makes the situation even worse: why cannot I do it, while they obviously can?\nI have said enough, I trust, to ring familiar bells in you. This is something we all know and share and, most of us, in some or another aspect of our \u0026lsquo;psychology\u0026rsquo;, would have felt this at some stage or another. We are familiar too with the endless loop these kinds of problems generate and the extra burdens they place on us. We become the most difficult persons to live with for ourselves. Somehow, we are very unhappy with the way we are and punish ourselves for that. We believe that we could be different; we genuinely wish we would change; we have the required intensity of desire and tons of motivation. Yet, all of these are to no avail. The beast simply refuses. Why?\nTo answer this simple \u0026lsquo;why\u0026rsquo;, we need to achieve some clarity first. Let us do that by noticing that two kinds of problems are entwined in the above description: (a) there is the problem of my short temper and what I do when I lose my temper; (b) there is the set of problems and feelings generated by the way I think about myself. If you look at the description closely, or look into how you think about yourself carefully, you will discover something remarkable: most of the problems that make my living so painful are generated by this way of thinking about me and not by my short temper. That is to say, it is not how I am that makes living so painful but how I think about it. The biggest problem is posed by my way of thinking about my existence. Let me call this \u0026lsquo;familiar\u0026rsquo; way of thinking about myself as \u0026ldquo;introspection\u0026rdquo;. In fact, I would suggest that the biggest obstacle to self-change is this process of introspection and not how I am.\nEven though it is extremely important for my purposes to trace the origin and crystallization of this \u0026lsquo;habit\u0026rsquo; of introspection, I will skip this bit for now. Let me just say that most of us brought up in the modern cities of India have made introspection our own by the time we reach the age of 14-16. If we also have the fortune (or the misfortune) of going abroad, then by the time we reach our thirties we are mired in this mode. It would have become a \u0026rsquo;natural\u0026rsquo; part of us. We have learnt to continuously introspect.\nThis process of introspection, which I have learnt exclusively from the West and which has been transmitted to me through the medium of modern education in India and the socializing process abroad, presupposes something about human psychology that is remarkable to say the least. It tells me that this short temper of mine expresses something unique about me and tells the world at large (including me) what kind of a creature I am. Consequently, if I want to change and grow or want to become a different person than who I am at the moment, I have to transform this short temper and all such unique qualities that I possess. That means to say, introspection presupposes that the unique nature of my existence is contained in and expressed by all (and only those) properties (like short temper) that express the unique nature of my person. To understand myself, I need to understand the nature of these unique qualities; to change myself I need the help of \u0026lsquo;depth psychology\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;psychoanalysis\u0026rsquo;, which tell me \u0026lsquo;how\u0026rsquo; to change myself.\nWhat, then, do I share in common with my fellow human beings? Basically, I share the same biological \u0026lsquo;substratum\u0026rsquo;: genes, cells, body and brain. Of course, these do have their influences on my \u0026lsquo;psychology\u0026rsquo;, but at the moment we do not know what and how these influence us. In so far as I am a member of society, the current \u0026lsquo;social psychology\u0026rsquo; tells us, I behave in certain ways which (mostly) do not synchronize with my individual psychology: I share prejudices of my community; I act irrationally when in a crowd and violently when a part of a mob and so on. In short, the social and cultural psychology tell us about the ways in which society and culture \u0026lsquo;influence\u0026rsquo; our behavior and thinking, which, of course, is mostly different from the way I am. What I am is a confluence of all the unique properties that I have.\nAs I have said often, this is only one picture about who we are and what we are. This is a story that one culture has produced about human beings. These are not \u0026lsquo;facts\u0026rsquo; about ourselves or about the way we are, even though we believe in their \u0026rsquo;truth\u0026rsquo;. Let me use a metaphor to describe this image about human beings: our biological inheritance forms the foundation of who we are. Above this foundation, a structure gets built. This structure expresses our unique nature and our individual psychology. In one sense, we are this structure. Changing ourselves requires changing this structure. Introspection involves delving into this structure; depth psychology and psychoanalysis dig deeper into this structure and relate layers from this structure to each other. The lower we go in this structure, the more we share with other human beings. The higher we go, the more unique we are. Thus, in the last analysis, depth psychology and psychoanalysis relate the structure to some or another \u0026rsquo;layer\u0026rsquo; that is common either across a small group of people (\u0026ldquo;people who were abused during their childhood\u0026rdquo;) or across a bigger layer (\u0026ldquo;the incestuous hunger of a son for his mother\u0026rdquo;). Whatever the explanation, the point is this: this structure is who we are and any analysis can only relate some layers (or some elements) of this structure to other layers or elements from the same structure. This is the image behind the process of introspection we are so familiar with.\nTwo things standout in this regard: (a) the higher I go in the structure, the more unique I am because I share less with other human beings; (b) my \u0026lsquo;uncontrollable\u0026rsquo; short temper is undoubtedly how \u0026lsquo;something\u0026rsquo; which I share with other human beings is expressing itself at the apex of such a structure. That is why I seem unable to do anything about it. Thus, the apex of the structure is at the same time an expression of my unique nature and also how something else, which is less unique (and therefore what I share with other human beings) is expressing itself. Then, my problem is with this structure itself: the way I am uniquely \u0026lsquo;I\u0026rsquo;. In short, my problem is precisely with what I take to be my uniqueness!\nThis argument appears as a form of reductio ad absurdum of the idea underlying the process of introspection which I have expressed in the form of imagery. On the one hand, I am driven to build and put great weight on the structure I have built because it expresses the unique nature of my being. On the other hand, it is precisely this unique structure that makes me so unhappy because it looks as though it is not \u0026lsquo;sufficiently\u0026rsquo; unique or unique enough. On the one hand, I aspire to be unique; on the other, no matter how much I try, I cannot be unique enough to earn that sobriquet. This makes my life a hell. It makes me unhappy. It makes it impossible for me to live with myself. Thus, I have no other choice except to commit suicide.\nHopefully, we can now understand why I said earlier on that the problem lies not in how I am but with how I think about myself: the problem lies not in my short temper but with introspection. It is this way of thinking that is creating the problem and not my being. If that is the case, is there another way to think about ourselves? Can we think about ourselves without introspecting?\nOur Indian traditions, with their psychological theory about human beings, and our practices (which still dominate village life) give an affirmative answer to these two almost synonymous questions: yes, there is. Let me sketch the outline of that answer (as I understand it today) using the same imagery I used before, namely, that of a foundation and a structure erected above it. And I will continue to use my short temper as an example.\nSuppose that I was born a hundred years ago in Bangalore or born in a village in the interior of Karnataka about 58 years ago. Let us suppose too that I had the same short temper and the same uncontrollable tongue. How would my social circle have looked at it and taught me to go-about with it? After umpteen attempts to help me control my short temper, my parents would have given up on me as well. However, in the course of this process, and as result of their failure, they would have also given me nick name: it could have either referred to the sage Durvasa or to Rudra. In any case, my entire family and my circle of friends would have known about this: Balu has short temper. But, they would have added, \u0026rsquo;this is how he is, but he means no harm and does not mean things he says when he loses his temper\u0026rsquo;. As I got socialized, I would also learn that \u0026rsquo;this is how I am\u0026rsquo; and that there is little I can do about it. As I grew old and acquired nieces and nephews, they too would know: their uncle is short tempered but is otherwise a sweet and lovable man. In short, both the social circle and I would have learnt to accept it as an idiosyncrasy of mine. In the same way someone has a nervous tic, some other person is afraid of spiders, Balu has short temper. My nick name would precede me and I would pay no high price for it. I would learn to live with it without being obsessed about it. My society and my culture would teach me that the structure that gets built on the foundation consists of such idiosyncrasies of people and not worth fretting about. Everyone is, in this sense, idiosyncratic and mine happens to be my short temper.\nNotice what has happened in this process. What the western culture teaches us as an expression of the unique nature of our beings is seen in India as nothing but a cluster of idiosyncrasies. One does not introspect about the latter but only regarding the former. The latter is almost inconsequential; the former constitutes the core of our being. This is one of the reasons why there is almost no introspective literature in India and hardly any deep autobiographies that analyze motives, desires and so on the way western autobiographies do.\nIn such a culture, what does thinking about oneself consist of then if it is not the same as introspection? If idiosyncrasies are not worth thinking about, what do we think about if we want to think about ourselves? The answer is obvious: you can only think about what you share with your fellow human beings (and perhaps even other organisms). That is, you think about the foundation. Reflection about oneself is to reflect about the nature of human beings. To the extent you are an exemplar of the human species, the knowledge you have of your \u0026lsquo;self\u0026rsquo; is the knowledge that you have of other human beings. If you are short tempered, greedy or whatever else, your reflections can only be about the nature of anger and the nature of greed. In short, as you go through life and to the extent you think about your \u0026lsquo;self\u0026rsquo;, you are thinking about fellow human beings and the psychology we all share. The further you push this reflection the more you understand human beings. The more you understand the latter, the more you understand your \u0026lsquo;self\u0026rsquo;.\nIn short, what the Indian culture transmits is this kind of self-reflection. It does not simply tell you that you \u0026lsquo;ought to\u0026rsquo; indulge in such reflections. But if you want to, there are multiple tried and tested ways to do this: the varied paths to \u0026rsquo;enlightenment\u0026rsquo; (in the Indian sense) are those tried and tested paths to \u0026ldquo;self-knowledge\u0026rdquo;. That is why this path does not pain you, does not harm you and does not make you unhappy. It is the route to happiness.\nFrom the contrast I am drawing, we can also distill some general guidelines regarding the difference between introspection on the one hand and reflection about ourselves on the other. When do we know when we are introspecting and when we are thinking about ourselves? Clearly, the objects of reflection are different: introspection focuses on the structure, self-knowledge focuses on the foundation. The manner of thinking is also different: introspection seeks to relate the layers of the structure to each other, whereas self-knowledge focuses on developing hypotheses to account for elements in the foundation. The experience of this thinking too is different: introspection generates pain (and such allied emotions); self-knowledge makes you happier. They also exhibit different kinds of movement: introspection generates a loop and you move without going anywhere and returning to the same point again and again; in self-knowledge there is progress because the nature of the problems changes with each solution you find. The experience you have of the movement is different as well: introspection sends you down a bottomless pit, whereas self-knowledge generates the sense of escape from a cage. Even the experience of your being is different: the more the introspection, the heavier you feel and more load you have to carry. In self-knowledge by contrast, there is a feeling of lightness because the load gets shed and each additional step becomes only the lighter for it. In short, there are two sets of criteria that you can develop: a cognitive set and an experiential set.\nThe reason why I have gone into this matter is this: the idea of \u0026ldquo;reflection on experience\u0026rdquo; makes sense only in relation to a way of thinking that is not introspection. Introspection does not make experience accessible at all; instead, it takes us away from experience. Introspection creates a self-sustaining loop and confines us to a place, where there is no experience at all but only an endless series of imaginary thoughts. The first step in learning to think about experience is to break free of the habit of introspection and desist reflecting on our own individual thoughts, individual feelings and individual sensations.\n","tags":[],"title":"Introspection vs. reflection on experience—S.N.Balagangadhara","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/introspection-vs-reflection-upon-experience-s-n-balagangadhara/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","Indian traditions"],"content":"Experiences are structured differently in different cultures. We believe that it is possible to give a true description of this difference, at some level or the other, asa difference regarding the experience of time itself. Consider the traditions of Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism.

As yet, it has no name. Better said, it has many names: from \u0026lsquo;reflexive\u0026rsquo; to the \u0026lsquo;post-modern\u0026rsquo;. The ferment is not widespread, but the voices of discontent are coherent and articulate. The critical voices indicate the many kinds of dissatisfaction they have with the status and nature of social sciences. Even though most dissenters cannot be grouped as representatives of any one tradition, many of their writings stand out above the rest. Two such authors are Wilhelm Halbfass and Ronald Inden; each has written a book that is worthy of attention and respect.\nIt is easy enough to identify the context that has brought forth the dissatisfaction of these two authors: the indological discourse and the manner in which Indian culture and civilization has been made into object of study and description over the centuries. Thematically, the ground for their restlessness is one of \u0026lsquo;representational inadequacy\u0026rsquo;: the extent to which accounts for other cultures capture the otherness of their object. As a theme, during the last decade or more, it has come into prominence in many fields and in many guises: in philosophy an attack against the notion of knowledge as a representation of the world has been remounted by Rorty; in anthropology it has taken the form that the anthropologist does not describe the other culture he meets with but writes some kind of psycho-biography instead. Whatever one\u0026rsquo;s stance with respect to these emerging disputes be, it does not take away the fact that, say, anthropological and Indological accounts are experienced as constituting some kind of problem.\nWhat kind of problem? In this critical notice, I will look at how Wilhelm Halbfass and Ronald Inden answer the above query. Each has sliced the theme along different axes: Halbfass focusses on the hermeneutic situation of inter cultural dialogue and titles his contribution, India and Europe: an Essay in Understanding; Inden, appropriately enough, opts for a more ambiguous Imagining India.\n1. Halbfass on India and Europe\nHalbfass\u0026rsquo; book consists of three parts: the first part deals with the historical growth of the multiple appreciations of Indian thought and culture in the West; the second part deals with the Indian thought and the way it has looked at other peoples and cultures; and a third part with appendices that treat some of the problems tackled in the first two sections. Each of these parts ends on a theoretical note, which reflects about what has been said: a \u0026lsquo;preliminary postscript\u0026rsquo; concludes the first part; an \u0026rsquo;epilogue\u0026rsquo; ends the second; \u0026lsquo;in lieu of a conclusion\u0026rsquo; sums up the appendices and the book as a whole. There are ample end notes to each of the chapters (totaling nearly 130 pages). The book is reasonably well written, crammed with many different kinds of information, thus enabling its use as a reference work as well.\nIn the ten chapters that constitute the first part of the book, we are provides with a general survey and overview of the prevalent pictures the West had of India till the twentieth century. The first chapter begins, appropriately enough, where western philosophy is supposed to have begun: with the Ancient Greeks. Through the early church fathers, the story is carried forward to the Islam encounter with India (chapter 2). The third chapter treats the constructions of the Christian missionaries.\nThe next chapters (till chapter 8 ) handle the history\u0026ndash;mostly German\u0026ndash;of the western understanding of India. The German Romantics, Hegel, Schelling and Schopenhauer, and the developments following them, each of these gets a chapter. The ninth chapter discusses the place accorded to India in histories of philosophy. The last chapter (#10), a preliminary postscript, deals with the hermeneutic situation in the twentieth century. Writing such histories is always a risky enterprise. Inevitably, one opens oneself up for charges of one-sidedness, incompleteness, and such like. To level such charges with respect to the first part of this book, however, is to completely miss both the project of the author as well as the work\u0026rsquo;s pioneering character. As far as I know, this is the first book-length attempt to provide us with an outline of the way European images of India have been built up over the centuries.\nThe above paragraph notwithstanding, I should nevertheless like to raise an issue of historical inadequacy which, in fact, touches on a core problem of Halbfass\u0026rsquo; project itself. As he himself notices (p.53), the Christian missionary literature has been extremely important in constructing the western images of India. Curiously enough though, a disproportionate amount of space is devoted in the third chapter to Roberto Nobili who played very little role in defining the western understanding of India. The Catholic Church was suspicious of Nobili, and his works hardly saw the light of the day. Roberto Nobili is an interesting figure, to be sure, but hardly of any significance to the actual dialogue as it took place between these two cultures. By contrast, Halbfass glosses over missionaries like Abrahamus Rogerius, Philippus Baldaeus, etc., who were extremely important in outlining precisely the contours of understanding and dialogue that Halbfass is interested in. It is almost as though two different questions and two different concerns are constantly interfering with each other. There is the first set which Halbfass constantly grapples with: who are the best exemplars of the hermeneutic situation of inter-cultural dialogue? Which figures exemplify best the tension inherent in the attempts at cross-cultural understanding? And, then, there is also the second group of questions which actually sets the context for the above questions. How shall we choose our best exemplars?\nOne choice is to look for those who were most sensitive to the problems generated by the contact and dialogue between India and the West. More likely than not, such figures have also been utterly marginal to the actual hermeneutic process; they have been unable to determine the terms of the dialogue. Furthermore, the contemporary situation from where we identify hermeneutic questions is itself the result of the hermeneutic understanding as it evolved. Consequently, the second is to opt for those figures who have effectively shaped such a dialogue. These alternatives are not a mere speculative enumeration of possibilities. They have altogether different consequences to Halbfass\u0026rsquo; project if it turns out that there is a hiatus between, on the one hand, the dialogue as it took place and the marginal figures who raised sensitive hermeneutic questions on the other.\nTo see what this remark means, consider another genre of writings\u0026ndash;the travel accounts published between the sixteenth and the eighteenth centuries in Europe. For example, the writings of Varthema, a Portugese exploer, were immensely popular in the West and it is such writings that tell us what the hermeneutic situation was like. The early missionaries, the philosophers of the enlightenment, all and sundry in fact were brought up on such tales and accounts. When a Herder or a Hegel speaks of the culture of India, when they attempt to understand translations of fragmentary texts, their horizon of understanding was determined in very important ways by what explorers had written about India. Yet, Halbfass hardly mentions the travel literature. This is not a mere side comment on the bibliographical inadequacy of India and Europe. Rather it points to a fundamental lacuna, which can be formulated in very simple terms. Halbfass seems to pay no attention to the contexts of dialogue. By this I do not refer to such events as colonization and so forth, but to those that fundamentally defined the very nature of the dialogue itself. When Christian missionaries from the seventeenth century Europe described Indian religions and philosophies, they were working within Christianity. When the enlightenment philosophers looked at other cultures and peoples, they were doing so within the ambit of Protestant criticisms of Catholic Christianity. To even think of abstracting from this context (because of the excuse that one is not giving an \u0026ldquo;exhaustive\u0026rdquo; history of the encounter between India and Europe) is to fundamentally misconceive the dialogue itself. One example ought to suffice.\nHalbfass uses the term \u0026lsquo;fulfillment\u0026rsquo; to describe the attitude of the nineteenth century missionaries in India who looked at Christianity as the fullest and most complete religion and believed that the religious needs and feelings of people are fulfilled only in Christianity. About this orientation, he says\nWe may even suspect that the development of the idea of fulfillment among the Christian missionaries is, in part at least, a response to the Neo-Hindu inclusivism as we find it exemplified by Ramakrishna, Keshab Chandra Sen and Vivekanda ( p.52).\nDespite the qualifications (\u0026lsquo;we may even suspect\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;in part at least\u0026rsquo;) that rob this formulation of much of its worth, surely, this is untrue. The idea of \u0026lsquo;fulfillment\u0026rsquo; is as old as Christianity itself. It is a part of Christian self-understanding that Jesus is Christ and that in him alone does God reveal Himself fully and completely. (Some modern-day Christian philosophers of religion and theologians are less inclined to subscribe to this remark of course.) In fact, Eusebius, some of whose writings Halbfass seems to be acquainted with summarized the understanding prevalent during his time ( 300 years after Christ) in his famous Evangelical Preparations, where he sees the Ancient Greek and Roman Culture as preparations for the advent of Gospels. Two hundred or so years later, St. Augustine (in his De Vera Religione) argues that all heathen religions were fulfilled by the coming of Christ in flesh; and so forth. The missionaries (both Protestant and Catholic) after the reformation schism never made any bones about this theological issue. In this sense, to attribute an absolutely essential part of Christian self-understanding to a response to the \u0026lsquo;inclusivism\u0026rsquo; of Neo-Hinduism is to live in a no-man\u0026rsquo;s land. Clearly, Halbfass pays no attention to the fact that these missionaries were Christian and were looking at India through the lens of their religion as they received it from their milieu. As a consequence, Halbfass cannot but misread both what the missionaries were saying, what \u0026lsquo;Neo-Hinduism\u0026rsquo; is about, and what the nature of their dialogue was. Thus a big question opens up: which dialogue is Halbfass describing? How could we continue a dialogue if we are oblivious to its very terms?\nTraditional Hinduism has not reached out for the West. It has not been driven by \u0026hellip; the urge to understand and master the foreign cultures. \u0026hellip; India has discovered the West and begun to respond to it in being sought out, explored, overrun and objectified by it. \u0026hellip; Europeans took the intiative. They went to India. This is a simple and familiar fact. Yet its fundamental significance for the hermeneutics of the encounter between India and the West is often forgotten. (p.172; see also p.437)\nThus begins the eleventh chapter (and the second part) of Halbfass\u0026rsquo; chronicle of Indian \u0026ldquo;xenology\u0026rdquo;. ( A term that Halbfass borrows from Duala-M\u0026rsquo;bedy to pick out the attitudes towards and conceptualizations of foreigners; p.507. n2.) In this part, Halbfass is interested in finding out what Indian \u0026ldquo;xenology\u0026rdquo; has been like. There is obviously not much of an interest in the \u0026lsquo;other\u0026rsquo; in the traditional Indian thought. Halbfass believes that \u0026ldquo;the lack of xenological interest and initiative in traditional Hinduism is obviously connected with its lack of historical interest and motivation\u0026rdquo; ( p.196). The next chapter is about Rammohan Roy (a Bengali reformer). We read there that Roy was deeply influenced by the European thought: \u0026ldquo;The mark of European thought may be seen in his program of a return to the purity of the original sources, his universalism, his concept of God, his style of Interpretation, etc.\u0026rdquo; (p. 207). What was his contribution to the dialogic encounter? Here is Halbfass\u0026rsquo; answer, one of those typical passages that abound throughout the book:\nRammohan\u0026rsquo;s contribution to the encounter between India and Europe is not to be found in any teachings about the relationship between the two, nor in any theoretical model of cross-cultural or interreligious understanding. The essence of his contribution lies instead in the variety and interplay of his means of expression, in the rupture and tension in his hermeneutic orientation, in his practice of responding and appealing to different traditions and horizons of expectation, and in the exemplary openness and determination with which he avails himself of the historical situation and its hermeneutical opportunities (p.208).\nIt is worth our while to pause and look at the above passage and its message. Roy\u0026rsquo;s contribution was not theoretical in the sense of providing a theory (or a model) of cross-cultural or interreligious understanding; it was not empirical in the sense that he discovered something hitherto unknown in either India or the West. His contribution lies in the way he used some parts of a language (\u0026ldquo;in the variety and interplay of his means of expression\u0026rdquo;); in the fact of what he was\u0026ndash;a Europeanized Indian Christian (\u0026ldquo;in the rupture and tension in his hermeneutic orientation\u0026rdquo;). Because of this, he had to appeal to what he knew of both these traditions (\u0026ldquo;his practice of responding and appealing to different traditions and horizons of expectation\u0026rdquo;), and in doing so, he was quite an unprincipled opportunist (\u0026ldquo;the exemplary openness and the determination with which he avails of the historical situation and its hermeneutical opportunities\u0026rdquo;). In other words, Rammohan Roy had nothing interesting to say and his importance to the Indians (or Hinduism) is the fact that he is an Indian. If this is it, why not simply say so? Is it a fear of hurting Indian readers? or simply a reflection of the \u0026rsquo;tension and rupture\u0026rsquo; in Halbfass\u0026rsquo; own hermeneutic orientation? Whatever the reason, I can only note that such paragraphs hardly help an interested reader.\nThe next chapter (#13) about Neo-Hinduism is followed by five subsequent chapters (#15 to #19) which are of narrowly Indological interest. They discuss the notion of Dharma, philosophy and such like in the Indian literature. Here, Halbfass is at his best revealing a masterly grasp of relevant texts. Extended discussion of these chapters will not be of great interest to the readers of this journal and, personally speaking, I am skeptical too of the results that this kind of Indological research can possibly deliver. A short epilogue concludes the second part of the book.\nThe third part consists of a series of appendices: one on the concept of experience, the other is the author\u0026rsquo;s debate with Hacker on the concept of \u0026lsquo;inclusivism\u0026rsquo;, and ends in a chapter that should be seen \u0026lsquo;In lieu of a conclusion\u0026rsquo;.\nBy now it must be evident that Halbfass has written a rich and complex book. It is a difficult book to evaluate, partly because it is not obvious to me what his central thesis is or whether he has any. Neither thematically not chronologically is it a unified book. While reading the book, I often had the feeling that Halbfass has identified some interesting problems, has developed insights that are immensely important but is unable (or unwilling) to elaborate them in any systematic way. Perhaps, one reason is his adopted \u0026lsquo;philosophical\u0026rsquo; style: a peculiar combination of hermeneutics with a typically German idea of what it is to \u0026rsquo;think through\u0026rsquo;. In fact, one of the irritating aspects of this book is its tendency to raise multiple questions without trying to answer any of them. There is a world of difference between simply formulating questions by their hundreds and solving problems. It is the latter which helps us understand more about the world, and the former has merely a nuisance value when raised without answers or even hints of one. Here are two characteristic passages (there are many such in this book, e.g. 161, 163, 169, 260-261, 262, 379-380, 401-402, 419, 439-440) that typify what I am talking about.\nIs Hegel\u0026rsquo;s scheme of historical subordination and his association of the idea of philosophy with the historical identity and destiny of Europe entirely obsolete? Does it reflect the attitude of his own time and the earlier history of European interest in India? To what extent has it influenced its subsequent development? Has it finally been superseded by the progress of Indian and \u0026ldquo;Oriental\u0026rdquo; studies and by the results of objective historical research? But to what extent is such research itself a European phenomenon and part of European self-affirmation? To what extent does it reflect European perspectives and motivations? How, on the other hand, has the encounter with India, the accumulation of information about it, affected the European self-understanding and sense of identity? Has it affected the meaning of religion and philosophy itself? How and why did Europeans become interested in Indian thought? Which questions and expectations did they have concerning India and themselves? How much \u0026ldquo;search\u0026rdquo; for \u0026ldquo;Indian wisdom\u0026rdquo; has there been, and what is its significance? (p.2; see also 374-375)\nIn a very trivial sense, you will be able to answer these questions at the end of Halbfass\u0026rsquo; book; but then, in exactly the same sense, you would have been able to answer them before reading the book as well. Consider now the second characteristic passage.\nIs there a philosophy today which is nourished by an equal, and equally committed, familiarity with Indian and European sources? Has the encounter between India and Europe, and the \u0026ldquo;comparison\u0026rdquo; of Indian and European philosophies, opened new prospects for philosophy itself? To what extent have we gone beyond the projection of speculative images of India on the one hand, and the accumulation of historical and philological information on the other? To what extent have the Indians gone beyond apologetics, reinterpretation, and the combination and interplay of Indian and European concepts? Will Indian and European thought come together in a \u0026ldquo;truly cosmopolitan world-philosophy\u0026rdquo; Will there ever be a \u0026ldquo;global philosophy\u0026rdquo; and a genuine \u0026ldquo;fusion of horizons\u0026rdquo;, i.e. a new context of orientation and self-understanding which would be fundamentally different from what Troeltsch called \u0026ldquo;bookbinder\u0026rsquo;s synthesis\u0026rdquo; or from a merely additive accumulation of data about foreign traditions, and a non-committal recognition and \u0026ldquo;understanding\u0026rdquo; of alternative world-views? In what sense can the dialogue between India and Europe affect our way of asking fundamental questions, as well as our reflection upon the meaning and limits of philosophy itself? Is there hope for a philosophically significant \u0026ldquo;comparative philosophy\u0026rdquo; which would imply the freedom to transcend philosophy in its European sense? (p.375)\nThese are, let us note well, important questions. But how shall we go about answering them? Even more importantly, what would count as answers to these questions? Halbfass\u0026rsquo; own reflections on the above paragraph take the following form:\nThese questions remain open. The temptation to answer and discard questions of this nature by presenting general and programmatic declarations has itself contributed greatly to the abstract rhetoric which continues to dominate wide areas of \u0026ldquo;comparative philosophy\u0026rdquo; (ibid).\nWill, I wonder, Professor Halbfass understand and forgive me if I raise a rhetorical query or two myself? To what extent are these questions like those raised by Professor Halbfass themselves contributive to making what \u0026ldquo;comparative philosophy\u0026rdquo; has become? Is there a way we can fruitfully conduct serious enquiries without being tempted to appear prematurely profound? Is there hope for a serious cross-cultural theory which avoids the extremes of mimetic reproduction of hackneyed themes or a rehash of famed vulgarities? Your guess in answering these queries, I am inclined to say, is as good as mine.\nPolemics aside, let me note that my criticism of Halbfass is not that he has failed to answer all or any of these questions. But we need to know what would count as an answer and what is required in answering these questions. Of course, more theoretical and empirical work is all that is needed in answering this or any other question about the world we live in. But surely, we need to go beyond this trivial truth after having read a book about the dialogue between India and Europe.\n\u0026ldquo;Modern Indian thought\u0026rdquo;, says Halbfass continuing, \u0026ldquo;finds itself in a historical context created by Europe, and it has difficulties speaking for itself. Even in its self-representation and self-assertion, it speaks to a large extent in a European Idiom\u0026rdquo; (ibid). Without a doubt, a fundamental and true insight; but what is its import? This is true not merely for India but also for all non-western cultures. Our problem is to find out how this insight could be put to work in a creative and productive fashion. Until such a stage is reached, repetition of this insight will be so much flag waving. Surely, this situation has not come into being because we speak a European language or that sufficiently intelligent people do not exist in India or elsewhere. What, then, has made the Indians understand themselves in terms of the European understanding of their culture? Ronald Inden, in his book about Imagining India, tries to obliquely answer this question.\n2. Inden on Imagining India**\nAs one of the interpretations of the title is suggestive of, Inden concentrates on the way Europe has imaginatively pictured India. The three interdependent theses he argues for, however, have a broader scope than the Asian subcontinent alone. To begin with, Inden argues that a particular kind of metaphysic has had the historical consequence of producing false descriptions of India which parade as Indological knowledge. Furthermore, this metaphysic is not uniquely present in Indology alone but has a wider acceptance among social scientists. Secondly, embracing an alternative metaphysics is required if one intends to do more than merely exercise one\u0026rsquo;s imagination while indulging in a study of peoples and their ways of living. He argues for this thesis by drawing upon Collingwood and by trying to redescribe the ubiquitous \u0026lsquo;caste\u0026rsquo; system and state. Thirdly, there is the broader thesis that the image Europe has of itself is tightly connected to the image it has of the other, in this case, India. Of necessity, the second and the third theses are less elaborated than the first.\nWith the exception of the first and the last chapter, the bulk of the book concentrates on spelling out both the metaphysic that has supported the European understanding of India and the several landmarks that characterize this description. Each one of them is accorded a treatment in an independent chapter: the caste system (#2); Hinduism (#3); the village India (#4); and oriental despotism (#5). These chapters are to illustrate the contention that a particular metaphysic underlies Indological practice. Put in extremely simple terms, this metaphysic displaces human agency to supra- or trans-historical essences. In more elaborate terms, the characteristic properties attributed to the social world by this metaphysic are the following:\nIt is objective. It exists as its apart from any knowledge of it and does not differ with the interests or perspectives of those who know about it.\nIt is necessarily unified. All its parts operate together toward the same goal or in accord with the same design\nIt is bounded, in that it is isolable from any other systems that can be known apart from them.\nIt is atomist and consists ultimately of fundamental units that are the smallest, irreducible entities in it, to wit atoms in physics, individuals in the social world.\nIt is complete; any diminution of its parts would impair its working; any addition would be redundant.\nIt is self-centered, that is, it has a directing centre and a directed periphery.\nIt is self-regulating; it operates automatically, apart from the original and perhaps occasional intervention of a Prime Mover, equatable with the guiding mind of this giant body.\nIt is determinist. Its parts follow universal laws; events in it are discrete, each cause having a definite effect, which is to say that the future is determined by the past.\nIt is essentialist. The phenomena that make up the world are manifestations of \u0026rsquo;essences\u0026rsquo;, objective determinate entities that underlie their \u0026lsquo;surface\u0026rsquo; features or appearances, e.g., \u0026lsquo;sovereignty is the essence of state\u0026rsquo; (p.13).\nInden\u0026rsquo;s fire, then, is directed against all social scientific thinking that is guided by this metaphysic. His aim is to demonstrate that Indological discourse is indeed imprisoned by this way of thinking.\nHas Inden succeeded in showing this? The answer to this question is not simple, unfortunately. It depends on very much on what is count as evidence for these claims. That is not all. The relationship between this metaphysic and the Indological descriptions is not a simple relation of a premise to its consequence either. As Inden puts it: \u0026ldquo;I shall be concerned to bring out the presuppositions that silently inhabit their (the European scholars of South Asia in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries) words and thoughts and the consequences that attend them\u0026rdquo; (p.11). What kinds of consequences are these? The footnote formulates it thus: \u0026ldquo;I distinguish consequence here as a historical problem from entailments in a formal, logical sense\u0026rdquo; (ibid; fn.5). If I understand Inden correctly, he is suggesting that the Indologists have often made assumptions characteristic of a certain kind of metaphysic and that, as a historical fact, some peculiar problems have come to the fore. What relation is there between these assumptions and the problems that have emerged in the Indological research of the last two hundred years? In the rest of the book, a dependency relation is posited between the two without being clear, however, about what that relation is. As I shall be returning to this point later on, let me suggest that the best strategy to evaluate the success of Inden\u0026rsquo;s enterprise is to look at one or two chapters closely. That I shall do by looking at the second chapter (caste) here, while glancing at the third chapter (Hinduism) towards the end.\nCaste system in India\nInden introduces the theme by speaking about the problem that has fascinated many. China, the other greatest civilization that dominates Asia, was never really colonized; India, by contrast, has often been.\nWhat differentiated India, then, from China and the Near East was this paradoxical fact: outsiders, beginning with the Aryans and ending with the British had conquered India again and again, but her ancient civilization had survived into the present more or less unchanged. \u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip; What in the nature of this civilization could possibly explain this seeming paradox? The answer discourses on India have given \u0026hellip; has been \u0026lsquo;Caste\u0026rsquo;, that institution considered peculiar to India, and particularly to India\u0026rsquo;s distinctive religion, Hinduism ( p.55-56)\nOf course, this problem arises only if India is seen as an \u0026lsquo;unchanging\u0026rsquo; civilization. But then, as Inden points out, this image of static India was as such a part of the Indological discourse as was the solution provided to answer the alleged paradox.\nThis solution knows at least two dominant variants, as Inden tells the story. There is, firstly, \u0026rsquo;the empiricist\u0026rsquo; theorizing about the origin of this institution; secondly, there is the \u0026lsquo;idealist\u0026rsquo; speculation about its emergence. Rejecting the story about the cosmogenic creation of four groups (from the brahmin to the sudra) as an explanation for the genesis of \u0026lsquo;Caste\u0026rsquo; in India, the empiricists (which counts mostly the British colonial administrators, utilitarian thinkers like James Mill, and so on) went in search of a possible mechanism that could account for its origin. One of the favored hypothesis was the interaction and intermingling of races\u0026ndash;the Aryan with the native, the Dravidian. To the idealists, the cosmogonic story about the birth of four varnas constitutes the fundamental explanation of what \u0026lsquo;caste\u0026rsquo; is. Inden also sketches the ideas of some dissenting voices: from Hocart through Weber to Dumont. \u0026ldquo;Nearly all, however, have continued to look on their version of caste as a post-tribal society of \u0026rsquo;natural\u0026rsquo; ties that constitutes the distinctive essence of India\u0026rdquo; (p.83).\nMore or less among similar lines, by referring to appropriate authors, Inden provides a critical look at the other pillars that constitute the other pillars of the Indological discourse: the belief that understanding Hinduism is to grasp the nature of the Hindu mind (chapter #3); that the essence of India is in her villages (chapter #4); and that the oriental despot provided the key to understanding her political structure (chapter #5). In the last chapter, Inden attempts at a reconstruction of \u0026lsquo;medieval India\u0026rsquo; by using the philosophical resources adumbrated in the first chapter.\nIn my assessment, his last chapter is by far the best in the book; the first chapter, the worst. For the purposes of this discussion, however, I will ignore both: the last chapter because Inden\u0026rsquo;s reconstruction is in a preliminary phase and we should all wait and see what kind of a theory will come out before indulging in an assessment; the first chapter because it is counter-productive to have a philosophical fight at this stage.\nHow could a debate about philosophical presuppositions be counter-productive when the meat of Inden\u0026rsquo;s book\u0026ndash;and his message\u0026ndash;is precisely about the need for examining the metaphysic of social scientific discourse? How, furthermore, could Inden write such an important and exciting book while giving himself over to excavating and discussing philosophical assumptions of Indological discourse?\nInden\u0026rsquo;s Critique of Caste\nReconsider the two dominant theories prevalent in the Indological discourses as Inden outlines them: a racialist theory and the idealistic one. Both attempt to explain the origin of Caste by assuming its antiquity. Apart from their cognitive inadequacies as explanations of social phenomena, their status as theories get discredited if it turns out that what they explain never existed i.e., if Caste does not have such an antiquity at all. Inden, in fact, states asmuch by referring to his early work on the Bengali kinship:\n(T)he distinctive institution of Indian civilization does not appear until the thirteenth or fourteenth century, at the earliest; and castes are not the cause of the weakness and collapse of Hindu kingship, but the effect of it. (p.82)\nSuch a discussion about objective-level accounts is both productive and important. But Inden wants to push the discussion one step further and go to the \u0026lsquo;roots\u0026rsquo; of these images themselves. Such would be possible, if these images have some one foundation. My suggestion is that they do not.\nTo appreciate this suggestion better, consider the fact that the Indologist discourse over the last few hundred years does entertain the image of Caste-dominated India. How has this image sustained itself? Why is there such a wide-spread acceptance of this \u0026lsquo;datum\u0026rsquo; among intellectuals? Here is one way to account for this state of affairs. Thinkers from succeeding generations have read either books or have read/heard in the media that Caste is a non-dynamic social fossil, or whatever. Some among them treat this as a fact requiring explanation, build their theories to do so; subsequent generations look at the earlier, unsuccessful theories and try to improve upon them, and so on. Thus, over a period of time, a commonsense claim crystallizes as a fact\u0026ndash;now it is also a fact of these theories.\nThis possibility shall definitely have occurred to Inden and, perhaps, he rejects it because it is too banal. He tries to look for a \u0026lsquo;deeper\u0026rsquo; explanation and finds it in the \u0026lsquo;metaphysics of essences\u0026rsquo;. However, this is no explanation at all, deeper or otherwise. Why not?\nFirst, an empirical example. Marcus Olson jr. wrote a book a few years ago titled The Rise and Decline of Nations (Yale University Press, 1982). He is neither an anthropologist nor an Indologist, appeals to the writings of Nehru among other things, but one of his problems too is: how to account for the social fossil that Caste is supposed to be? Nehru, as Inden argues, may have been a prisoner of the metaphysics of essences; Olson, by no stretch of imagination, is. Olson\u0026rsquo;s explanandum happens to be Nehru\u0026rsquo;s fact as well as the Indologists\u0026rsquo;s characteristic description. Olson merely takes it as a problem requiring a solution without enquiring into the process of how it was made into a problem. In fact, Olson even believes that the power of his theory could be measured by the number of problems it solves including the unsolved problem of explaining Caste. So do the sociobiologically oriented sociologists like Pierre van de Berghe (The Ethnic Phenomena, Elsevier, 1981), for instance. Individuals active in one field of social science take over \u0026lsquo;problems\u0026rsquo; (which might later turn out to be pseudo-problems) and \u0026lsquo;facts\u0026rsquo; from their colleagues active in other domains whenever they believe they have built a theory which can successfully solve a number of problems hitherto unsolved.\nThe forced reconstruction of Indology as a prisoner of a particular metaphysic can succeed in the face of such empirical examples and practices only if it is the case that taking over a fact or a problem also entails taking over the metaphysic. That is to say, if the relation between a theory about some phenomena both entails and is entailed by a specific metaphysic. Can such a claim be made today?\nAt first sight, it appears as though there is a very tight relationship between how we describe the world and what we take to be present in the world. Someone who believes that the world is made up of spirits is not likely to come up with the relativity theory, of course. While true, it does not tell us what kind of a theory such a person is likely to come up with either. Maximally, when alternative theories and ontologies are present and known to us, we can anticipate some kinds of impossibilities regarding a description of the world that such a person could provide. More generally put, we do not have a great deal of clarity about the nature of the relationship between meta-theoretical assumptions and theories about objects in the world. We do believe that our philosophies have a heuristic function with respect to developing scientific theories. But more than that is very difficult to maintain today.\nThe empirical history of natural sciences, as well as the plurality of the philosophies of sciences, are the best examples of our problem. Surely, it cannot be held that each practitioner of different scientific theories over the last three hundred years or more entertained the same meta-theoretical assumptions. If anything is knowledge at all, theories in natural sciences are that. Their growth and development itself constitutes a philosophical problem\u0026ndash;subject to different meta-scientific treatments ranging from inductivist arguments to problem solving accounts.\nThe first reason why Inden\u0026rsquo;s diagnosis fails to be convincing is this: Why should either Indology or human sciences be any different in this regard?\nClose on the heels of this question comes the second. Assume, counterfactually, that Inden\u0026rsquo;s portrayal of Indological accounts is acceptable. That is to say, Inden is able to show us textually\u0026ndash;something which, in his book, often turns around whether or not same author uses the word \u0026rsquo;essentially\u0026rsquo;, as thought this betrays a commitment to \u0026rsquo;essences\u0026rsquo;\u0026ndash;that he can make interpretative sense of these authors by using certain philosophical assumptions. What does this demonstrate? Not that Indologists have entertained certain beliefs about the world but that Inden\u0026rsquo;s proposals appear to be heuristically powerful. We can test Inden\u0026rsquo;s claim about Indology by deriving (in some suitably diluted sense of the word) the Indological \u0026rsquo;theories\u0026rsquo; from the assumptions.\nIn other words, Inden\u0026rsquo;s proposal could only be convincing if we have some kind of a theory which tell us what the relationship between our meta-theoretical commitments and our descriptions of the world. None has such a theory today. In its absence, to lay even a part of the blame at the doorstep of a set of philosophical assumptions can hardly convince. It is a gratuitous act.\nNeither empirically nor theoretically could one argue that embracing some metaphysic or the other has necessary repercussions on object-level theories about some aspect of the world. A group could hold on to one theory and yet differ in metaphysical commitments (e.g. quantum physicists); a group could hold on to different theories and yet subscribe to one and the same metaphysic (Inden accepts this claim). That is why I find philosophical discussions at this stage (when we have no serious theories in the field) a waste of time.\nConsider the same issue from another angle, which Inden himself suggests. He claims that the social scientific discourse is a prisoner of the metaphysic he identifies. Let us accept this claim at its face-value. In what does the identity and unity of Indological, as distinct from the social scientific, discourse consist of? Because the same metaphysic is operative elsewhere, the specificity of the Indological discourse lies in the object of its study, viz., India. In that case, why is there a positive description of the West and a negative one of India? One cannot lay blame on philosophical assumptions\u0026ndash;they are the same in the social sciences as a whole. Consequently, the blame can only be laid on the individual practitioners of Indology: they were racist, prejudiced, biased, \u0026hellip; While this is one way of holding these practitioners responsible, Inden wants to hear nothing of such judgments, as he repeatedly makes clear:\nThroughout his book I have argued that the problem with orientalism is not just one of bias or bad motives, hence, confined to itself (p. 264).\nWhat is the second possibility? The Indologists were not individually prejudiced or racist but, as a group, they were expressions of the bourgeois imperialist class interests. They were \u0026lsquo;objectively\u0026rsquo; serving the interests of the imperialist powers. This possibility too is rejected by Inden. (Even though, let it be noted, he himself leans toward such an explanation albeit covering it up with the talk of \u0026lsquo;knowledge formations\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;hegemonic intellectuals\u0026rsquo; and their texts)\nThis third possibility is to locate the biased and prejudiced descriptions in the Indologist\u0026rsquo;s desire to discover \u0026lsquo;otherness\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;alienness\u0026rsquo; in Indian culture. That may well be true; but the question remains: why did they speak of otherness in the manner they did?\nInden\u0026rsquo;s answer, as I read his book, is simplistic. It had to do with the dominant metaphors in terms of which the West understood itself. The western intellectuals perceived their culture as exemplifying a male with a world-ordering rationality contrasted to which stood the \u0026lsquo;other\u0026rsquo; as negation. It is, of course, difficult to demonstrate that all these intellectuals did really think of both themselves and others in terms of these metaphors. Be it as that may, there are two distinct issues here. First: Inden is right in suggesting that the kind of \u0026lsquo;otherness\u0026rsquo; which one can conceive of depends on how the \u0026lsquo;self\u0026rsquo; itself has been conceived. The second issue is where to localize the terms of self-description. My claim is that one has to look at object-level theories. Neither their \u0026lsquo;underlying\u0026rsquo; metaphysic, nor even these metaphors help us much.\nThe reason for this is not far to seek. The relation between theories and metaphors is not a one-way traffic. Metaphors have proved to be powerful heuristics in the process of producing and popularizing theories. But the expressive abilities of metaphors depend on what kind of theories we have at our disposal as well. From a commonsense point of view today, \u0026lsquo;order\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;chaos\u0026rsquo; might appear as two poles of a description, but you would not think so any more if you knew the theory of Fractals. Consequently, to judge whether \u0026lsquo;world-ordering rationality\u0026rsquo; is responsible for the description of the Indian culture as a \u0026lsquo;female irrationality\u0026rsquo;, we first need to look at object-level theories held by the practitioners during that period. How the West looked at caste system is parasitic upon its ideas of what social groups were; how its intellectuals treated Hinduism will be non-trivially dependent on what religion was to them; etc.\nIs Inden doing the same? Yes and no. The \u0026lsquo;yes\u0026rsquo; is evident, but the \u0026rsquo;no\u0026rsquo; is more important: he criticizes some alleged \u0026lsquo;common\u0026rsquo; metaphysical presuppositions instead of focusing on object-level constructions. The commonality in the West\u0026rsquo;s multiple descriptions of India cannot be shown by some fancy footwork. It requires nothing less than building a theory about the western culture itself and a tendentious hermeneutic exercise is no substitute for it.\n3. Halbfass and Inden: About Limitations\nWhile discussing Halbfass\u0026rsquo; book, I made the point that he appears oblivious to the cultural nature of the hermeneutic encounter between India and Europe. To show how and in what sense such a dialogue is cultural, we need theories about cultures which give us insights into the nature of cultural differences. In Inden\u0026rsquo;s account too, this sensitivity to cultural difference is missing. Like Halbfass, he too is aware that the Indian intellectuals have mostly taken over as their self-description those that the West has provided (p.38). His answer to this puzzle, one supposes, is that Indians have taken over the metaphysic of their western counterparts. No doubt, colonialism (in one way or another) would be a very important part of an explanation. But the very idea that cultural differences could be a part of the explanans appear inadmissible to Inden (cf. p. 263).\nFrom any point of view, this is extraordinary. We have two books on our hands that focus on the contact between two cultures and talk about the images that one culture has built up of the other. But they are either oblivious to (Halbfass) or dismissive of (Inden) the possibility that it could have much to do with the cultural differences between India and the West.\nI cannot hope to argue for this point in any detail here; but it may be worthwhile to register here that I have begin constructing such a description which does not trivialize the nature of cultural differences. (The Heathen in his blindness: Asia, the West and the dynamic of religion, 1994.) What I can do, however, is to indicate what it means to ask for what I am asking by looking very briefly at Inden\u0026rsquo;s treatment of Hinduism.\nInden on Hinduism\nIn the process of understanding India, the European savants went in search of a religion that underlay its social organization. In this process, they \u0026lsquo;constituted Hinduism\u0026rsquo; (p.89), broke it into elements and mapped it onto three groups in the Indian society: \u0026lsquo;Brahmanism\u0026rsquo;, the religion of the \u0026lsquo;priests\u0026rsquo;, viz., the brahmins; the \u0026lsquo;popular\u0026rsquo; Hinduism, which expressed the piety of the laity, and a crude, animistic religion meant for the illiterate. Inden chronicles the \u0026lsquo;history\u0026rsquo; of this Hinduism as it was penned by the European scholars. A sectarian phase of excesses, during which period there was a decline and degeneration of Hinduism.\nAs Inden tells the story, the Europeans did not merely look for the religion of another culture. They also looked for another religion\u0026ndash;an \u0026lsquo;other\u0026rsquo; from their own\u0026ndash;that could explain the alienness of Indian culture. The contrast set to the male \u0026lsquo;world-ordering rationality\u0026rsquo; ( p.86) of the European culture, says Inden, was found in the essentially feminine, sponge-like, amorphous entity that Hinduism was.\nMill\u0026rsquo;s chapter on the religion of Hindus\u0026ndash;in his History\u0026ndash;and the Wilson\u0026rsquo;s Indological comments on it provide the framework for the orientalist discourse. What is that framework? It is actually a combination of two things: an explanation about the origin of religion (viz. the transformation of natural forces into divine entities) coupled with a pejorative description of Hinduism. This combination does create a problem: if religion is an explanatory attempt (the so-called intellectualist description of religion), how to understand the absence of any coherent system of belief in Hinduism? The answer to this question, says Inden, was provided by the German Romantics and Hegel.\nThat answer had to do with combining the development of religion with \u0026lsquo;faculty\u0026rsquo; psychology: religious consciousness grows from an inferior form of reason to its explicit articulation in reason proper. As a natural religion, Hinduism was a product of imagination; the latter itself\u0026ndash;as a faculty of human psyche\u0026ndash;was under the sway of emotions. Inden detects the \u0026lsquo;multi-layered\u0026rsquo; picture of soul in contemporary authors like Levi-Strauss and in those many studies of myth as well (p. 96).\nIn the subsequent pages, Inden tries to show how the European descriptions of Brahamnism, \u0026lsquo;popular\u0026rsquo; Hinduism, and the animistic religion of the illiterate are accommodated within the framework of Mill. Brahmanism appeared, as the Europeans described it, to have a double essence:\nIn the first instance, it is an over-elaborated cosmic ritualism; in the final instance, it is a radical idealism or mysticism. There is not the orderly world made by King Reason and his Prime Minister Will. It is the disordered, extreme world conjured by the mistress of the senses, Imagination ( p.104).\n\u0026lsquo;Popular\u0026rsquo; Hinduism, appropriately enough, grows from the more elite religion. Concomitantly, it focuses the piety of the laity by using icons, images and such like. In one version, Brahmins catered to the superstitious masses; in another, they popularized their own \u0026lsquo;creeds\u0026rsquo; to meet the religious needs of the masses (p. 112). As the Indological research progressed and knowledge about India accumulated, a third religion was revealed to exist beneath the earlier two: a sacrificial and animistic cult seen severally as a \u0026rsquo;native\u0026rsquo; religion of the Dravidians which shaped Hinduism or as an archaic survival.\nIn the subsequent part, Inden looks at several authors from Jung to Sudhir Kakar, who have taken over the notion of an essentially feminine Hindu mind.\nOn Inden\u0026rsquo;s Critique\nTo know the religion of the Hindus, it was and is still believed, is to grasp the nature ( or mind ) of their civilization. This belief, however, has no special relationship with either \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; or any \u0026lsquo;world-ordering rationality\u0026rsquo;. Rather, it is part of a much more pervasive, deeply rooted idea (which, nota bene, Inden shares as well) that religion is a constitutive element of human cultures. This assumption has a history of at least two thousand years in the West\u0026ndash;and it partially constitutes the West as a culture. Not merely does this belief about religion make the West into a culture, but the latter\u0026rsquo;s constitution as a culture is itself a history of what religion is to this culture.\nNeither James Mill\u0026rsquo;s treatment of Hinduism, nor the so-called intellectualist explanation of the same, nor even the historian Spear\u0026rsquo;s portrayal of Hinduism as \u0026lsquo;an amorphous entity\u0026rsquo;\u0026ndash;none of these is a characteristic description of either Hinduism or the female that Indian culture is supposed to be.\nFor a nearly two hundred and fifty years (from Herbert of Cherbury to Freud), the question of the origin of religion was a hotly debated issue in the West. What a Spear or a Mill said about Hinduism was said long ago by others of paganism and heathendom. Mill, contra Inden (p. 70), set neither the terms nor provide the framework of presuppositions for describing the nature of the Hindu religion. He himself inherited all of these from the debates about the nature of religion. As long as we do not understand why the issue of the origin of religion was important to this culture and what its importance was, we are simply doomed to lay the \u0026lsquo;blame\u0026rsquo; at the doorsteps of a spurious metaphysic, mysterious class interests, or whatever else takes your fancy.\nAgain, the description of the \u0026lsquo;priests\u0026rsquo; of Hinduism was not specially coined for the Brahmins. This too has a heraldry and a tradition within Europe. Its ancestry stretches back to the Greeks; using such theories to attak heathen priests is as old as Christianity itself.\nThe point I want to make is the following: the multiple constructions of hinduism, those several descriptions of the brahmin priests (including the pejorative terminology) were developed within Europe, applied internally in its culture first. This process resulted in the elaboration of a \u0026rsquo;theoretical\u0026rsquo; framework, which was later used to describe other cultures, including the Indian.\nIf we lose sight of internal developments in Europe, we are likely to misread (the way Inden does) what European intellectuals did with respect to Hinduism and, more importantly, why they did so. By the same token, one reproduces the same intellectual mistakes without realizing what these mistakes were.\nIn other words, Indological discourse was to a very great extent determined by the kind of issues that European culture was struggling with. These issues and their resolutions has made Europe into a culture, and Indological discourse expresses the different phases in the self-constitution of the European culture.\nUnderstanding such issues, however, requires doing something that neither Halbfass nor Inden do. It requires looking at the participants in this encounter (especially the western intellectuals) as individuals-in-a-culture. They are not supra-humans embodying a set of metaphysic (which seems to float around in a non-cultural world but highly catching as a disease) or raising some \u0026lsquo;deep\u0026rsquo; hermeneutic questions in vacuum. It requires too that the chronicle penned by Inden and Halbfass be retold: as a story of one culture\u0026rsquo;s way understanding the other; seeing, in such a story, how the West has become a culture; framing such a story not in some culture-free term (for, that indeed is the self-image of the West as a culture) but showing how the West has so far always looked at the \u0026lsquo;other\u0026rsquo; in terms of its self-image. Contra Inden, this is what has happened so far: the western culture never grasped the \u0026lsquo;otherness\u0026rsquo; of another culture. The others have been but the pale and erring variants of itself. If anything is characteristic of the western culture, it has been the above. Inden treads the same path as well.\nHalbfass and Inden have written excellent books. If I have dwelt on some of their weak points, it is because such a criticism has a purpose today. It is to say that until intellectuals from other cultures start providing partial descriptions of the world against the background of their own cultures, our understanding is not likely to grow.\nBoth Halbfass and Inden would agree with this sentiment. They would concur too in the assessment of what has been produced by intellectuals from elsewhere: either a mimentic reproduction of western quasi-theories or a third rate rehash of more abominable ideas from the western commonsense.\nThe publication of these two books could turn out to be an event in the history of Indology and anthropology. It will be an intellectual non-event, however, if all we are going to get hereafter is a \u0026lsquo;mini-Inden\u0026rsquo; in Delhi and a \u0026lsquo;mini-Halbfass\u0026rsquo; in Bombay. This critical notice is hoped as a contribution to the former\u0026ndash;but whether intellectuals from India (and elsewhere) will feel challenged by the inadequacies and dead-ends of the intellectual traditions these two books represent is something that only future can tell.\nWilhelm HALBFASS, India and Europe: An Essay in Understanding.

Rules Without Meaning: Ritual, Mantras and the Human Sciences. Toronto Studies in Religion, Vol. 4. New York and Bern: Peter Lang, 1989 xxii+490.\nIn order to set the tone of this review article, let me begin straightway with a confession: I have been a closet admirer of Frits Staal ever since I discovered his writings in 1987. The reasons that undergird my attitude are several: firstly, most of his writings are about a culture I am familiar with, namely, India; secondly, absent from them is the dewy-eyed romanticism that is pernicious to any serious study of cultures and people; thirdly, present in them are insights that are immensely important and extremely exciting; fourthly, the theses argued for are the results of absolutely pioneering research which fly in the face of deeply entrenched commonsense wisdom; and so on… He is my fellow-traveler on more tracks than one, and my own thinking on several subjects over the last few years carry the deep imprint of Staal\u0026rsquo;s rigorous thinking and painstaking enquiries.\nNo admiration, however, is unqualified at all levels and mine is no exception. My unease arises from the fact that, for some reason or the other, Staal seems to stop short of building his formidable insights into a well-articulated theory. The book under review, Rules without Meaning, which pulls together many strands of research that Staal pursued over the last decade, exemplifies this tendency too.\nThe book is about many things: language and meaning, rituals and mantras, science and philosophy, religion and music. Not only are there general considerations about each of these themes but they are also supported by empirical studies of one culture, namely, India. In this sense, Rules without Meaning is an anthropological study of aspects of Indian culture as well. Nor merely that. Staal enters into polemics with Tambiah, Obeyesekere, and Geertz about their methodologies. Thus it is a book about theories and methodologies. The sub-title of the book, Rituals and Mantras and the Human Sciences, appropriately enough, tells us how ambitious Staal\u0026rsquo;s project is. He cuts across disciplinary boundaries by tackling several authors active in different domains of social sciences. He believes too that what is being said is of relevance not just to sanskritists, indologists, or to scholars active in the domain of religion alone. Even though it is indubitable that his insights, if true, will have profound repercussions on various human sciences, it is nevertheless not obvious to an attentive reader what Staal\u0026rsquo;s theory amounts to. By the time we reach the end of the book, we will know the several theses Staal argues for. But their impact is not so evident because one does not quite know what to do with them. This may sound both exaggerated and unfair because Staal keeps continuously emphasizing the importance of theory building to scientific endeavor throughout the book. In this review, I will present a reasonable case for making the criticism stick.\nConsider, for instance, the bare bones of Staal\u0026rsquo;s claims about Ritual: it is a meaningless activity (but not valueless because of that); exhibits a recursive structure; and, as related to the above two, the syntax of the natural languages may have their evolutionary origin in Ritual. These claims (especially the first two) are the results of painstaking analyses of some of the Vedic rituals, which have been transmitted in their original form for over thousands of years in India. However one might look at them, it must be admitted that these are revolutionary claims. They are not badly stated either. The evidence that Staal presents for each of these theses is extremely impressive—together, they stand more than a cut above anything that anthropologists have ever presented in defense of the opposite, commonsense view that rituals are \u0026lsquo;symbolic activities\u0026rsquo; which carry deep meanings.\nAs though this is not enough, Staal uncouples ritual from religion and, as he puts it, from society (p.141). I am not sure what he wants to say by the latter, but that ritual needs to be looked at independent of religion is something I agree with. Furthermore, with respect to religion, he makes the claim that it may not be universal and refers explicitly to India in particular and Asia in general.\nThis is where Staal\u0026rsquo;s thesis becomes intriguing and cries out for a theory. If ritual transmission is so strong in India, if transmission of religion has characterized the West, how have they affected these two different cultures? What, furthermore, does this tell about human cultures? These questions provide us with a serious entry-point to theorize about cultural differences and hence about human culture itself.\nHere is where Staal disappoints us the most. Despite his repeated emphasis throughout the book on the need to build theories, there is very little attempt to do so. At least one reason for this failure is Staal\u0026rsquo;s own meta-theoretical commitments as they are reflected on at least two levels. Firstly, what contemporary philosophy has become: a profession which confuses building theories with providing arguments for making this or that thesis appears plausible or acceptable. Of course, this may not be just a conclusion. It could be the result of holding the no-longer tenable view that scientific explanations are some sort of deductive arguments. Secondly, rather naive notion of what sciences are and thus what human sciences can be: if some phenomenon is not \u0026lsquo;universal\u0026rsquo; then a theory about it cannot be set up (e.g. p.63).\nThe first point must be evident to students of contemporary philosophy, but the second may require a word or two. If it is the case, as Staal suggests, that India knows of no religion whereas the West does, it is no doubt that trying to build a theory about the origin of religion and its continuous persistence in human cultures will not bear fruit. But we must not lose sight of the fact that the affirmation about the universality of religion is a theoretical claim, which has issued forth from some or another theory about human beings. (A skeptic need only glance thru the writings of Hume, Durkheim, Freud, etc. to be convinced of this.) An alternative to a theoretical claim cannot be anything less than a theory explaining not merely why religion is not a cultural universal but also why it is nevertheless believed to be one. That is to say, the localized existence of a social phenomenon, when it has hitherto been argued to be a cultural universal, poses a problem whose solution requires the presence of theory. It will not, of course be a theory of religion (in the sense of Hume and others) but one which can tackle religion as a trait of a specific culture. It might do so by theorizing cultures in terms of their differences. Religion could turn out to be a phenomenon present in one specific culture, but only a theory about human cultures could tell what it means to make such a claim.\nIn contrast to the above route, Staal\u0026rsquo;s ideas seem to roughly run thus: religion is not a universal, hence it may not be possible to set up a theory about it; ritual probably is, hence a theory may be possible. But what if ritual is not a cultural universal either? I believe it is not. As I see the issue, ritual and religion are mutually exclusive as cultural phenomena. Of course, commonsense wisdom makes ritual into an integral part of religion (\u0026lsquo;religious\u0026rsquo; rituals) and even speaks in terms of \u0026lsquo;ritualistic\u0026rsquo; religions. I think that this is wrong. The way to decide the case is by building an adequate theory about both\u0026ndash;one which tells us why religion and/or ritual are not cultural universals or whether they are. A singular negative statement does, of course, falsify universally quantified statements. As student of cultures, however, we must not forget that our problems actually begin here: why did we hitherto believe in the universality of some cultural phenomenon? Why does it enjoy merely a localized existence? Solutions to these questions require nothing short of building theory.\nThe reason why I have emphasized the absence of theory in Staal\u0026rsquo;s writings is simply this: without a theory, even truly revolutionary insights end up getting trivialized. This is what Staal has done to himself. There is no better way to appreciate the predicament than follow Staal in his own reasoning. For the brevity, I shall focus on just one**theme (religion).\nStaal takes exception to the existing concepts of religion and their \u0026lsquo;applicability\u0026rsquo; (!) in Asia. He motivates this stance on two grounds in his most extended considerations on the subject so far (1989). The first ground involves using a rather narrow concept of religion based upon the three western monotheisms, and seeing the extent to which such a concept is useful in Asia. What would this narrow concept be?\n(E)ven if we do not seek to provide a precise definition, it is not entirely unclear what would be involved in a concept of religion based upon Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. It would involve such notions as a belief in God, a holy book, and (at least in two cases out of these three) a historic founder. Taking our cue from this last exception (the fact that Judaism has no founder), we can meaningfully ask whether it is feasible to apply to Asia a concept of religion that requires the presence of at least two of these three characteristics. (397-398.)\nWhat would we find in Asia were we to apply this narrow concept of religion?\nWhat we find, even with these relatively flexible characteristics, is that none of the so-called religions of Asia is a religion in this sense. Buddhism, for example, has a founder, but neither belief in God, nor a holy book…Taoism does not have a belief in God…Tantrism does not appear as an independent movement. It is allied with Buddhism or Saivism, and shares characteristics with theYoga which enters into similar alliances. Shintoism lacks all three characteristics. Confucianism possesses only one: it has a founder. And so our conclusion can only be that any notion of religion that is based on the characteristics of the three Western monotheistic religions is inapplicable in Asia (398).\nThere is, to be sure, a great deal of truth to his empirical description of the Asian traditions. However, it is not clear that these properties make the three western monotheisms into religions either. Could Jesus be considered a founder of Christianity? An \u0026lsquo;orthodox\u0026rsquo; Christian would be hard put to answer the question unambiguously: there cannot be a Christ figure without there being a past to Christianity. The fulfillment of God\u0026rsquo;s promise is the event of the coming of Christ in flesh, but that does not make Jesus into the founder of Christianity in any unambiguous sense. If Christianity is the continuation of the \u0026lsquo;real\u0026rsquo; tradition, then it is no breakaway group with Jesus as its founder. If Judaism is the \u0026lsquo;real\u0026rsquo; tradition, then Christianity is the splinter movement. This point is equally true for Islam. Again, a Muslim would be hard put to answer the question unambiguously: if the prophet Muhammad was not there, in all probability, there would be no Islam. However, the Muslim would continue, Muhammad was merely the last prophet of God in a line of other earlier prophets. In this sense, just as is the case with Christianity, if one sees Islam as the continuation of the \u0026lsquo;real\u0026rsquo; tradition, Muhammad did not found a new religion. On the other hand, if Mohammed was no prophet at all then one could say that he founded a new religion. Equally, Christ need not have asked Peter to build the Church\u0026ndash;would Christianity have been any less of a religion for that? As far as holy books are concerned, there were Christians before the gospels were codified after all. In other words, it can be plausibly maintained (to some extent) that Christianity itself need not necessarily have these properties in order to be a religion. Of course, as a matter of historical fact, we do describe (from the outside) Christianity in terms of its holy book, the figure of Christ, the Churches, and such like. How much of this is historical contingency, and how much by virtue of the fact that Christianity is a religion?\nThe same point could be made with respect to belief in God. Even though I have tried to argue that \u0026lsquo;atheistic religiosity\u0026rsquo; is Christianity gone secular, and I have difficulty in comprehending how God could become irrelevant to being religious, this argument does not establish that such religions could not exist elsewhere or that they could not come into being. In this sense, even this possibility requires to be left open until that stage where we could show that belief in God is essential not to just these three religious traditions, but to the very nature of religion itself.\nThe reply to Staal, then, could be that this \u0026rsquo;narrow concept\u0026rsquo; is inapplicable in Asia because its \u0026lsquo;applicability\u0026rsquo; to the Western monotheisms is itself suspect.\nHis second argument involves using an \u0026rsquo;extended\u0026rsquo; concept of religion, which includes or incorporates the categories of \u0026lsquo;doctrine\u0026rsquo; (belief), ritual, mystical experience, and meditation. He argues (I will not summarize the points here) that because the last three consist of other categories more fundamental than the concept \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo;, an \u0026rsquo;extended\u0026rsquo; concept of religion that comprises of these three is an incoherent concept. As such, the category \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo; exhibits\nall the characteristics of pathological, if not monstrous growth, tumorous with category blunders. It is worse than a spider with a submarine, a burning bush, an expectation, and a human head. We have found that the trio of ritual, meditation and mystical experience consists of categories that are more fundamental than the category religion itself (401).\nConsequently, he suggests that we take a terminological decision and confine the term \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo; to Western monotheisms.\nLet us go along with Staal for a moment and take this terminological decision. What exactly does this imply? It could imply several things, depending on how we state the thesis. What I shall do now is to provide three versions of Staal\u0026rsquo;s thesis\u0026ndash; a weak version, a strong version, and a stronger version. Even though more variants are possible, these three are enough to appreciate the problem.\n(a) Our conceptualization of religion has been inadequate. We need to develop a more adequate, more sophisticated, and a more fine-grained concept of religion in order to satisfactorily account for different religions.\nThe weak version of Staal\u0026rsquo;s thesis would almost win universal consensus. No intellectual worthy of his name would resist a plea for developing subtler and richer concepts. Further, there is also a quasi-universal consensus that the \u0026lsquo;Western\u0026rsquo; concept of religion is inadequate. Staal subscribes to this thesis as he explicitly states:\nA philosophy of religion worthy of its name should begin with a discussion of the concept of religion and an investigation into the status of a possible science of religion based upon what is presently known about religions or so-called religions of mankind (418; italics mine).\nBut then, people have been doing precisely this for over a hundred years. This weak thesis does not entail that we confine the concept of religion to western monotheisms. If we cannot use the concept \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo;, which other concept shall we use? Indeed, many would be willing to concur with Staal that\nthe imposition of the Western concept of religion on the rest of the world illustrates how Western imperialism continues to thrive in the realm of thought (419).\nThey would also add that one has to start somewhere, with the existing concept of religion for example, and appropriately extend it, modify it, enlarge it, refine it, by studying other cultures. Studying what in other cultures though? Why, religions of course. Staal would also agree with this point of view because, as he says, we should base ourselves upon what is presently known both about religions and the \u0026ldquo;so-called religions\u0026rdquo; of humankind.\nLet us now look at the strong thesis.\n(b) We cannot use our concept of religion to translate certain concepts in Asia, because both this concept and the concept cluster associated with it are absent in its culture.\nThis is the strong version of his thesis, which may or may not imply the weaker thesis. (That is to say, it is logically independent of the truth of the weak version.) It does entail that the \u0026lsquo;western\u0026rsquo; concepts of religion are not applicable in Asia. Staal subscribes to this thesis as well:\n(T)erms for religion that refer to its doctrinal content are relatively rare in the languages of Asia and are invariably of recent date…In India, the term dharma has been used in the sense of \u0026ldquo;religion\u0026rdquo; in expressions like Hindu dharma, bauddha dharma, jaina dharma only during the last few centuries. The same holds for the Chinese tsang-chiao and the Japanese shukyo. The concept of \u0026ldquo;Hinduism\u0026rdquo;, incidentally, came up in the thirties of the nineteenth century in English literature (390; italics mine).\nOne of the reasons why this strong thesis might not entail the weaker version has to do with the italicized portion of the citation. If one uses the concept of religion to refer to \u0026lsquo;doctrinal contents\u0026rsquo;, then the point could hold. However, this concept is not the only one floating around. There are other \u0026lsquo;western concepts\u0026rsquo; too such as those that refer to an \u0026rsquo;experience of the Holy\u0026rsquo;, the \u0026lsquo;absolute\u0026rsquo;, or of a \u0026lsquo;mysterium tremendum et fascinans\u0026rsquo;. Or, again, if the \u0026lsquo;western\u0026rsquo; concept constitutes a \u0026lsquo;polythetic\u0026rsquo; class, in which the \u0026lsquo;doctrinal content\u0026rsquo; is but one property, the entailment that the \u0026lsquo;western\u0026rsquo; concept of religion is inadequate does not hold. The clarion call to refine this concept further, being the platitude that it is, does not get not affected.\nThese remarks are sufficient to turn our attention to the stronger version of the thesis.\n(c) The concept of religion is \u0026lsquo;inapplicable\u0026rsquo; because that which is designated by the term \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo; in the West is absent from the cultures of Asia.\nThe stronger thesis entails the strong thesis (b) by being its explanans. The weaker version is logically independent of this stronger thesis as well, for obvious reasons. To say that religions are absent in Asia is to say that they are unreal in that culture; they are not products of Asia but creations of the West. Staal appears to subscribe to this thesis as well:\nThe inapplicability of Western notions of religion to the traditions of Asia…is also responsible for something more extraordinary: the creation (Staal\u0026rsquo;s emphasis) of so-called religions. This act was primarily engaged in by outsiders and foreigners, but is sometimes subsequently accepted by members of a tradition. The reasons lie in the nature of Western religion …In most parts of Asia, such religions do not exist, but scholars, laymen and Western converts persist in searching for them. If they cannot find them, they seize upon labels used for indigenous categories, rent them from their original context and use them for subsequent identification of what is now called a \u0026ldquo;religious\u0026rdquo; tradition. Thus there arises a host of religions: Vedic, Brahmanical, Hindu, Buddhist, Bon-po, Tantric, Taoist, Confucian, Shinto, etc. In Asia such groupings are not only uninteresting and uninformative, but tinged with the unreal (393; italics, unless otherwise indicated, mine).\nThis is not all. Staal goes even further to emphatically state:\nHinduism does not merely fail to be a religion; it is not even a meaningful unit of discourse (397; my italics).\nThe implication, then, is that religion is not a cultural universal but a conceptual compulsion of a religious culture. If Hinduism is not a meaningful unit of discourse, that is because it does not refer to a single unified phenomenon or even to a set of discrete phenomena. Simply put, it has no reference to anything in the world but a learnt way of answering the question, \u0026lsquo;Are you a Hindu?\u0026rsquo;\nIf Staal subscribes to this version, how then could he argue or accept the following?\nThe study of religion ought to play an important part in the human sciences, for while language provides the foundation for most intellectual activity of the human animal, religion hovers around the loftier realms of human expression and belongs to a domain that lies beyond language(387).\nHe could not; yet he does. My thesis entails the negation of the above sentiment. It may be informative and illuminating, given what I have said during the last few chapters, to note that Staal does not argue for the truth of the above but presupposes it: it is the opening paragraph of his discourse into religion.\nLet me provide a brief overview of the nature of the difference between Staal and me. I am investigating the object designated by the term \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo;; Staal is talking about some or other concept of \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo;. I am arguing that religion\u0026ndash;as an entity\u0026ndash;has not been shown to exist in all cultures; Staal assumes its universality and suggests that the \u0026lsquo;Western\u0026rsquo; concept is incoherent. If I succeed in my aim, I will have argued that religion does not exist in Asia and, therefore, it is not a cultural universal; Staal pleads for a philosophy of religion whose task would involve, among other things, a \u0026lsquo;conceptual analysis\u0026rsquo; of the concept \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo; (or, in more pedantic terms, providing a \u0026lsquo;good definition\u0026rsquo;).\nBy all standards, the first two theses are both lame and trivial. Yet the suggestion that India (Asia) has no religion is anything but lame and trivial. But what is its significance? There is only one way to answer this question and that is by building a theory about religion. How to go about doing this, if religion is not cultural universal? This is not the place to discuss this issue as I have recently completed a manuscript on this very question. (Comparative Science of Cultures and the Universality of Religion. Gent: Cenrum voor Godsdienstwetenschappen, 1991; in the book form, The Heathen in his blindness: Asia, the West and the dynamic of religion, 1994) There I too argue that India (Asia) does not know of religions; and I have been able to shed light on the belief about the universality of religion by beginning to build a theory about religion.\nThere is also a second theme to this difference. Staal is content to note Western imperialism and its continued operation. I think that it is a problem we need to understand. What compels thinkers of today and yesteryears in the West to see and create religions in other cultures? To call it \u0026lsquo;imperialist\u0026rsquo; is to baptize it with a name and names, as we all know, do not explain anything or solve any problem.\nTo the reader of this review, it may appear that I sound negative. But it is anything but that. Staal is probably the most interesting anthropologist/Indologist (professionally he is neither), whose writings are pioneering in every sense of the world. His proposals are immensely important, heuristically powerful, and cognitively productive. Surely, this book is a required reading for any student of human cultures. I have only two regrets, one of which I have already expressed: alas, Staal does not build a theory that can give the required prominence to his revolutionary ideas. There is a second regret too: this book will not be easily accessible to those who need to read it. The extraordinarily prohibitive price of the book will keep it forever away from the personal libraries of intellectuals.\nComments Orville Patton — 2013-12-01 08:13:00\nI do not know whether Frits\u0026rsquo;s (r.i.p) mathematical background came into play in a reluctance to formulate theory , but I deeply regret this aspect as well. There\u0026rsquo;s so much \u0026ldquo;there\u0026rdquo; there, the least we can do is to make bold (and refutable) claims.\n","tags":[],"title":"Review of Staal’s Rules Without Meaning –S.N.Balagangadhara","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/review-of-staals-rules-without-meaning-s-n-balagangadhara/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","published","review","secular","secularization"],"content":"Today, there are multiple images of India current in the West. There is the mystic India, an image that the German Romantics created and the \u0026lsquo;flower children\u0026rsquo; of the sixties made popular. There is the third world India with enormous poverty and suffering, which the developmental workers have projected. There is also the India, the centre of IT outsourcing, which the developments in the last decade have brought into existence, and so on. Amartya Sen, the Indian noble prize-winner in Economics, has written a book on \u0026ldquo;The Argumentative Indian\u0026rdquo; which speaks of an India that he wants us to consider. This India is an India with a history of toleration and pluralism, an India that has brought forth its own version of \u0026lsquo;secularism\u0026rsquo;, and an India that is every bit rational, discursive and analytical as the western culture itself.\nBefore reflecting on some of the issues that Sen raises, let me confess to my disappointment: this collection of essays, written over a period of time, is neither thought-provoking nor deep. Despite the ecstatic reviews this book has received, I find the essays very shallow. They are quite obviously written by an intelligent mind but to say that is to say little about the quality of the essays. They are intelligently mediocre; though in saying this, I am being charitable.\n\u0026lsquo;India is a secular republic\u0026rsquo; – that is what the preamble to Indian constitution grandly proclaims. For nearly two decades now, Indian intellectuals have been debating the nature of this \u0026lsquo;secularism\u0026rsquo; in India. Many prominent intellectuals, including Sen whose own contribution is republished in this book, have argued to and fro on the matter. Much heat has been generated through this debate, it is true, but how about some light?\nTwo background facts are needed to appreciate the force of this question. The first is the emergence of the so-called \u0026lsquo;Hindu right\u0026rsquo; or the \u0026lsquo;Hindu Fundamentalism\u0026rsquo; in India. There is a virtual consensus among the Indian intellectuals that the attempt to create a \u0026lsquo;Hindu State\u0026rsquo; (i.e., a State that proclaims itself to be \u0026lsquo;Hindu\u0026rsquo;), something which those who want to proclaim the \u0026lsquo;Hinduness\u0026rsquo; (Hindutva) want, is a retrograde movement. The BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party), which formed a previous government at the Centre, is seen as a political expression of an attempt by those who argue for this \u0026lsquo;Hinduness\u0026rsquo; (thay are called the \u0026lsquo;HindutvaWaadins\u0026rsquo;). The \u0026lsquo;secular\u0026rsquo; intellectuals have taken to the streets and their pens in order to combat this \u0026lsquo;fascist\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;fundamentalist\u0026rsquo; development in the Indian society.\nThe second fact, which is of greater importance, is something that Sen also talks about extensively. India has had a very rich history of and experience in pluralism and toleration. Many religious communities have lived together for centuries, without any community being systematically prosecuted because of its faith. So, one would expect the debate on \u0026lsquo;secularism\u0026rsquo; in India would bring new considerations to light than those we know from the familiar debates in the West. Instead, what we find is an atrocious rehash of the western discussions, conducted mostly by those who know little or nothing of the western intellectual history. Quite apart from throwing light on their intellectual ignorance, this empty argument about the different meaning that \u0026lsquo;secularism\u0026rsquo; has in India also raises an issue that is puzzling: if Indian culture has such a deep appreciation of tolerance and pluralism, why are not the Indian intellectuals reflecting on such a rich cultural experience? Why do they, like Sen does, merely parrot what we already know, namely, that the state can be \u0026rsquo;neutral\u0026rsquo; towards religion either by supporting all religions equally or by being equidistant from all religions? Surely, we need more than such a text-book reproduction or a slogan like \u0026lsquo;in India, secularism is a way of life\u0026rsquo;, to understand why \u0026lsquo;secularism\u0026rsquo; is a problem in the Indian society and culture of the twenty-first century.\nThere is even a deeper puzzle. When you read the debates on Indian secularism, you are left with the impression that you understand what \u0026lsquo;Hindu Fundamentalism\u0026rsquo; is. This impression has to do with the assumption that Hinduism is a religion the way Christianity, Judaism and Islam are also religions. Yet, if there is one fact that all students of Hinduism (whether from the West or from the East) agree upon, it is this: Hinduism is not a religion like the Semitic religions. It has no founder, no church, no creeds, no dogmas; no single practice or belief or holy book is common to all those who call themselves as \u0026lsquo;Hindus\u0026rsquo;. So, what makes \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; into a religion at all? This question knows of different answers, but that is not at issue here. The issue is: what is the \u0026lsquo;Hindu Fundamentalism\u0026rsquo; that the \u0026lsquo;secularists\u0026rsquo; oppose?\nLet me develop this issue a bit more. Basically, it involves the problem of Hindu-Muslim relations in India. In the Indian debate on the Hindu-Muslim problem, three parties claim to offer a solution. The secularists argue the need for a secular state in India; the Hindu nationalists or the Hindutvawadins plead the case for a Hindu state; and the anti-secular Gandhians claim that the Indian tradition has the resources to handle the question of pluralism of religions. For the sake of argument and convenience, I will divide these parties into two groups, viz., secularists and anti-secularists.\nOn the one hand, there are the proponents of secularism: they propose that the Hindus and the Muslims (and the other communities) should accept a common framework of secular law. This framework claims neutrality with respect to all religions. The position of secularism in India is generally associated with the ideas of her first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, who said that \u0026ldquo;no state can be civilised except a secular state\u0026rdquo;. The Indian secularists generally defend a position well known to political theory: the religious neutrality of a liberal state.\nOn the other hand, there are the opponents of secularism: they refuse to accept the western theories about the religiously neutral state and offer an alternate system of traditional values. The different communities, they feel, should accept this system as the common framework. Its fundamental principle is the equality of religions: since all of them are incomplete manifestations of a supreme truth, all religions are equal. This group consists of the advocates of Hindutva on the one side and the Gandhian anti-secularists on the other. Although there are significant differences between these two anti-secularist parties, they agree on one issue: in India, one should not separate politics from religion because Hinduism yields a more tolerant politics than western secularism. When Balraj Madhok, one of the Hindutva spokesmen, says that \u0026ldquo;Hindu secularism\u0026rdquo; is superior to western secularism, he is voicing a widespread opinion:\n\u0026hellip; ll through the history, the Hindu state has been secular. All Hindu rulers were expected to live up to the ideal of \u0026lsquo;Sarva Panth Sama Bhava\u0026rsquo; in their dealings with the people. This concept of \u0026rsquo;equal respect for all panths or ways of worship\u0026rsquo; is a positive concept with a much wider and broader meaning than what is conveyed by the concept of secularism as accepted in the West (Madhok 1995: 116).\nOr, to let the most distinguished among the Gandhian anti-secularists, Ashis Nandy, explain the moral of his story:\n\u0026hellip;t is time to recognize that, instead of trying to build religious tolerance on the good faith or the conscience of a small group of de-ethnicized, middle-class politicians, bureaucrats, and intellectuals, a far more serious venture would be to explore the philosophy, the symbolism, and the theology of tolerance in the faiths of the citizens and hope that the state systems in South Asia may learn something about religious tolerance from everyday Hinduism, Islam, Buddhism, or Sikhism rather than wish that ordinary Hindus, Muslims, Buddhists, and Sikhs will learn tolerance from the various fashionable secular theories of statecraft (Nandy 1998: 338).\nThe anti-secularists challenge the secular belief that different religious communities can live together in a society only within the framework of a religiously neutral state. Thus, this debate revolves around one of the basic tenets of the contemporary theories of toleration, viz., the belief that state neutrality is necessary for a peaceful and viable plural society.\nOne should not reduce the clash between secularism and anti-secularism to a clash between a tolerant, progressive left and an intolerant, conservative right. Instead, it is a clash between two frameworks both claiming to provide a solution to the problem of conflicts between the different communities in Indian society.\nSome go even further and claim that the concept of tolerance is inadequate to represent the Hindu way of life: \u0026ldquo;You can hate a man but still tolerate him. But there is no hatred. You recognize the right of every person to have his own belief. He is recognized and respected – religion is no barrier for mutual love and understanding. This is the Hindu attitude\u0026rdquo; (K. Suryanarayana Rao in Kanungo 2002: 125).\nSince their organizations are often involved in the hate campaigns and the violence against the Muslims, one could suggest that such people are hypocrites. In that case, we need to question the neutrality of the secular parties as well: they have consistently failed to treat the Muslims and the Hindus on equal terms. For instance, several reforms were imposed on the Hindu traditions by the Indian state under Congress rule, whereas Islam was left untouched. Instead of getting into such a dispute, let us take the claims of the two parties at face value.\nBoth parties agree on the objective of a peacefully diverse society. Both allow people to worship, pray, or do puja in whichever way they prefer and to whatever god(s) they prefer. Both allow the followers of the various religions to visit their mosques, churches, gurudwaras, temples, or stay home. Both allow people to believe in one God, or in three or five thousand gods or claim that there is no God. If there is agreement on all these issues, what then is the clash about?\nIn vain, you search for an answer to this question either in Sen\u0026rsquo;s book or in the decade-long discussions on \u0026lsquo;secularism\u0026rsquo; in India. In fact, and this is even worse, there is not even a sense that such a question is present. Repeating the western arguments glibly, as Sen does, takes us hardly any further. It is not my intention to provide answer to this question here, but I would be amiss if I did not locate the direction in which answers have to be sought.\nIn the western culture, the problem about the neutrality of the state emerged when different Christian denominations confronted each other, each claiming to be the embodiment of \u0026ldquo;the truth\u0026rdquo;. The same problem continues to persist, when different Semitic religions (Judaism, Christianity and Islam) confront each other: each claim to be the exclusive purveyor of (the Biblical) God\u0026rsquo;s revelation. However, \u0026lsquo;pagan\u0026rsquo; traditions, whether from the European Antiquity or from the Indian subcontinent of today, do not make such claims. Instead, they suggest that all religions are partial answers and that, therefore, no religion is either true or false. Consequently, the modern Indian society does not confront the question, which the European societies confronted. In India, the \u0026lsquo;pagan\u0026rsquo; traditions are a living force; they confront the Semitic religions that argue the opposite. Consequently, the problem of \u0026lsquo;secularism\u0026rsquo; in India cannot even be formulated (let alone answered) by reproducing ill-understood clichés from political philosophy textbooks. It is in such mindless repetitions that we see the intellectual poverty of the \u0026lsquo;secularist\u0026rsquo; thinkers like Sen.\nThe failure of Sen, and generations of intellectuals in India, can be localized in their absence of insights into both their culture and the western culture, even though they think they understand both. Perhaps, nowhere is this more forceful than in Sen\u0026rsquo;s urgency to show that India is every bit as \u0026lsquo;rational\u0026rsquo; as the West. Let me leave aside the image about the \u0026lsquo;rational West\u0026rsquo; but focus instead on the \u0026lsquo;mystical East\u0026rsquo;.\nEver since German Romanticism, the period when translations of Indian texts into European languages occurred, it is indubitable that India has been seen as a \u0026lsquo;mystical\u0026rsquo; culture. It is also true that this image has often been used to portray India and her culture in unflattering ways. Quite independent of these issues, however, there is an intellectual problem: is this image false? Could we make the claim that, for centuries, the westerners (travelers, tourists, intellectuals, bureaucrats, etc) have been hallucinating in their perceptions about the \u0026lsquo;mystical\u0026rsquo; nature of the Indian traditions? If we say \u0026lsquo;yes\u0026rsquo;, how shall we go about either explaining or understanding this massive hallucination about India? We cannot use explanations from Individual Psychology: it is impossible to argue that, for the last 250 years, all westerners share the same psychology. Social psychology will not help us either because the western society has changed in the course of the last three centuries. We do not have a Cultural Psychology that can tell us why people in the western culture have a tendency to succumb to such a massive hallucination. In other words, the explanatory problem is so huge that it is embarrassing to see people not even recognizing its existence, when they go on pontificating about India and her culture. Surely, no one can take the claim seriously that one culture (the western culture) has only hallucinated about another culture (the Indian, in our case) for centuries on end, unless one can come with a theory explaining such a \u0026ldquo;cultural hallucination\u0026rdquo;. Needless to say, neither Sen nor those like him who claim to \u0026lsquo;know\u0026rsquo; both the East and the West have even a clue how to go about accomplishing such a task.\nI owe the reader an answer , but the size of the article prevents me from saying much more. Let me, therefore, issue guidance instead: my research in Vergelijkende Cultuurwetenschap takes up these and analogous questions in an attempt to understand the relations and the interactions between the western culture and the Indian culture. It is against this background that I judge intellectuals coming up with their favorite hobby-horses. Against such a background, only one judgment is possible about Amartya Sen\u0026rsquo;s efforts: it is pathetically poor.\ni. For the answer, check Balu\u0026rsquo;s student\u0026rsquo;s book Europe, India, and the Limits of Secularism.\nFor more, check the following articles:\nDark hour of secularism: Hindu fundamentalism and colonial liberalism\nThe secular state and religious conflict: liberal neutrality and the Indian case of pluralism\nComments Umang Dixit — 2014-01-25 21:47:00\nFascinating and wonderful.

It is a study of the western culture using one thread, namely, religion. To the extent I talk about India, I do so using some of the \u0026lsquo;facts\u0026rsquo; that Indologists (and others) have so far used. My use of their facts (to show the opposite of what they believe they have shown) illustrates the consensus in the philosophies of sciences (of the last hundred years or more) that \u0026lsquo;facts\u0026rsquo; are mostly facts of a theory.\nIn its simplest form my thesis is conditional in nature: \u0026ldquo;If Judaism, Christianity and Islam are what religions are, then Indian culture does not have \u0026rsquo;native\u0026rsquo; religions.\u0026rdquo; By the same token, if \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; etc are religions, then Judaism etc are no religions. The book builds this thesis in several ways: (a) through historical narrations and analyses; (b) through arguments; (c) by building a hypothesis, etc. If you want to challenge this thesis, you will have to build a thorough-going criticism of the entire book.\nLet us agree to conduct our discussion in a systematic fashion. Doing so would allow us to (a) localize our disagreements; (b) formulate the criticisms succinctly; (c) identify the arguments we need to accept or reject; (d) indicate the manner of resolving disagreements etc.\nWith these preliminaries out of the way, let us begin at the beginning.\nI argue that the western culture claims that religion is a cultural universal but that this claim is not the result of (a) empirical enquiries or of (b) a defensible theoretical hypothesis. In other words, I talk both about the western culture and about what this culture says. Do you disagree with this argument? If you disagree, you will have to show either (a) that a substantial empirical enquiry has been undertaken in the western culture to investigate the existence or non-existence of religions in other cultures or (b) there is a very satisfying theory about why religion should exist in all cultures. In both cases, we need references to details: either the names of people who have done such research and their works or a summary of such research. In case you feel that this is too broad for a beginning, let me propose an alternative: what reasons are there to believe that religion exists in all cultures? What would happen if we discover some or another culture that does not know of religion? Here, your arguments would suffice.\nDepending on which of the two options you choose, we can look forward to a fruitful discussion.\n","tags":[],"title":"Refutation","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/refutation/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","basics"],"content":" Whether or not we observe \u0026lsquo;commonalities\u0026rsquo; has to do with the descriptive framework we use. Things might share common properties in one description; at the same time, share nothing common in another description. Both could be true descriptions of the same set of objects. \u0026lsquo;Perception of similarity\u0026rsquo; is (at the moment our knowledge is in) is extremely difficult to analyze and understand. On the one hand, our perceptual abilities (as they have evolved out of a successful adaptation to the world) must tell us what is present in the world. Otherwise, we could not have evolved. (We share this with other products of evolutionary development, i.e. with other species.) On the other hand, we cannot say what that similarity is without using a descriptive frame work. (When the notion of \u0026lsquo;similarity\u0026rsquo; poses such problems, the problem of \u0026lsquo;commonality\u0026rsquo; is even more difficult to solve. This is a matter of huge philosophical debate: do two objects share the \u0026lsquo;common property\u0026rsquo; of \u0026ldquo;being blue\u0026rdquo; or are they merely similar to each other?) Even though I have no solution to this problem, I fail to see the relevance of solving it for my enterprise. 2.1. You say: \u0026ldquo;While our Western observers mistakenly saw religion in India…\u0026rdquo;. As a scientist, you should know that Nature cannot be cut at its joints because Nature does not have joints. It is our theory (or description) of the world that allows us to speak of (relatively) independent phenomena like gravitation, electrical forces, magnetism, nuclear attraction and such like. Again, it is our theories that try to unify these forces. That is to say, our theories first distinguished them, only to try and unify them at a later stage. The same applies to culture. The western observers did not \u0026lsquo;see\u0026rsquo; religion; their hypothesis about religion allowed them to construct a phenomenon (from a set of facts which their hypothesis singled out as relevant) they called Hinduism as a religion. So, unless you are willing to argue that cultures comprise of distinct and discrete phenomena called \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;politics\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;secular\u0026rsquo; and such like, you cannot claim that the western observers saw \u0026lsquo;something\u0026rsquo; that is discrete and that they mistakenly described it as a religion.\n2.2. You say, \u0026ldquo;I have no doubt that they did follow the principle of not unnecessarily multiplying entities…\u0026rdquo; You should have doubts, because it is historically false. (a) They spoke of one religion called Hinduism because heathendom or paganism was \u0026lsquo;one phenomenon\u0026rsquo; for them. (b) Why they did not speak in terms of regional religions has to do with the fact that their theory about religion did not tie religion to either a people or a region. Such an attitude of tying \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo; to a people has more to do with the notions of \u0026rsquo;traditions\u0026rsquo; (as the Romans used them). (c) As their \u0026lsquo;knowledge\u0026rsquo; of India accumulated, they made many differentiations. For instance, they spoke of \u0026lsquo;Vedism\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;Brahmanism\u0026rsquo; as the religions that preceded \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo;. The latter is the corrupt version of the purer \u0026lsquo;Brahmanism\u0026rsquo;. (d) They also differentiated between Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism, Bhakti movement, etc. as religions that are distinct and different from \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo;. Today\u0026rsquo;s wisdom wants to speak of \u0026lsquo;Hinduisms\u0026rsquo; in the plural and not just \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo;.\nIn other words, they did not follow Occam\u0026rsquo;s Razor in not \u0026lsquo;multiplying\u0026rsquo; entities. However, if they did (as you suggest), I am afraid you are contradicting yourself. Multiplication of entities refers to multiplying \u0026rsquo;theoretical\u0026rsquo; entities, and not observational ones. If they \u0026lsquo;saw\u0026rsquo; Hinduism, Occam\u0026rsquo;s Razor is not applicable (you see what there is, is it not?); if they followed the argument of Occam, then they could not have seen Hinduism but postulated its existence as a theoretical entity.\n2.3. You then go on: \u0026ldquo;So whatever it was they observed, there was sufficient commonality in it.\u0026rdquo; I do not see how you can say this. \u0026lsquo;Commonality\u0026rsquo; is a concept we use in describing. When we say some things have some properties in common, it is shorthand for the following: we can build a set with a specific set of properties and we can give a true description of some objects such that they constitute a set. Neither in Nature nor in Culture could we say that objects have \u0026lsquo;commonalities\u0026rsquo;. Objects have something in common in one set of descriptions; in another set of descriptions, they need have nothing in common. From this it follows, they could \u0026lsquo;see\u0026rsquo; commonalities because according to the description they provided, whatever they saw had commonalities.\n2.4. You say: \u0026ldquo;I take our subject of study to be the traditions, teachings and practices of dharma and moksha.\u0026rdquo; Let me just say why this is not sufficient to speak of Hinduism. Kamasutra, under this interpretation, does not belong to Hinduism. But it does talk also mention \u0026lsquo;dharma\u0026rsquo;. What do the Tantriks speak about? They explicitly deny wanting \u0026lsquo;Moksha\u0026rsquo; (so do the naastikas), and they practice \u0026lsquo;adharma\u0026rsquo;. Are the charvakas not Hindus?\n","tags":[],"title":"Commonalities and Similarities—S.N.Balagangadhara","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/commonalitiessimilarities-s-n-balagangadhara/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","basics"],"content":"It is partly a term of the art (in the philosophy of sciences) and partly retains the commonsense usage. When one compares theories (in order to choose the best one among the rivals), one compares them with respect to the important properties that theories should have. What these properties are depends upon the philosophy of science one subscribes to. For instance, one might think that a theory should explain phenomena. If this demand is put, then one chooses a theory that does a better job at explaining the phenomenon. One might add additional conditions to this demand in order to clarify what it means to explain \u0026lsquo;better\u0026rsquo;. For instance, one might want to say that some theory X explains a phenomenon better than theory Y if X can explain some additional things as well, or explains things that theory Y cannot explain. One might further add that the theory X should be falsifiable or that it has more facts in its favor. Or, again, one could suggest that the theory X is better than Y because X solves more problems than Y. Or again, that X is more useful in prediction than Y. And so on. In other words, what constitutes \u0026lsquo;better\u0026rsquo; (in the claim that theory X is better than theory Y) depends very much on the kind of philosophy of science that one accepts.\nWith respect to \u0026lsquo;The heathen\u0026hellip;\u0026rsquo;, I suggest (and partially argue) the following. My theory is better than any other theory in the market place because it can fulfill the demands put across by the different philosophies of sciences.

Apart from describing the fall of bodies on earth, it also tied the motion of planets and the ebb and tide in the sea to each other. This theory allowed us to predict the motion of the planets and helped us discover a new planet in the solar system. In other words, it provided a theory that unified phenomena. Until that stage, we did not know that these three phenomena were linked together, and we had independent explanations for each of them. This is one of the things that a theory does: it identifies the phenomena that belong together.\nThe issue before us is this: when the west (let us stick to the west for the time being) unified some phenomena into something they thought was a religion and called it \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo;, were they guided here by a theory (i.e. a theology) as well? If yes, the first question is this: did this theory tie certain practices and beliefs together into a phenomenon (called \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo;) that do not belong together, or did they merely describe a unitary phenomenon in a wrong way? That is to say, is the \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; that we know through a standard text book story made into a something (a unified phenomenon) through the use of theology? Or, did the west merely describe \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; wrongly, namely, as a religion?\nNotice though that by suggesting that Hinduism does not exist, one is not saying that those beliefs and practices that went into constructing this unity do not exist. What one is denying is that these beliefs and practices (taken together) constitute a phenomenon called \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo;.\nLet me provide an imaginary example and draw an analogy. Imagine someone coming to earth and noticing the following phenomena: grass is green, milk turns sour, birds fly and some flowers put out a fragrant smell. He is convinced that these are organically related to each other and sees \u0026lsquo;hipkapi\u0026rsquo; in them. The presence of hipkapi not only explains the above phenomena are but also how they are related to each other. To those who doubt the existence of hipkapi, he draws their attention to its visible manifestation: the tigers eating the gazelle, dogs chasing the cats, and the massive size of the elephants. Each of these is a fact, as everyone can see it. But, of course, neither severally nor individually do they tell us anything about hipkapi. When more like him come to earth and reiterate the presence of hipkapi, other conditions permitting, hipkapi not only becomes a synonym for these (which?) phenomena but also turns out to be their explanation. Thereafter, to ask what hipkapi is, or even how it explains, is an expression of one\u0026rsquo;s idiocy: does not everyone see hipkapi, this self-explanatory thing? This is what the Europeans did. The puja in the temples, the sandhyavandanam of the Brahmins, the Sahasranamams, etc. became organic parts of the Indian religion. Purushasukta was the cosmogenic explanation of the caste system, and untouchability its outward manifestation. Dharma and adharma were the Sanskrit names for \u0026lsquo;good\u0026rsquo; and \u0026rsquo;evil\u0026rsquo;, the Indian deities were much like their Greek counterparts. To the missionaries, we were the idolaters; to the emasculated liberal, we are mere polytheists. In the analogy I have used, the visitor \u0026lsquo;constructs\u0026rsquo; the hipkapi. To him, it becomes an experiential entity. He talks about this experiential entity, as his fellow-beings do, in a systematic way. The facts exist; does the hipkapi exist? This is the issue. Puja in the temples, the sandhyavandanam of the Brahmins, the Sahasranamams, the Purushasukta, our notions of dharma and adharma, etc. all exist. Does their existence tell us that \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; also exists? Are they organic parts of a phenomenon called \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo;, even if that phenomenon is not a religion?\nIn other words, I am not suggesting that the west provided a false description of the social and cultural reality in India. But the unity they created by tying these things together is the problem: this unity is a unity for them. They had to create such a unified phenomenon because of their theology. They could not understand us otherwise. In discussions about \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo;, this is the problem. Is \u0026lsquo;hipkapi\u0026rsquo; a unified phenomenon or an imaginary entity? Is \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; a unified phenomenon or an imaginary entity?\nThe majority opinion on this issue is clear. \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; exists, but it has not been accurately described. One might want to call it \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo;, the other might say that it is more accurate to speak of \u0026lsquo;Hinduisms\u0026rsquo; (and not in the singular)\u0026hellip; and so on. The post-colonials are willing to concede the \u0026lsquo;construction\u0026rsquo; of Hinduism, but suggest that this construction \u0026rsquo;exists\u0026rsquo; now. In the strict minority of one, what I am saying is that this unity is not a unity within the Indian culture.\nAm I suggesting then that these phenomena are unrelated to each other? Or am I merely suggesting that they have a different relationship to each other? Irrespective of my answers to these questions, the claim holds: Hinduism, the phenomenon constructed by the West, is an experiential entity only to the West and not to us. In this sense, Hinduism is not a part of the Indian culture. It has no existence outside of the western experience of India.\nNow comes the really interesting issue. Could we provide a different description of the Indian culture? Would such a description tell us what exists in India, and which of the above are related to each other and explain how they are related to each other? Yes, I believe, we can. But the absolute presupposition for that the current framework (which we have imbibed through the western scholarship) is completely left behind. Not only do I believe that a different description is possible but also that it will be cognitively superior to the majority view.\nMy article \u0026lsquo;How to speak for the Indian traditions?\u0026rsquo; begins to lay the groundwork for such an endeavor. See whether it is a more interesting attempt or not.\n","tags":["hipkapi"],"title":"‘Hinduism’ and hipkapi: an Imaginary entity –S.N. Balagangadhara","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/hinduism-and-hipkapi-an-imaginary-entity-s-n-balagangadhara/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","Hinduism"],"content":" The English word \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; not only carries multiple meanings it also appears to refer to many different things. If the context of the discussion were to help us disambiguate the reference of this word, it might not pose many problems for a serious discussion. Unfortunately, the context itself gets muddled. Each understands the question \u0026lsquo;Does Hinduism Exist?\u0026rsquo; in a different fashion. As though this is not enough, this confusion enters into other areas as well: witness the challenge for people to prove that Sikhism does not exist. The prima facie evidence seems to be the following: the word \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; seems to carry many different kinds of (ontological) commitments (i.e. when we use the word, we seem to make assumptions about the kind of entities that exist in the world), many different epistemological positions (i.e. how can either know or not know what that word refers to).\nOne of the interesting strategies used in scientific discussions to circumvent this problem, especially when a rival theory enters the fray, is to undertake a linguistic reform. The word \u0026lsquo;Oxygen\u0026rsquo; replaced \u0026lsquo;phlogiston\u0026rsquo; because the latter word carried too much of baggage. There many ways to undertake a linguistic reform. For instance, the members of this board could restrict the meaning and reference of the word \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo;: \u0026ldquo;that which exists in India\u0026rdquo;. If we use the word thus, of course, no one denies that Hinduism exists. Or again, we could say \u0026ldquo;that which is common to many different groups in India and to Indians elsewhere\u0026rdquo;. Ascertaining the scope of this word might be difficult, but we could get along.\nHowever, the problem is that when we enter the intellectual arena, our definition of the word is not the only one floating around. So, either we have such discussions (such a discussion appears interminable) each time, or we go for some other term which does not create confusions and muddles because it carries unidentified ontological and epistemological commitments.\nWhen I say that \u0026ldquo;Hinduism is an imaginary entity\u0026rdquo;, I mean the following (as I have repeatedly said in \u0026lsquo;The Heathen\u0026hellip;\u0026rsquo;): If the word \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; is said to refer to a religion, and the claim is that such a religion exists (say, in India), then such a claim is false. In order to defend my position, I do not depend on my pet definition of the word \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; but on a hypothesis about what religion is, how to study it scientifically and so on. On the basis of this hypothesis, I enumerate the sociological conditions that are absolutely essential for the propagation of religion and show that they are systematically absent in India. I also show that a closer (and more detailed) study would also allow us to argue that it is metaphysically impossible that religion could exist in India.\nIn the same book, I address myself to the intuition that religion is somehow responsible for either the emergence of a culture or for its identity. My hypothesis suggests that this intuition is true for the western culture but that human history is not European history writ large. Even here, the way I make this intuition come out \u0026rsquo;true\u0026rsquo; is to show that societies and cultures do not come into being because some groups have a religion (the empirical history of religions shows that religions divide people more often than it unites them) or because some people practice some or another set of rituals. I speak in terms of configurations of learning and what brings them into existence.\nThe usefulness of a linguistic reform should be ascertained by looking at the advantages it brings. (In my book, I do not indulge in linguistic reform concerning the word \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; but in formulating a set of hypothesis about religion, culture and configurations of learning. These hypotheses can be tested, rejected, improved upon, etc. on theoretical and empirical grounds.) I suggest that we better look at the Indian culture in terms of a configuration of learning that brings forth practical knowledge. (I need to correct you here: the ritualization of daily life in Asia is an evidence for the claim that Ritual plays the role in Asia that Religion plays regarding the West. I do not substitute \u0026lsquo;ritualized culture\u0026rsquo; for \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo;.)\nIn the context of my theory, one cannot formulate the question \u0026lsquo;If Hinduism is not a religion, what else is it?\u0026rsquo; (That is because, I have avoided defining the word \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; and my hypothesis works at a very different level. I speak of \u0026lsquo;Religion\u0026rsquo; that develops a configuration of learning. So, if we write a history of the Western Culture, only then do we need to look at Christianity as a religion.) You could, of course, raise it as an issue in order to understand the import of my theory. (Or you could raise it to ask the question, \u0026lsquo;How do we write a history of India, or Asia?\u0026rsquo;)\nLet me repeat. I am not replacing the word \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; with the word \u0026lsquo;culture\u0026rsquo; (Indian, Asian, ritualized or whatever else). I formulate a hypothesis, which differentiates the Indian (or Asian) culture from the Western culture. Zillions of new questions come into being because of this hypothesis. I do not have answers to all, or even to most of them. For instance, since writing \u0026lsquo;The heathen\u0026hellip;\u0026rsquo;, I have taken the first step in beginning to theorize about the nature of Indian traditions; about how we could start making sense of the \u0026lsquo;Indianness\u0026rsquo; (I do not like to use this word, but I cannot think of better one) of the Indian traditions. I have some understanding of the nature of Indian ethics and how it is different from the structure of Western ethics. I have some idea too why we have such great difficulties in either understanding or testing the kind of hypothesis I formulate, etc. But these are all mere steps in the direction of a goal, which no one individual or even one generation can reach.\nOne says: \u0026ldquo;if one abandons the notion of a something (not religion) called Hinduism, I think it is difficult to understand connections between say, a Vedicist and a Sikh or a Jain or a Buddhist monk.\u0026rdquo; The proof of the pudding is in the eating, they say. May be you are right; then again, maybe you are not. So far I have been able to make better sense of what unites the kind of people you mention without using the word \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; or any of its dominant meanings. Not only that. My hypothesis is cognitively superior to every other \u0026rsquo;theory\u0026rsquo; in the market place that does use some or another meaning of the word \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo;. So far, I have dispensed with the word \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; itself: I am using words like \u0026rsquo;experiential knowledge\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;practical or performative knowledge\u0026rsquo; (no doubt, I will need to coin more new words) to build a testable hypothesis about the Indian culture. All I do observe is that those millions of writers who do use the word \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; are not able to generate any kind of a hypothesis that can be tested. These writers stretch over three centuries and embrace intellectuals from both the West and the East. Of course, observing their failure does not mean that they will also continue to fail. But this possibility does not bother me. I have multiple criteria of scientificity and rationality to guide me in my endeavor. Let us see where my search takes me. I know where their search has so far taken them.\n","tags":["hipkapi"],"title":"Ontological and epistemological commitments of ‘Hinduism’—S.N.Balagangadhara","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/ontological-and-epistemological-commitments-of-hinduism-s-n-balagangadhara/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara"],"content":" Let me focus on the citation \u0026ldquo;Ours is the true religion because, above all, it\u0026hellip;stands up\u0026hellip; to tell and to declare to the nations who are mere children of yesterday in comparison with us Hindus - who own the hoary antiquity of the wisdom, discovered by our ancestors here in India.\u0026rdquo;\nTwo things are striking in this citation: the \u0026ldquo;truth\u0026rdquo; of a religion is directly linked to its \u0026ldquo;antiquity\u0026rdquo; and to its \u0026ldquo;wisdom\u0026rdquo;.\nWhat is \u0026ldquo;religion\u0026rdquo; to Vivekananda here? Clearly, not every piece of wisdom is religious because it is wise. (For instance, Polonius\u0026rsquo; advice to his son, though wise, would not be seen by Vivekananda as a part of religion. That is, nowhere does he consider Shakespeare as a \u0026ldquo;religious\u0026rdquo; sage.)\nAs Vivekananda sees it, \u0026ldquo;religious wisdom\u0026rdquo; is obviously tied to its antiquity. The issue is: what has antiquity to do with either \u0026ldquo;religious wisdom\u0026rdquo; or its \u0026ldquo;truth\u0026rdquo;? When it comes to knowledge, antiquity is no guarantee for its truth: we do not say that Plato found the \u0026ldquo;truth\u0026rdquo; because he wrote 2000 years ago, do we? (I presume that Vivekananda also knew this.) Galileo\u0026rsquo;s theory is not \u0026ldquo;true\u0026rdquo; because he came centuries before Einstein. In other words, Vivekananda turns our normal stance with respect to knowledge and wisdom completely around, when he talks about religion: other nations are children compared to the Hindus, he says, and this matters to the issue at hand. The antiquity somehow testifies to \u0026ldquo;religious\u0026rdquo; truth. Question: what was Vivekananda\u0026rsquo;s notion regarding \u0026ldquo;truth\u0026rdquo; here?\nThere is also a third issue to the theme. One of the striking things about the Indian traditions is this: (a) on the one hand, there is the refrain that \u0026ldquo;all religions are true\u0026rdquo;; (b) on the other hand, there is also the constant debate and polemic between the different traditions as to which of these was \u0026ldquo;better\u0026rdquo;. Vivekananda, as a child of his tradition, was no better.\nJust as an example, consider his approving citation of Narada in Volume 3 regarding Bhakti: \u0026ldquo;Bhakti is greater than karma, greater than Yoga, because these are intended for an object in view, while Bhakti is its own fruition, its own means and its own end.\u0026rdquo; This means that claiming that \u0026ldquo;all religions are true\u0026rdquo; does not entail the claim that \u0026ldquo;all religions are equal\u0026rdquo;. Some are obviously better (or more superior) than others. The history of the Indian traditions provides ample evidence for this stance. Consequently, it follows that, in the context of the Indian traditions and culture, the claim \u0026ldquo;all religions are true\u0026rdquo; cannot possibly mean what my respected colleagues think it ought to mean, viz., all religions are equal. This observation merely reinforces the suggestion that the link between \u0026ldquo;religion\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;truth\u0026rdquo; (asthe Indian traditions see both) is not quite the same as our twenty-first century interpretations.\nConsequently, it appears that the onus of proof lies on my respected colleagues to show either that (a) all Indian traditions are \u0026ldquo;ethnocentrically jingoistic\u0026rdquo; or (b) that Vivekananda was that or (c) both. Citations from Vivekananda do not settle the issue one way or another. What are at stake are our interpretations. May I look forward to illuminating (and non ad hoc) arguments about (i) what Vivekananda\u0026rsquo;s notion of \u0026ldquo;religion\u0026rdquo; was; (ii) what his notion of \u0026ldquo;truth\u0026rdquo; was; (iii) how the claim that \u0026ldquo;all religions are true\u0026rdquo; entails the claim that some \u0026ldquo;religion\u0026rdquo; cannot be better than the other?\n","tags":[],"title":"Antiquity and ‘religious wisdom’","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/antiquity-and-religious-wisdom/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","belief","translation","sat(asat)"],"content":"To take German language, let us look at how Heidegger talks about \u0026lsquo;being\u0026rsquo;: there is the \u0026lsquo;big Being\u0026rsquo; (\u0026lsquo;Sein\u0026rsquo;) and there is the \u0026lsquo;small being\u0026rsquo; (\u0026lsquo;Dasein\u0026rsquo; meaning \u0026rsquo;there-being\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;so-being\u0026rsquo;). And then there is \u0026lsquo;Sein\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;Seindes\u0026rsquo;. All these are translated by the word \u0026lsquo;being\u0026rsquo;.\nTo jump back a couple of hundred years, and pick up another philosopher with the same alphabet and the same language, we have G.W.F. Hegel. His \u0026lsquo;Sein\u0026rsquo; of course has nothing to do with the \u0026lsquo;Sein\u0026rsquo; of Heidegger, even though both are translated as \u0026lsquo;Being\u0026rsquo; with a big B. So, even in one language, there are problems with respect to translating words into another language.\nThe post-world war English (and the formal logic of the twentieth century) assures us that \u0026lsquo;being\u0026rsquo; is a synonym for \u0026rsquo;existence\u0026rsquo;: if something has a being, it exists. Were we to use the word \u0026lsquo;being\u0026rsquo; in this sense, then quite obviously \u0026lsquo;sat\u0026rsquo; cannot mean \u0026lsquo;being\u0026rsquo;.

But \u0026lsquo;maya\u0026rsquo; is \u0026lsquo;asat\u0026rsquo;.\nThe ontological and philosophical assumptions of the English language into which one translates a word from another language and culture should make one wary of making bold claims. No study of any Sanskrit verb (from 11th century CE) can ever tell what that word means in English in the 21st century. The issue is not about Sanskrit verbs but what they mean in the English language of today. However, if one insists \u0026lsquo;sat\u0026rsquo; in Sanskrit has the intension as \u0026rsquo;to be\u0026rsquo; in English, then, it follows that \u0026lsquo;Sat\u0026rsquo; functions as an existential quantifier (\u0026rsquo;to be\u0026rsquo;, in modern English, is to be the value of a variable.), which it clearly does not. Before one can say \u0026lsquo;sat\u0026rsquo; is \u0026ldquo;\u0026rsquo;to be in the sense of \u0026rsquo;to exist\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;, one needs to know the intensions of the words \u0026rsquo;to be\u0026rsquo; and \u0026rsquo;to exist\u0026rsquo;. Since you make a distinction between \u0026rsquo;to be\u0026rsquo; and \u0026rsquo;to exist\u0026rsquo;, may I know what these two words mean? What is their ontological and philosophical import?\nI suggest that deeper investigation is required into language and philosophy before coming up with claims that \u0026lsquo;sat\u0026rsquo; is \u0026lsquo;being\u0026rsquo;.\n","tags":[],"title":"Is ‘sat’ ‘being’?

The West claims that it liberated itself from the dogmas of the Christian religion in this Enlightenment, and those who call themselves atheists mean by this that they belong to the enlightened people who \u0026ldquo;have escaped from the dogmatic illusions of religion.\u0026rdquo; Now, as it has always done, Christian Europe simply identified its own history with human history in general, and it claimed that all cultures had so far been under the ignorant spell of religion, but that they could now be liberated by the Enlightened West. This claim needs two separate premises: (a) That all cultures have religion (b) That atheism was a new and rational system of beliefs that could liberate people from all cultures from this illusion of religion.\nNow we come to what Balagangadhara claims in his \u0026lsquo;The Heathen in His Blindness \u0026hellip;\u0026rsquo;, and what I consider to be a much better description of the current state of western affairs. The Enlightenment was not a liberation from the Christian religion at all. Atheism as it developed during the last few centuries in the West is nothing but one of the results of the dynamic of secularization that is intrinsic to Christianity. As Balagangadhara has explained, there are two horns in the Christological dilemma, and one horn gives rise to a dynamic within the Christian religion in which it tries to cast off its recognizably Christian features. That is, throughout the development of the western culture, Christianity has simply tried to dechristianize itself. One of the moments within this dynamic was that of theism and deism in which the emphasis shifted from Christ to God - as the creator and sovereign of the universe. Now, the next obvious step for the western culture was to dispose of this God and declare the advent of atheism. As we are slowly finding out, however, this so-called atheism of the western culture is but a theism in disguise. This is why I say that atheists are Christian theists in disguise. Their moral and political philosophy, their psychology and sociology, their anthropology, etc. all consist of accounts that make sense only if one accepts a number of deeply Christian assumptions.\nOne of these so-called secular accounts that are in fact Christian is the belief that all cultures have a religion. It is simply a secularization of the Christian belief that the biblical God gave religion to humankind, which was transformed into the assumption that religion is a cultural universal during the Enlightenment. This pre-theoretical assumption precedes all empirical research and theory-formation on religion and culture. From the early missionaries to the contemporary anthropologists, no one has ever even doubted that the phenomenon of religion is universal to all cultures. All psychological and sociological and even biological and neurological explanations of religion take this pre-theoretical Christian theological assumption as a starting point. Now, this is hardly scientific, isn\u0026rsquo;t it? In his book, Balagangadhara shows that the belief that all cultures have religion has more to do with the structure of the Christian religion than with the nature of human cultures. Furthermore, he develops a theory of religion which reveals that Christianity, Islam, and Judaism are at present the only instances of the phenomenon of religion. On top of that, he shows why those belonging to these religions and to the cultures they have created, are deeply inclined to believe that all human cultures must have a religion or at least a world view. The latter belief in the universality of religion is not a scientific hypothesis at all, but a religious doctrine. He also shows that the pagan traditions have a structure that is completely different from that of these three religions. In other words, the Semitic religions and the pagan traditions are not variants of the same supposedly universal phenomenon of religion, rather they are different phenomena.\nBalagangadhara\u0026rsquo;s theory first of all shows us that there is no such thing as pagan religion. There are pagan cultural traditions but these are completely different from the religions of Christianity, Islam and Judaism. One of the differences is that belief in general and belief in God in particular are central to the latter, while they are utterly irrelevant to the former. Although even the intellectuals of the pagan cultures have today learned to speak in the language of secularized Christian theology, they are simply wrong when they say that there is a religion of Hinduism which revolves around a belief in Shiva, Vishnu, Brahma, or the entire Hindu pantheon. Admittedly, in the Hindu traditions, there are many stories about these devas and many pujas are related to them, but it does not even make sense to ask the question \u0026ldquo;do you believe in Shiva (or any other pagan \u0026lsquo;god\u0026rsquo;)?\u0026rdquo; to a Hindu or a pagan in general, like you would ask the question \u0026ldquo;do you believe in God\u0026rdquo; to a Christian, a Muslim or a Jew. Therefore, when you call those who say \u0026rsquo;no\u0026rsquo; to the latter question \u0026lsquo;atheists\u0026rsquo;, and this is how we have learned to use the word, it does not at all make sense to designate someone who is no longer practicing any of the pagan traditions as \u0026lsquo;an atheist\u0026rsquo;. This is not even an intelligible proposition, from the perspective of the pagan traditions.\nThe proposition \u0026lsquo;X is an atheist\u0026rsquo; would be intelligible if and only if you are willing to accept the following assumptions: (a) The modern western culture is the climax of human evolution; (b) The Enlightenment truly liberated the West from the illusions of religion, and brought it to the rationality of atheism; (c) This atheism also offers the possibility of rational liberation to the followers of other cultures, which are all under the spell of religion; (d) By not participating in the practices of the pagan tradition you stem from, you have been liberated from religion by the rationality of modern western atheism. As these are all secularized Christian assumptions, accepting them would simply make you into a Christian theist in disguise.\nThe other option is to take Balagangadhara\u0026rsquo;s scientific conclusions seriously. Then it is clear that the pagan traditions do not revolve around belief in God or gods or any entity. They do not revolve around belief or doctrine in general, and therefore truth claims are absent in the pagan traditions. Thus, a claim like \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not on any \u0026lsquo;quest for truth\u0026rsquo;. I simply feel quite happy and satisfied with the fact that I happened to be living here on Earth at a time when there is such a vast amount of knowledge available that helps me in answering practically all the important questions that I have,\u0026rdquo; illustrates a typically pagan attitude.\nIn many pagan cultures, including the Ancient Roman and the Indian, there were streams of thinking that simply denied the existence of the pantheon of gods or devas. These groups were not systematically persecuted or harassed, but most of the time they were accepted as merely another avenue in the human quest for truth.\nComments Mitch — 2016-06-05 09:04:14\nThis article makes very little sense. It is directly contradicted by history and modern sociology. Let\u0026rsquo;s count the ways:\n1: Atheism has existed for as long as religion has. Ever since the first caveman said \u0026ldquo;Big Og in sky say no kill other tribe members,\u0026rdquo; someone has responded with \u0026ldquo;Got any evidence for that?\u0026rdquo;\n2: \u0026ldquo;The West\u0026rdquo; as an entity does not exist. Never has. Don\u0026rsquo;t invent entities.\n3: While christians and certain other religions often claim that all cultures and individuals have religion, atheists tend to reject this notion. Asserting otherwise makes you wrong.\n4: Atheism is the state of having listened to claims about gods and said \u0026ldquo;that doesn\u0026rsquo;t make any sense, got any evidence to back it up?\u0026rdquo; Nothing more.\nThe rest of this is nonsensical rambling praising the uninformed babbling of someone who clearly has no idea what they\u0026rsquo;re talking about.\n","tags":[],"title":"Atheism: a secularized theism—Jakob de Roover","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/atheism-a-secularized-theism-jakob-de-roover/"},{"categories":["Christianity","Jakob"],"content":"The logical steps that inevitably make the claim that God revealed His Will in Jesus Christ into an unconditional and exclusive truth claim are fairly simple:\n(a) Christianity says that the universe was created by God, and that this universe is the perfect embodiment of His will or plan;\n(b) Furthermore, it claims that this God has revealed His Will to humankind, and that this revelation is the Christian doctrine as it is \u0026rsquo;embodied\u0026rsquo; in Jesus Christ;\n(c) This Divine Will is governing the entire universe including humankind, i.e., it governs everything that has ever existed, that exists, and that will exist;\nFrom (b) and (c) it follows (d) that the Christian doctrine must claim a universal and unconditional truth as the revelation of God.\nWhy? Well, firstly, there can only be ONE WILL that truly governs the entire universe. Secondly, there can only be ONE TRUE DOCTRINE that conveys this one will to the humankind. Therefore, this doctrine MUST BE intolerant towards all traditions it sees as rivaling doctrines that convey the will or plan of God. As I said, it has to construe these doctrinal rivals either as the corruptions of the devil of the true doctrine in the worst case or as pale and erring variants of its own doctrine (which might contain some \u0026lsquo;rays of light\u0026rsquo;, that is, traces of divine revelation) in the best case. From this, we can conclude (1) that Christianity cannot but be intolerant towards the traditions it construes as religious rivals, and (2) that Christianity has an intrinsic drive to spread its doctrine among those who are not yet aware that God has completed His revelation in Jesus Christ. This either/or zero sum game characterizes Christianity and its monotheistic rivals, Judaism and Islam. As I said, when you negate this exclusive aspect, you simply deny that Christianity is the message in which God reveals His plan for the universe, and that would amount to a denial of the existence of Christianity itself. Exclusivity or self-denial are the only two options for Christianity, whether Eastern or Western, Protestant or Catholic, Orthodox or Baptist, Pentecostal or Seventh-Day Adventist. This is not because of historical developments, but because of the intrinsic structure of the Christian religion (Please see Balagangadhara\u0026rsquo;s book for further explanation).\n","tags":[],"title":"What makes Christianity a religion?

Such texts do not easily lend themselves to a discussion regarding the steps taken in developing a stand point, unlike, say, a mathematical proof or a philosophical argument. Of course, I do not find such texts \u0026lsquo;irrational\u0026rsquo;.\nOne possibility is that you do not expect to encounter such emotions in a rational discussion between two intellectuals. While you would be right on this score up to a point, please reflect on the possibility that you are circumscribing \u0026lsquo;rationality\u0026rsquo; very narrowly: in such a circumscription, \u0026lsquo;rhetorics\u0026rsquo; would not be considered \u0026lsquo;rational\u0026rsquo; any more than discussions involving a combination of what we Indians call \u0026lsquo;rasa\u0026rsquo;. Taunts and teasing, humor and irony, sarcasm and ridicule, are as much parts of a rhetorical text as are praise and laudations. That is why I did not make the remark that Hogan\u0026rsquo;s text was a laudatio but used that character of his text to enter into a \u0026lsquo;discussion\u0026rsquo;, which, I admit, failed.\nThe idea that scientific theories should not use rhetorical strategies is something that no intellectual who knows anything about the relevant domains accepts.

I am glad too that you put across some thoughtful considerations without being polemical, and that can only help generate a stimulating discussion among all the concerned parties. However, the way you frame your points make the task an exercise in walking on a tight rope.\n(1) \u0026ldquo;Anyone who cares about Hinduism or Indic traditions should be grateful to Wendy Doniger\u0026rdquo; you say. Well, I am not sure I care much about \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo;, but I definitely do care about the Indian traditions, which includes \u0026lsquo;Indic traditions\u0026rsquo; as their subset. I have read a few works of Wendy; I have bought many more which I will not read; and, I am sure, I am not going to buy any more. I want to reflect aloud why, and solicit your arguments. Before I do so, a few more preliminary points need to be dealt with.\n(2) Because it is about the intellectual contributions of Wendy Doniger, I have to pass (for the time being) on some of the provocative remarks you make about the Gita. In all honesty, I would have much preferred to engage you on these points because they are far more substantial than any of the ten reasons you provide while pleading the case that you do.\n(3) In other words, while admitting that you indeed have provided ten reasons, permit me to engage with you (within the confines of a tight rope) on the issue whether they are good reasons as well.\nLet me take first take the title of your contribution literally to see whether, cognitively speaking, I should be grateful to Wendy Doniger and, if so, which of the ten considerations count as candidates.\nHer formidable scholarship. Not knowing Wendy personally, I am quite willing to grant her everything you say. (This includes hyperboles like \u0026ldquo;her command of the Puranas may be unparalleled\u0026rdquo;. Acceptable as a form of defense, but quite unconvincing: I do not believe she can hold a candle to my mother\u0026rsquo;s knowledge of the Puranas. Of course, there is no way either of us could argue this case, especially given that my mother is dead. But I will not take you up on these kinds of issues.) Need I be grateful to Wendy for that? We have indeed come a long way in the academy if we have to be grateful to people that their learned discourses presuppose scholarship (not ignorance). I cannot imagine me having to be grateful to a physicist because he knows the relevant material in his domain. This is a conditio sine qua non for talking Patrick, not something to be grateful about! But that you find it important enough to be a \u0026lsquo;reason\u0026rsquo; might tell us something about the nature of scholarship about India hitherto: many who did speak were illiterate in the subject matter. If such is (was?) the case, compared to them, Wendy could really exhibit a scholarship that is truly formidable. But then remember, it is defined relative to illiteracy. How does the saying go again? \u0026lsquo;In the land of the blind…\u0026rsquo; In other words, a reason it might be for one to be grateful to Wendy but a good reason it certainly is not.\nHer command of language next. Should one know Sanskrit in order to talk about the Indic traditions? Well yes, if one does philology but not otherwise. One could build sociological, psychological, economic etc. explanations about Indic traditions without being a philologist. Even here, a qualification requires to be made. One could develop a hypothesis about the natural languages, and even more specifically about Sanskrit, without knowing Sanskrit. The sanskritists could provide one with facts that might \u0026lsquo;confirm\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;falsify\u0026rsquo; one\u0026rsquo;s hypothesis; but there is no good reason why the one who makes the hypothesis needs to know Sanskrit as well. If you grant me this, from this it follows that one would make a perfect ass of oneself by entering into a philological discussion about Sanskrit without knowing Sanskrit philology. To the extent you say she knows Sanskrit, I take your word for it, to that extent she is doing something one should take for granted. (See my considerations above.) Thus, it appears to me, her philological knowledge is no good reason for me to be grateful to her either. It is like saying one should be grateful to Greek philologists that they know Greek! \u0026ldquo;Where would the English or American reader be without Doniger\u0026rsquo;s masterful translation of Manusmrti, her beautiful selection of Hindu myths, her uncompromising translation of the Rig Veda (which, as she explains, tries to preserve the raggedness of some parts of the original) \u0026ndash; not to mention her glorious rendering of the Oresteia?\u0026rdquo; you ask. Permit me a deflationary answer: where they are not today. You need to show that where they are today is better than where they would have been, if your rhetorical passage is to have some bite. That you have not.\nYour third reason why she deserves my gratitude lies in her interpretative acumen. The first aspect concerns her philological ability. I will accept this for what it is worth. But your second aspect, it appears to me, is extraordinary to say the least. Here is what you say: \u0026ldquo;Doniger works in the Structuralist tradition according to which it is crucial to read as many variants of a myth as possible. The variants form a transformation set which gives the interpreter a way of discerning fundamental principles of the culture that produced, sustained, and varied these myths.\u0026rdquo; The first sentence tells us about the tradition in which Doniger works; the second amplifies what that tradition is about. From this one has to conclude that her acumen resides in her choice for the structuralist tradition. There are many points to be made about this; therefore, I will choose what I consider important. (I can always add other points if and when our discussion takes of.)\nSuppose that I want to understand the western culture. So, I read many variants of the Bible, the Biblical myths and I arrive at this \u0026rsquo;transformation set\u0026rsquo; that you speak of. Tell me, Patrick, how this helps me in \u0026lsquo;discerning the fundamental principles\u0026rsquo; of the western culture that \u0026lsquo;produced, sustained and varied these myths.\u0026rsquo; What fundamental principles has this structuralist tradition excavated about the \u0026lsquo;western culture\u0026rsquo; that they enable me to understand (in whatever sense of the word) the western culture? What do I understand about the Western culture (at any period in its history) by reading the Four Gospels? (After all, they are four variants of the same myth.)\nWhat should one say about the \u0026lsquo;acumen\u0026rsquo;, which reads the \u0026lsquo;variants\u0026rsquo; of some Indian myths and makes pronouncements about the \u0026lsquo;fundamental principles\u0026rsquo; of a culture? It does not, I am afraid, tell me anything positive about this acumen, except that it is pompous, pretentious and stupid.\nAm I to be grateful that Wendy propagates this nonsense? Am I to assume that the \u0026lsquo;where the British and the American reader\u0026rsquo; today is, is better than where they would have been without this \u0026lsquo;deep insight\u0026rsquo;? Forgive me Patrick, I do not see any reason for expressing my gratitude to Wendy for this phenomenal achievement.\nNow, of course, you do not say that the \u0026rsquo;transformation set\u0026rsquo; gives one the insights into the fundamental principles of a culture but that it merely provides the interpreter \u0026lsquo;a way\u0026rsquo;. In this form, it is hardly worth talking about and I am surprised you consider it as a reason to be grateful to Wendy. In exactly the same sense, one could claim that eating Idli\u0026rsquo;s is also a \u0026lsquo;way\u0026rsquo; for an interpreter to gain insights into the \u0026lsquo;fundamental principles\u0026rsquo; of a culture. How can one discuss this, unless one also says what that way consists of?\nYour subsequent passage about what the demagogue does, the presence of diversity in a tradition, the fact that a tradition is not \u0026lsquo;univocal\u0026rsquo;, etc. is an important one but, alas, betrays the absence of an insight into the nature of political and social movements. Clearly, you are targeting the current \u0026lsquo;Hindutva\u0026rsquo; rage in India. I join you in expressing my abhorrence towards any virulent ideology. But I must say, I did not need a Wendy or the structuralist tradition to do this. To the extent the \u0026lsquo;British and the American reader\u0026rsquo; requires a Wendy to come to this insight, to that extent I can only express my regrets at what has become of modern education in Britain and America. One would expect a sounder understanding of sociology, history and politics from students belonging to such advanced nations as Britain and America.\nAbout using the psychoanalytic principles to understand the \u0026lsquo;profundity\u0026rsquo; of the ancient myths. I am sure many others will want to engage you on this; so I will just make one remark. The \u0026lsquo;profundity\u0026rsquo; of one is the \u0026lsquo;vulgarity\u0026rsquo; of the other: you will need to do more than hand waving in the direction \u0026ldquo;deep human feelings\u0026rdquo; to convince me of the \u0026lsquo;acumen\u0026rsquo; in this case.\nLet me go to the fourth reason for gratitude. It resides in the \u0026lsquo;universalism\u0026rsquo; of Wendy, you say. It is quite unclear what precisely this universalism is. On the one hand, (a) it appears to be about appreciating the existence of \u0026ldquo;significant cross-cultural patterns in myth\u0026rdquo;; (b) at the same time, this recurring \u0026lsquo;pattern\u0026rsquo; is supposed to be legacy of Structuralism and is related to the presence of something like a universal cognitive structure. On the other hand, the paragraphs are also about (c) the \u0026lsquo;contradictory\u0026rsquo; threads within the Indian traditions; and, all of a sudden (d) affirmations of universalism and pacifism seem to become the trademarks of Wendy Doniger. While understandable in rhetorical texts, such transitions without clear focus or arguments make discussions extremely difficult. So, I will have to take a guess about the reasons for gratitude. By highlighting the \u0026lsquo;ambivalences\u0026rsquo; in the Indian traditions, Wendy\u0026rsquo;s contributions can prevent people from fighting those hijackers of Indian traditions who emphasize the \u0026lsquo;militaristic\u0026rsquo;, divisive threads within the Indian traditions. If this is what you want to say, I am appalled. (If you want to say something else, I wish you would spell it put more clearly.) Are you serious Patrick? Those who have to fight \u0026lsquo;divisive\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;militaristic\u0026rsquo; tendencies within India are in India. Most of them cannot speak English; hardly any has heard of Wendy. Should they be grateful for Wendy? I am sure you do not mean anything as silly as this.\nPerhaps you refer to the Indians living in \u0026lsquo;Britain and America\u0026rsquo;. Mutatis mutandis, the same consideration holds good here too: they may speak English, but most have never heard of a Wendy. In fact, one of the oft heard reactions to Rajiv Malhotra\u0026rsquo;s column (from Indians both in India and elsewhere) was one of shock: they did not know either about Wendy or about her contributions.\nSo, who are you referring to? The \u0026lsquo;British and American reader\u0026rsquo;, whose only knowledge of India comes from Wendy\u0026rsquo;s books? Are you suggesting that these readers are sophisticated enough to understand Wendy\u0026rsquo;s psychoanalytical jargon and yet so stupid that they would not know that cultures always exhibit internal varieties and diversities, and that peace is \u0026lsquo;good\u0026rsquo; and war is \u0026lsquo;bad\u0026rsquo; without Wendy\u0026rsquo;s help? Really! Who is conning whom here?\nIn short, whatever \u0026lsquo;universalism\u0026rsquo; it is that you talk about, it is not clear at all why I should be grateful to Wendy Doniger.\nThe fifth reason is Wendy\u0026rsquo;s sensitivity to cultural specificity. What does that consist of? You suggest two aspects: one which is not about Wendy but what Ashish Nanady claims and what you say \u0026lsquo;Hindu\u0026rsquo; nationalism is; the second is her conviction that \u0026ldquo;it is impossible to understand Hinduism fully without understanding its close interconnection with Islam. In keeping with this, Doniger has detailed familiarity with the Qur\u0026rsquo;an and Islamic traditions.\u0026rdquo; I will, correspondingly, skip the first aspect (in this post). I can always come back to it, if you (or other readers) find it important. Let me, therefore, go to the second aspect. Again, I am surprised. This time at what you possibly think cultural \u0026lsquo;specificity\u0026rsquo; is. In so far as you want to engage in a polemic with your understanding of \u0026lsquo;Hindutva\u0026rsquo;, I am willing to even endorse this claim and fight alongside you. But that is not what we are doing now. We are meeting each other as intellectuals in a public arena. While simplifications and vulgarized presentations are necessary to reach a wider public than the academics, surely, one should not become simplistic in this process. The issue of cultural specificity, of India for instance, involves a question like the following: \u0026ldquo;What makes the Indian culture different from, say, the western culture, the African culture…\u0026rdquo; The answer will explicate the notion of cultural specificity. If Wendy Doniger\u0026rsquo;s writings explicate the cultural specificity of India, I would definitely be grateful to her. To say that to understand Hinduism \u0026lsquo;fully\u0026rsquo; (whatever a \u0026lsquo;full understanding\u0026rsquo; might mean here) one has to understand its \u0026lsquo;close\u0026rsquo; (as in only the \u0026lsquo;close\u0026rsquo; ones? Or as against \u0026lsquo;distant\u0026rsquo; ones?) \u0026lsquo;interconnections\u0026rsquo; with Islam (would one way influence like, for example, the influence of \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; on Islam in India be needed to a \u0026lsquo;full\u0026rsquo; understanding of \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; or do they have to be \u0026lsquo;interconnections\u0026rsquo;?) is to say, as indicated in the parenthetical remarks, pretty much. But none of them, unfortunately, help one understand the \u0026lsquo;specificity\u0026rsquo; of the Indian culture.\nBesides, while understanding \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; might help one to understand a part of the Indian culture, I am sure you are not suggesting the preposterous idea that understanding \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; is the same as understanding the Indian culture!\nSo, what is there to be grateful to Wendy in this issue? Nothing, I am afraid.\nHer intellectual openness. You say that she is always \u0026ldquo;anxious to open genuinely scholarly dialogue\u0026rdquo;. It is a necessary and desirable property in any intellectual. I do hope that she will exhibit this virtue (that you attribute to her) by responding in a positive fashion to the genuine issues that Rajiv Malhotra has raised in his column on this very board. If I remember rightly, in the ensuing discussion, someone raised the question what Wendy\u0026rsquo;s response to Rajiv Malhotra\u0026rsquo;s column was. His reply at that stage was, again if I remember rightly, that Wendy had not responded. Perhaps, you could persuade Wendy to have a dialogue with all the involved parties. That would definitely convince me and others, and if she were to do that, she would definitely deserve my gratitude. (Not a special gratitude, but one which I owe to every intellectual who is open.)\nThe seventh reason you give is that she has (a) popularized \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; in the English speaking world; and that (b) this view of \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; has been \u0026ldquo;complex and subtle\u0026rdquo;. I agree with you regarding the first point. But a simple \u0026lsquo;popularization\u0026rsquo; does not deserve gratitude of course. In and of itself, popularization is a tricky notion: we need to ask what has been popularized, and whether it is worth popularization and so on. Consequently, let us look at (b). You say that her view is complex and subtle. You would be right about the \u0026lsquo;complexity\u0026rsquo; of her view. Indeed, to popularize a \u0026lsquo;complex\u0026rsquo; view does call for special abilities. While willing to acknowledge this (with some reservations), I am not sure there is agreement that this view has also been \u0026lsquo;subtle\u0026rsquo;. What would a \u0026lsquo;subtle\u0026rsquo; view of \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; be? That depends, of course, on what the contrast set is. You summarize it thus: \u0026ldquo;she has tried to avoid the dichotomous options offered by colonialism\u0026rdquo;. You see these options as \u0026ldquo;the two strains of colonialist Orientalism \u0026ndash; the denigrating strain that sees Indic traditions as degraded, and the romanticizing strain that sees Indic traditions as a source of pure spiritual light\u0026rdquo; and further detect them in Modern India as well.\nI am going to read you the following way: you are not saying that Wendy is per se against \u0026lsquo;dichotomies\u0026rsquo; (as though a monism or a trichotomy would be a better option) but against the two strains of what you call \u0026lsquo;colonialist Orientalism\u0026rsquo;. This is, of course, a good thing. But how has she done this? You make the following remark in your fourth reason: \u0026ldquo;Doniger emphasizes, and clearly prefers, the pacifistic strain. I consider it one of Doniger\u0026rsquo;s great services to Hinduism.\u0026rdquo; Surely, preferring one strain that lives within the Indian tradition (doing so with reference to other living strands within the same tradition) is not the same as propagating a \u0026lsquo;complex and subtle view of Hinduism\u0026rsquo;. On the basis of this, it would appear to me that one would say she has popularized a partial view of … what? Of \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; or of \u0026lsquo;Indic traditions\u0026rsquo;? (It looks as though I was hasty in my earlier post and erred on the side of generosity. It appears that Indic traditions and Hinduism are coextensive in this case after all. But this does not matter for the moment.)\nYou say, \u0026ldquo;Doniger has bravely tried to see Indic traditions as human, as manifestations of psychology and culture, like any other tradition.\u0026rdquo; Should one take these statements seriously or not? I mean, which fool would say that the \u0026lsquo;Indic tradition\u0026rsquo; is not \u0026ldquo;human\u0026rdquo; and that it is not a manifestation of \u0026ldquo;psychology and culture\u0026rdquo; of such humans? What is so brave in insisting on a banal point that no one disagrees with? However, it is comforting to know that Indic traditions are the expressions of the Indian people, their psychology and culture. It is nice too to know that, in this respect, they are \u0026ldquo;like any other tradition\u0026rdquo;.\nAs you can see, it is again difficult to find out what one should be grateful about. Nevertheless, a charitable interpretation could be: the \u0026lsquo;British and the American reader\u0026rsquo; should be grateful that Wendy has made \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; popular. If you look at the discussion generated on the Sulekha board, I have the impression that the jury is still out on the issue whether one should be grateful or not.\nYet, I am perfectly willing, if you are willing to be less hyperbolic, to accept that the interest in \u0026lsquo;Indology\u0026rsquo; (in America at least) owes a lot to Wendy Doniger. For this achievement, irrespective of whether she is right or wrong, she definitely is owed gratitude by anyone who cares for the Indic traditions. I do: therefore, I do appreciate the enormous effort she has put in.\nIn fact, as I understand the issue, this is the reason for Rajiv Malhotra\u0026rsquo;s article. Not to slander Wendy Doniger but to invite her to have a dialogue with the Indian \u0026lsquo;Diaspora\u0026rsquo; (amongst others). The invitation arises through recognition of her extraordinary role in the development of Indology in the United States and out of a genuine appreciation for her efforts.\nIn other words, I am willing to go along with this reason.\n\u0026ldquo;She also tries to avoid the options offered by reactions to colonialism\u0026ndash;the unthinking adulation of the west, and the rigid assertion of a dogmatic and inviolable indigeneity\u0026ndash;an assertion almost always based on stereotypes\u0026rdquo;, you say. I must say that you surprise me once again. As a cognitive scientist, surely you should know better than to talk about \u0026lsquo;stereotypes\u0026rsquo; in this way. This is not how Social Psychology (whether in the United States or in Europe) looks either at Stereotypes or their role in both cognitive and social life of individuals. If this is your critique of \u0026lsquo;indigenity\u0026rsquo;, I am afraid it will not wash. However, my argument is not with your notion of \u0026lsquo;stereotypes\u0026rsquo; but with your reasons for being too grateful to Wendy. Therefore, let me continue. Good for her that she \u0026ldquo;tries to avoid the options offered by reactions to colonialism.\u0026rdquo; But why should I be grateful to her for this? Has she chalked out a unique path which transcends these \u0026lsquo;alternatives\u0026rsquo; without transcending the genuine desires of the people, whose expressions these tendencies are? Does she do this or merely pontificate? It is easy for us all to look down upon these two tendencies, but it requires more than that to figure out the roots of the phenomena and offer an alternative to both. Do not forget, Patrick, that you are talking about the longings of a people, who have reacted this way to \u0026lsquo;colonialism\u0026rsquo;. I would be grateful to Wendy if she indeed shows where this deep longing comes from and how we could channelize these very powerful desires. She has not Patrick; and neither have you. In its absence, all I see is a sanctimonious attitude of someone who has no stake in a future that a people tries to carve out, but, instead, chooses merely to deride their attempts from the sideline. Do not expect me to be grateful for that.\nHer refusal to deny sexuality. Here, I must agree with you partially. But by only emphasizing this, she has contributed to towards building a perception that merely \u0026rsquo;eroticizes\u0026rsquo; a culture (this is too \u0026lsquo;polite\u0026rsquo; a way of saying it, but I will stick to it). Her views could be a corrective, I grant this in all good will, but it cannot become the leitmotif. Given her impact on Indology in the United Sates, she should have been more sensitive and realized that she would not simply be applying a corrective but that her \u0026lsquo;corrections\u0026rsquo; would end up as a \u0026lsquo;whole picture\u0026rsquo;. This reason alone is sufficient to reject your plea. (But with some reservations, as I have already noted.) 10 And thus we come to your last reason. Her students. You refer to one student; so does Rajiv Malhotra. He promises a sequel about her other students, whereas you do not mention more than one. How shall we look at this? That Paul Courtright wrote the book he did wrote because of Wendy or despite her? (I am simply assuming the truth of your assessment because I have not read that book.) I need more convincing arguments on this score.\nLet me summarize: I have found one reason (with some qualifications) for which I am grateful to Wendy and another reason (which is held in abeyance). Two reasons are as yet undecided. The other six are not good reasons for being grateful to Wendy Doniger.\nI do not care much for \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo;; but I do care, deeply and passionately, for the Indian traditions which include the \u0026lsquo;Indic traditions\u0026rsquo; as their subset. I care what you, Wendy, and the \u0026lsquo;British and American reader\u0026rsquo; think about my traditions. You too, I am led to believe, care what I care about.\nIt is in this spirit that I have heard you out. It is the same spirit that has pulled me away from my other duties and made me spend almost a day to compose this post. Such dialogues are necessary, perhaps today more than ever before. I have made my disagreements plain and provided you with reasons for my stance. I hope you will find it in you to respond in the same spirit.\nComments Dr. Edward Reilly — 2016-04-26 14:40:41\nMy academic reading has been in matters of Linguistics, Mythologies \u0026amp; Poetics, having stumbled across this affair \u0026amp; correspondence quite by accident. I found this article to be one of the more sensible that I\u0026rsquo;ve been reading. It seems that the argument arises from a question of whether Dr. Doniger was entitled to comment upon matters of Indian tradition, as an outsider, or worse still, representative of a foreign imperial power. Doniger is clearly heiress to Sir William Jones, Wolfgang von Goethe and all who hove followed in trying to understand a civilization from which their societies had been severed by the fall of Constantinople in the mid C15. Of course she has come to her studies through a path quite different to her predecessors, but by her own account, and the evidence of others, she knows the field of enquiry more than well enough. So, what may then be the cause of continued criticism? Tonality? Sympathy for the broad spectrum of humanity she has encountered in her travels \u0026amp; studies? Her feminism or even perceptions of residual Jewishness? Or, is the cause to be found in the ongoing struggle by contemporary Hindus to shake off the remnants of British colonial policies that had denigrated their native religion(s), Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism, even the Thomas Church, in all their complex varieties, in favour of Islam or their own cold-blooded version of Christianity? Perhaps the concept \u0026amp; practice of Hindutva, like Romuva in Lithuania, may need some further investigation \u0026amp; illustration by Mr. Balagangadhara for westerners, such as myself, to follow some of the arguments adduced. I found \u0026ldquo;The Hindus: An Alternative History\u0026rdquo; interesting, but also somewhat irritating, as I had wanted a more systematic, lingusitically rich approach: but that\u0026rsquo;s my preference, and it\u0026rsquo;s not cause enough to have the writer burnt at the stake.\n","tags":["Michael Witzel","Wendy Doniger","Patrick Hogan"],"title":"On Patrick Hogan’s 'Why Hindus should be grateful to Wendy Doniger'—S.N.Balagangadhara","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/on-patrick-hogans-why-hindus-should-be-grateful-to-wendy-doniger-s-n-balagangadhara/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","Christianity","knowledge"],"content":"The first striking thing is their presumption of knowledge at several levels. Yet, they display abysmal ignorance.\n(a) Christianity has not just had a two thousand years\u0026rsquo; history. It has also had two thousand years of doctrinal development. In the latter, every notion that has been employed here has been continuously discussed, refined, contested and so on. Their meanings, as they apply to Christianity\u0026rsquo;s self-description, has seeped into and determined what they mean in the English language. Not only words like \u0026lsquo;Christ\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;Church\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;Worship\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;idol\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;God\u0026rsquo; \u0026lsquo;revelation\u0026rsquo; and so on but also issues like \u0026lsquo;Who is a Christian\u0026rsquo;? (Quid sit Christianum esse?) The discussions hardly exhibit any knowledge of either the richness or complexity of these matters; yet, they express the firm conviction that what is there to be known is also known. In matters of knowledge, this combination is deadly.\n(b) For more than two hundred years, domains such as the history of sciences, philosophy of sciences have been conducting debates into the nature of scientific knowledge. For all the role the findings from these domains play in the discussions, they might as well be non-existent. One seems to know what a \u0026lsquo;scientific theory\u0026rsquo; is, what \u0026lsquo;scientific laws\u0026rsquo; are, what an explanandum is and what its relation to explanans is. Here is an illustration: it is nonsense to speak of Christianity\u0026rsquo;s intolerance without implying the intolerance of Christians. And it is said that such a claim should \u0026ldquo;provid(e) predictability about Christians.\u0026rdquo; Does it mean that the claim about the tolerance of Christianity should provide predictability not only about all those who called themselves as Christians in the past, all those who call themselves Christians in the present, but also all those who might call themselves as Christians in the future? Can any claim ever do this? How might any claim be capable of doing that? So one of the tests of the theory\u0026rsquo;s validity may be to work backwards from specimens of Christian individuals we find in daily life and ask ourselves if we find them \u0026ldquo;recognizably Christian\u0026rdquo; and also \u0026ldquo;tolerant.\u0026rdquo; Quite apart from the fact that no claim is ever be tested this way, how does this fare as an answer to the demand about predictability? What could one say about either the past or the future Christians by taking \u0026ldquo;specimens of Christian individuals we find in daily life\u0026rdquo;? And how on earth to answer the question, without a theory about Christianity, whether they are recognizably Christian?\nCan any claim (on its own) ever predict anything? What is \u0026lsquo;predictability\u0026rsquo;? What relation, if any, is there between this notion and that of explanation? Of course, if there were an understanding of these issues, they would not have been brought forward as objections or criticisms. Yet, the presumption of knowledge makes one \u0026ldquo;…rush in where angels fear to tread\u0026rdquo;.\n(c) It is this deadly combination that makes one (i) set up straw men by the dozens and (ii) knock them down. How can there be no revelation in India, when we speak of \u0026lsquo;Sruti\u0026rsquo;? asks one. \u0026ldquo;So any side-stepping about not wanting to discuss individuals except as \u0026ldquo;instances\u0026rdquo; of the Church they belong to is taking cover from controversy\u0026rdquo;, says the other. One knows what \u0026lsquo;revelation\u0026rsquo; is; the other suggests \u0026ldquo;there is no science without human disposition\u0026rdquo;. Balu says that Hinduism and Buddhism are not religions since they do not have one sacred text, revealation (sic), creed, central ecclesiastical organization etc., says one. Yet the same Balu, hardly a few posts earlier, had said this: In fact, in my book, I show that beliefs, holy books, a founder or even God are not even necessary for religion (severally or in conjunction). These are empirical constraints imposed on religion by the kind of beings we are. Of course, one hypothesis is that Balu is inconsistent; the other hypothesis is that one does not understand what one reads.

Now no one can forbid me from saying this and calling myself a Christian. Question: what should a theory about Christianity do? Show how anyone who decides to call himself a \u0026lsquo;Christian\u0026rsquo; is, in fact, also a Christian? In that case, all such a \u0026rsquo;theory\u0026rsquo; can do is say something like the following: anyone who calls himself some name (\u0026lsquo;Christian\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;Democrat\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;Marxist\u0026rsquo;, etc) is also whatever he calls himself. Such an attitude simply ends up making any knowledge of society and human beings impossible.\nThe second possibility is to \u0026rsquo;norm\u0026rsquo; the discussion. Someone, anyone, is a Christian if and only if he has the following properties: X, Y, Z. Such a discussion has been conducted during the two millennia that Christianity has been in existence by the different Christian sects. Each has called itself the \u0026rsquo;true\u0026rsquo; Christianity and stipulated conditions for being a \u0026ldquo;true Christian\u0026rdquo;. This discussion is an internal problem within Christianity and their answers do not interest me, except in one particular way.\nWhat I need to understand is why each sect within Christianity (from the Catholics through the Orthodox to the Protestants) finds it an important problem. That is to say, as a scientist, these facts constitute the problem-situation that I need to understand, assuming I want to produce knowledge about the phenomenon that Christianity is.\nEven here, we know that Christianity is simultaneously several things: it is a movement of people, it is a landlord and share holder, it is a marketing bureau and a political force\u0026hellip; and it is also what it is to its believers, namely, the revelation of the Biblical God in Jesus of Nazareth. I am primarily interested in understanding Christianity in its last aspect, namely, as a specific religion. I do not want to claim that their beliefs are either illusions or are true: my primary facts are their self-descriptions, which not only change from one sect to another but also over time.\nConsequently, I set up a hypothesis about what religion is and how Christianity is also a religion. I locate its dynamics of expansion in what is called the Christological dilemma. Using this hypothesis, I explain certain other features that are empirically observable in history.\nIf one has to criticize me, one has to follow the rules of the scientific game: come up with an alternative hypothesis that not only explains everything I explain, but also more. In all honesty, I have not yet come across such a hypothesis. But I do fervently hope that I will come across such an explanation in the future.\n","tags":[],"title":"How to produce knowledge about “Who is a Christian”—S.N.Balagangadhara","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/how-to-produce-knowledge-about-who-is-a-christian-s-n-balagangadhara/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","criticism"],"content":"Criticism: You are spreading hate by citing Deschner\u0026rsquo;s work–Kriminalgeschichte des Christentumsand ANY idiot knows even the title is stupid.\nI have not cited a single atrocity that Christianity has committed in order to incite hate towards Christianity.

This dilemma is discussed by theologians, themselves Christians, in the field of Christology. And even here, I localise in it the dynamics of Christianity. The intolerance of Christianity, I say very explicitly, is its property by virtue of being a religion. That is to say, according to my research, all religions are intolerant. You might want to disagree with it; you are welcome to put your arguments across that refute the result of my research. But how does this constitute spreading hate?

How is it a weakness? How is it not a strength?\nIn both the theory of rights and in discussions about liberty (or freedom), the following two ways of conceptualizing the issues have been present. One could see rights as an \u0026ldquo;ability or power or capacity\u0026rdquo; to do something (this is called \u0026ldquo;active rights\u0026rdquo;) or as a \u0026ldquo;duty someone else has towards the rights subject\u0026rdquo; (called the \u0026ldquo;passive rights\u0026rdquo;). Equally, liberty has been conceptualized \u0026lsquo;positively\u0026rsquo; (as one\u0026rsquo;s capacity) or \u0026rsquo;negatively\u0026rsquo; (what the other should not do to you). Any good introduction to the theory of rights or theory of liberty will provide you with the details you require as well as the limitations of these two conceptualizations.\nNo matter which of the formulations one prefers on philosophical grounds, the debates about \u0026ldquo;conversion\u0026rdquo; in India have been framed in these terms. The defense of a secular state that India is (or ought to be) is conducted in these terms as well. The opponents in this debate, funnily enough, accept the terms of the debate, but come up with arguments why banning \u0026ldquo;conversion\u0026rdquo; into Christianity and Islam is justified or justifiable today. These arguments might be pragmatic in nature, or base itself on one or another notion of \u0026ldquo;liberty\u0026rdquo; that the western political philosophy has developed or might appeal to the so-called paradox of freedom (\u0026lsquo;ought one be tolerant of the intolerant?\u0026rsquo;), and so on.\nThe clash between the secularists and the anti-secularists in general (or the Hindutva people in particular) exhibits itself in an ambiguous way. On the one hand, there is the issue of \u0026ldquo;conversion\u0026rdquo; into Christianity and Islam. Here, the question can be formulated in general terms as: what is the attitude of the Indian traditions towards the phenomenon itself? On the other hand, there is the issue about the terms of the debate: Is the western notion of a secular state the best, the most rational or even the most universal one? The discussions continuously switch from one issue to the other; from expressing the feeling (for it is present in these debates as no more than a feeling) that the western notion of secularism is not adequate to the Indian culture to conducting the debate in terms of the western political philosophy in order to express that feeling. The ambiguity lies in trying to express one problem in terms posed by another, which forbids such an expression.\nWhat Jakob and I did is to show that there are two different issues involved here: Is the secular state (founded on Law) a \u0026ldquo;neutral one?\u0026rdquo; How did the Indian traditions grapple with the issue conversion?\nThe first question is important in order to show that the secular stance that requires \u0026ldquo;freedom to convert\u0026rdquo; is anything but neutral in any sense of the notion of liberty or freedom. By the same token, the anti-secularist demand to forbid conversion through legislation accepts the very framework it wants to reject.\nThe second question is important because it allows us to provide an answer that is in sync with the nature of the Indian traditions. Not only that. We intend to show that this solution is more efficient, rational, and defensible than any other solution. The talk of resuscitating the vibrancy of the Indian traditions belongs here.\nNow, I can give a brief answer to your questions. If we accept the cry to ban the attempts at conversion, we will be accepting one or another variant of the western politico-philosophical thinking. In and of itself, there is nothing wrong with it, except that this thinking merely secularizes Christian theology. I do not see it as an expression of the strength of the Indian traditions to kneel down before the Cross and confess that we are all worshippers of the Devil. Whoever else might want to do it, I will not. I do think that our traditions have within themselves the strength and depth to allow us to think about cultures and societies in ways hardly dreamt of today. It is also an indication of the lack of strength. In fact, we confess that without some or another variant of western thinking in political philosophy, we cannot solve the problem of conversion. If such is the case, wherein lies the strength of the Indian traditions before they encountered the western culture?\n","tags":[],"title":"Legislations against proselytization: a weakness of Indian culture –S.N.

What exactly does this thought say? Begin with \u0026lsquo;historical context\u0026rsquo;. Either every situation that an individual human being finds himself is a \u0026lsquo;historical context\u0026rsquo; (because human beings are always \u0026lsquo;in a context\u0026rsquo; and these contexts always occur \u0026lsquo;in history\u0026rsquo;) or there is a difference between \u0026rsquo; a context\u0026rsquo; and a \u0026lsquo;historical context\u0026rsquo;. She cannot possibly make the latter of the two claims because if the meaning of \u0026lsquo;secularism\u0026rsquo; changes only in \u0026lsquo;historical contexts\u0026rsquo; but not in \u0026lsquo;other kinds of contexts\u0026rsquo;, it follows that \u0026lsquo;secularism\u0026rsquo; has a stable meaning in other contexts than \u0026lsquo;historical contexts\u0026rsquo;, which she would want to deny. So, for the sake of consistency, we have to assume that \u0026lsquo;context\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;historical context\u0026rsquo; are synonyms. Then, the thought is that meaning varies according to contexts. Consider the word \u0026lsquo;ice-cream\u0026rsquo;: the only way I can imagine that the meaning of this word varies according to individual contexts is the following: to one, it means a \u0026rsquo;life saver\u0026rsquo;; to the other \u0026lsquo;fattening\u0026rsquo; and to the third \u0026lsquo;sweet\u0026rsquo; and so on. (In fact, to one and the same individual \u0026lsquo;ice cream\u0026rsquo; could \u0026ldquo;mean different things\u0026rdquo; at different points in time: what ice-cream meant when one was 3 years need indeed not be the same as what it means when one is 50 and suffers from Diabetes and obesity.) So far so good. But the problem is this: these different meanings of \u0026lsquo;ice-cream\u0026rsquo; presuppose that we are talking about the same thing. Only under this condition can we say that \u0026lsquo;ice-cream\u0026rsquo; means different things to different people (or to the same person at different times). To talk about the same thing, ice-cream, we need a reference for that word and, in many cases (like secularism and communalism, for example) it is a \u0026rsquo;linguistic description\u0026rsquo; of that word (a \u0026lsquo;definition\u0026rsquo;, or its \u0026lsquo;meaning\u0026rsquo;) that provides us with reference. (In the case of ice-cream, one might use gestures to point out an ice-cream; you cannot do that for \u0026lsquo;secularism\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;communalism\u0026rsquo;.) In other words, the ONLY possible way for secularism to have multiple meanings in multiple historical contexts is by having a meaning that is INDEPENDENT of contexts. (Or having a meaning that is common across all POSSIBLE contexts.) In other words, when Neera or Shabnum or anyone else makes the claim that meanings do not transcend contexts either (a) they are making the trivial point that every word uttered by any human being always takes place in a context (which no one had ever denied) or (b) by saying that meaning is totally context bound they are contradicting themselves. Of course, to notice that one is inconsistent, one needs to think according to the rules of grammar and rules of logic.\nOn the one hand, she says that \u0026lsquo;meanings\u0026rsquo; are particular to their historical contexts and, yet, denies it at the same time: she finds that \u0026lsquo;infusing the category with new meaning is inadequate\u0026rsquo;. Now, if the meaning of secularism is particular to a context, it follows that \u0026rsquo;new meanings\u0026rsquo; (as compared to the old \u0026lsquo;meanings\u0026rsquo;: how, I wonder, does she \u0026lsquo;compare\u0026rsquo; the meanings or even how she can discover that some meaning is \u0026rsquo;new\u0026rsquo; and some other is \u0026lsquo;old\u0026rsquo;?) are infused in \u0026rsquo;new historical contexts\u0026rsquo;. If historical contexts are those that provide meanings, how, then, can she say, that a \u0026rsquo;new meaning\u0026rsquo; that a \u0026rsquo;new historical context\u0026rsquo; provides is \u0026ldquo;inadequate\u0026rdquo;? (How will she judge the adequacy or the inadequacy of meaning of secularism, if its meaning is particular to a historical context?) She must have a trans-historical context to say that some meaning of \u0026lsquo;secularism\u0026rsquo; is inadequate.\nAnd then, her argument is that the \u0026lsquo;premise\u0026rsquo; that meanings are independent of particular historical contexts is false. Let us assume that she is right. But what follows from noticing the falsity of a premise in a chain of argument? It merely tells us that, purely on logical grounds, the conclusion cannot be true. But, could the conclusion be true in any other way than be logically true? Of course, it can: it could be true purely as a contingent matter, i.e., it could be factually true (for example, \u0026lsquo;New York is a city in the US\u0026rsquo;) without being logically true (there is no logical mistake if the city had a different name or would get a new name). In other words, even if Shabnum were right, there is not much she can say about the truth of the factual claims made about secularism and communalism in India.\nThe problem with Shabnum Tejani s and Neera Chandhokes of this world boils down to this: they talk but do not think.\n","tags":[],"title":"Meanings and Historical Context: the arguments from Indian scholars –S.N.Balagangadhara","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/meanings-and-historical-context-the-arguments-from-indian-scholars-s-n-balagangadhara/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","criticism"],"content":"Let me just focus on one important and one not-so-important claim from Will Sweetman\u0026rsquo;s article \u0026ldquo;Hinduism\u0026rdquo; and the history of \u0026ldquo;religion\u0026rdquo;: Protestant presuppositions in the critique of the concept of Hinduism. He suggests that I argue the following.\nFirst premise: Christianity is prototypically what religion is.\nSecond premise: Hinduism does not share all (or perhaps any) of the relevant properties of Christianity.\nConclusion: Hinduism is not a religion.\nThe problem, here, turns around the notion of \u0026lsquo;prototypicality\u0026rsquo;. I explain at length (a) the source of the word; and (b) its meaning. For the role these clarifications play in Sweetman\u0026rsquo;s analysis, I might as well not have written those passages.\n\u0026lsquo;Prototypical\u0026rsquo; talks about our language-use. What it says is this. We use the word \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo; in English to minimally refer to Christianity. This use does not tell us what the word \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo; means; does not tell us that Christianity is a religion. In the book, I suggest that Christianity might not even be a religion and that our language-use might be totally wrong in this case. (For instance, we used to refer to whales as \u0026lsquo;Fishes\u0026rsquo;. We now know they are mammals.) But we can only make such a claim after we have a theory of religion. This is the meaning of the word \u0026lsquo;prototypical\u0026rsquo;. We need to rewrite the first premise so that this point becomes clear.\nFirst premise: In English, the word \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo; refers minimally to Christianity.\nSecond premise: Hinduism does not share all (or perhaps any) of the relevant properties of Christianity.\nConclusion: ??????\nWe cannot conclude what Sweetman makes me conclude. We cannot even conclude that the word \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo; does not refer to Hinduism (unless we add an additional premise: the word \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo; refers to Christianity by virtue of the properties of Christianity).\nThe problem is clear. Sweetman assumes that \u0026lsquo;prototypicality\u0026rsquo; is the same as (or something like) \u0026lsquo;central\u0026rsquo; or \u0026rsquo;essential\u0026rsquo; properties of an object. Better put. He probably thinks that a prototypical \u0026rsquo;example\u0026rsquo; is the best example of an object. However, the technical meaning of the word is not that. It is about what, in language-use, is understood as a best instance of a word. As I explain in the book, this notion is used for most natural-language categories and for sets for which the criteria of set-membership are vague. \u0026lsquo;Face\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;bucket\u0026rsquo; (to keep to the book) are examples of such natural language categories. \u0026lsquo;:)\u0026rsquo; is a face; so is a visual smiley. A photograph of a smiling person is \u0026lsquo;prototypical\u0026rsquo; when compared to either of the two. This has to do with graded membership of the set \u0026lsquo;face\u0026rsquo;, and where it is not possible to come up with an all-or-none criteria. (For instance, \u0026lsquo;:)\u0026rsquo; is not a face straight away to someone who either does not know computer conventions or to whom the trick of seeing a face in that set of symbols is not yet explained.)\nIn other words, Sweetman\u0026rsquo;s representation of my \u0026lsquo;argument\u0026rsquo; is flawed. I do not say this. This is the important point. Now to the not-so-important point. He says the following: \u0026ldquo;Balagangadhara himself acknowledges that \u0026ldquo;there is a quasi-universal consensus that the \u0026lsquo;Western\u0026rsquo; concept of religion is inadequate\u0026rdquo; (Balagangadhara 1994: 313) but he fails to see that this in itself is not a reason for thinking that Hinduism is not a religion but, rather, a reason to work out a better concept of religion.\u0026rdquo;\nI discuss exactly this (and show its triviality) when I discuss Staal. Which intellectual does not want to work out a \u0026ldquo;better concept\u0026rdquo;? What does this mean, in any case? That we should come up with a concept that also makes Hinduism into a religion? He calls my hypothesis a \u0026rsquo;tendentious\u0026rsquo; concept and makes it sound as though I am doing something wrong. Encarta, for instance, defines the word this way: \u0026ldquo;written or spoken by somebody who obviously wants to promote a particular cause or who supports a particular viewpoint\u0026rdquo;. I want to promote a scientific viewpoint. Quite obviously, this is not what Sweetman probably has in mind because he does not consider his argument \u0026rsquo;tendentious\u0026rsquo;.\n","tags":["Will Sweetman"],"title":"On Will Sweetman’s Criticism—S.N.Balagangadhara","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/on-will-sweetmans-criticism-s-n-balagangadhara/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","Christianity"],"content":"You say: Thus when one says that many Indian Christians are pluralistic \u0026hellip; it cannot be refuted simply by saying, well Christian doctrine fundamentally cannot be pluralistic \u0026ndash; because all doctrine ultimately always gets interpreted at the level of the individual.\nWhile it is indeed true that, in the last analysis, everything happens at the level of the individual, it is wrong to say that, therefore, claims about the Indian Christians cannot be refuted by referring to Christian theology.\nThe reason is not far to seek: Christian theology sets limits to the interpretations proposed by the individual believer. One cannot be a Christian \u0026ndash; of any denomination \u0026ndash; and say, for example, that Jesus is the incarnation of the Devil, or that any arbitrary dog is Christ, or that the Messiah has not come, or that God is a figment of the Human mind, or that Mohammed is the last prophet of God, and so on and so forth. Consequently, while latitude can and should be given to the \u0026lsquo;interpretations\u0026rsquo; of received theological doctrines that a believer provides, it is false to claim that the individual, all on one\u0026rsquo;s own, decides about doctrinal interpretations.\nConsequently, one can propose what a Christian can and cannot believe in and still remain a Christian. Deciding whether some or another Indian is a Christian is not an issue of undertaking a Gallup Poll, but one of taking recourse to Christian theology.\nHere is where the Indian traditions differ fundamentally from the Semitic religions. In these cases, appeal to an individual\u0026rsquo;s interpretation does not settle the issue one way or another, whereas an appeal to theology does.\nThere is no way that one can take up the question, Who is a Christian? and answer it here. I have discussed this issue through many chapters in my book and I have no hope of being able to summarize it here. One of the reasons for it is that this question does not have one interpretation and one answer: it depends on who is asking the question to whom and for what purpose.\nHowever, let me just say that you are not raising the issue of who a Christian is, but whether Christianity in India is different in some significant aspects because it has come into and grown in the Indian culture. In so far as you talk about the hypothetical Indian on a park bench, you are asking what the process of conversion entails. \u0026ldquo;Exclusivity\u0026rdquo; is not the fine print, but that you say it is shows the extent to which you (as an Indian, Hindu, and the heathen) have difficulty in understanding what religion is. That is what the title of my book says: as heathens, we are blind to the existence of religion, we do not see it.

This figure is \u0026ldquo;the promised one\u0026rdquo;, the \u0026ldquo;messiah\u0026rdquo;, the \u0026ldquo;anointed one\u0026rdquo;, and so on. Kindly note that there is a difference between the Christ as a figure and Jesus of Nazareth. The Jews also believe in the Christ figure, but they figure that he has not yet come, and they are awaiting his arrival. The Christians reckon that the Christ has come and that Jesus of Nazareth was the \u0026ldquo;prophesied one\u0026rdquo;.\nJesus of Nazareth, according to Christianity, is also the Christ, and without that being the case, there can be no Christianity. What exactly does the claim that Jesus is the Christ mean? There is a whole branch within Christian theology that deals with this question, and it is called Christology. It deals with many several themes, all focussed around the person and figure of Jesus Christ.\nIn my book, I speak at length about what I call the Christological dilemma. I cannot hope to summarize it here, but let me simply identify the issue. But before doing so, one needs to have some understanding of what it means to speak of a dilemma. It merely means the following: (a) a dilemma involves a choice; (b) the necessary elements of a choice present themselves as alternatives; (c) neither of the alternative is sufficient on its own; (d) one needs both the alternatives together, but one cannot have both. Such a situation presents the chooser with a dilemma.\nThe figure of Jesus Christ presents Christianity with such a dilemma. According to Christianity, in Jesus (a) God not only reveals Himself, but is also (b) His Unique Revelation. It is the combination of (a) and (b) that makes the son of a carpenter (Jesus of Nazareth) into the Christ. The very same combination presents Christianity with the Christological dilemma.\nChrist is the Unique revelation of God. That is, his is the only way to God. At the same time, it is also a revelation of God, as such, one of the multiple revelations of God, and thus one of the ways to God. Though following Christ is the only way to God, it is a way which is open to the whole of Humankind. Though open to the whole of humankind, the other ways that the humankind follows lead not to the Lord but to the Devil.\nIn other words, in the phrase \u0026ldquo;In Christ, God reveals Himself Uniquely\u0026rdquo; contains the dilemma. Either we emphasize the Unique character of God\u0026rsquo;s revelation in Christ: in that case, Christianity becomes, to use the phrase current on this board, exclusivist and intolerant. Or we emphasize the fact that God Reveals Himself in Jesus: in that case, we can also talk of other revelations of God as being at par. But by doing so, the figure of Christ disappears from the picture. Christianity might become inclusive and tolerant, but the price it pays is that it ceases being Christianity. In fact, in such a situation, I argue, one will even be unable to say whether it is God who reveals Himself or someone else.\nIn the course of the two thousand years that constitute the history of Christianity, indefinitely many solutions have been worked out to address the issue of the Christological dilemma. From the rabidly exclusivist positions that make Christianity into a sect at one end of the spectrum, to the extremely tolerant Philosophical Theisms at the other end. The first emphasizes the Unique way: thus it focuses on the person in whom God reveals Himself (an exclusive Christology that makes theo-logy irrelevant); the other, by contrast, emphasizes God who reveals Himself (an exclusive theology that makes Christology irrelevant). The point, however, is that one needs both in Christianity but one cannot have both.\nIn other words, it is not my theory of religion that imposes the choice of being either (a) intolerant and exclusive or (b) being tolerant but non-Christian. Rather, it is the very figure at the heart of Christianity, namely Jesus as Christ, who gives birth to this dilemma.\nOn the basis of just this dilemma alone, one could not only predict that there are bound to be variations within Christianity but also, more importantly, predict the limits of such a variation. Of course, there are all kinds of other factors involved too, and they too add to the predictability.\nNow, one can make better sense (I hope) of my disinterest in saying whether Alex Alexander, Chacko and Abraham Verghese are Christians or not. It must also be clear why and in what sense the question \u0026ldquo;who is a Christian?\u0026rdquo; is an internal problem within Christianity.\n","tags":[],"title":"Christological dilemma and “who is a Christian”","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/christological-dilemma-and-who-is-a-christian/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","secularization","interests"],"content":"About the state, state action and the issue of public interest. There are multiple problems here, which I am only slowly beginning to recognize. I will share two such problems with you without, however, being able to concretely spell out the alternatives. (a) Consider the belief that the state \u0026lsquo;ought\u0026rsquo; to act in the public interest. This belief makes sense if we assume that it is possible to speak in terms of \u0026lsquo;public interest\u0026rsquo; in some non-trivial fashion. Both Kenneth Arrow and Amrtya Sen have proved theorems that show that any such use incoherent: Arrow argued that we cannot speak of \u0026lsquo;public will\u0026rsquo; in any coherent way; Sen argued that we cannot aggregateprivate preferences into a consistent and coherent set of \u0026lsquo;public preferences\u0026rsquo;. Our notion of \u0026lsquo;public interest\u0026rsquo; includes these two notions and, as a consequence, does not allow of a coherent conceptualization. Even banning smoking in public places (whatever the notion of a \u0026lsquo;public space\u0026rsquo; be) is not very coherent, if argued in terms of \u0026lsquo;public interest\u0026rsquo;. In this sense, justifying complex actions, which carry unintended consequences, in the name of public interest is not an interesting exercise. (b) Despite this, the idea of the state and its relation to public interest preoccupies people because of something else: that is the belief that every institution in society has an \u0026lsquo;interest\u0026rsquo; and the state has a \u0026lsquo;public interest\u0026rsquo;. That is, there is an underlying assumption of \u0026lsquo;intelligibility\u0026rsquo; to claims about \u0026ldquo;institutional interests\u0026rsquo;: each institution has an interest the way each individual has either a \u0026lsquo;desire\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;interest\u0026rsquo;. The more I read history, the less intelligible it has become to me. I believe that this claim is a \u0026lsquo;secular translation\u0026rsquo; of the idea that the Christian Church has some set of interests and political thinking, since the Middle Ages in Europe, has so constantly hammered on this theme that it has become a trivial fact that we take for granted. It is totally unclear to me how we identify the \u0026lsquo;interests\u0026rsquo; of a social institution, the State included, and how we find out whether we are wrong or right in attributing such an \u0026lsquo;interest\u0026rsquo; to a social institution. In other words, we have no clue how we solve our disagreement in this area of legal and political philosophy: the more radical the disagreement, the less clear how we should solve the issue: suppose I deny that the State has any set of interests that it can call its own, how do we solve this disagreement?

Laudan\u0026rsquo;s argument is convincing. The problem is it makes all these judges and lawyers look like fools. Balu was not satisfied by Laudan\u0026rsquo;s pragmatic justification of proof beyond a reasonable doubt (of 10 accused, the principle will lead to 9 being legitimately convicted and 1 innocent fellow going to the gallows). Interestingly, the advocacy of this legal principle often invokes a notion of \u0026lsquo;moral certainty\u0026rsquo;. It is as though when a group of 12 (?) jury members and a judge unanimously come to the decision that there is proof beyond a reasonable doubt, then the individual at the other end must be guilty of whatever he or she is accused of. Now, this attitude, Balu suggests, reflects the notion of conscience in the Christian religion. According to the theology of conscience, God has inscribed His Law for humanity in all human creatures. A few definitions can show what conscience means to Christians: \u0026ldquo;The conscience of man…Is a man\u0026rsquo;s judgement of himselfe, according to the judgement of God of him.\u0026rdquo; Or: \u0026ldquo;Conscience is that Power, or Faculty of the Mind, which judges of our Actions according to a right Rule, whether they be agreeable to it or not.\u0026rdquo; This rule is God\u0026rsquo;s Will. Conscience is called \u0026ldquo;that universal Monarch, whose Ubiquitary Throne is establish\u0026rsquo;d in every mortal Breast.\u0026rdquo; A Quaker writes that conscience is \u0026ldquo;an Ability in the Understanding of man, by a reflective act to judge of himself in all he does, as to his acceptance or rejection with God\u0026rdquo; and he adds that \u0026ldquo;this is the inward Rule he hath to walk by.\u0026rdquo; Before the fall, Adam had been perfectly good and even after the fall, humankind retained the knowledge of the perfectly good in contrast with evil. This perfect knowledge allowed man to distinguish \u0026ldquo;between Good and Evil,\u0026rdquo; and worked as \u0026ldquo;a constant witness to God in his soul, and by secret reference to what he was at firrst, tells him what he still ought to be.\u0026rdquo; The left-over of God\u0026rsquo;s Will in us after the Fall is what we still call conscience. In other words, conscience tells us how we ought to act according to God\u0026rsquo;s Will and judges every act of ours in relation to this norm. Given the belief that each individual conscience still reflects the Will of God to some extent (unless it is completely corrupted, but this the selection of jury members is supposed to prevent), the origin of the notions of moral certainty and proof beyond a reasonable doubt becomes clear. When so many good Christians agree on the guilt of the accused, it must be God\u0026rsquo;s Will speaking through their consciences. It is sickening to see how law\u0026rsquo;s reproduction of secularized Christian attitudes towards morality leads to the upholding of a silly principle in the American courts (and to the conviction of innocents).\n","tags":[],"title":"Secularized Christian Theme: Moral Certainty and Proof Beyond a Reasonable Doubt","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/secularized-christian-theme-moral-certainty-and-proof-beyond-a-reasonable-doubt/"},{"categories":["Jakob","secularization"],"content":"One of these so-called secular accounts that are in fact Christian is the belief that all cultures have a religion. It is simply a secularization of the Christian belief that the biblical God gave religion to humankind, which was transformed into the assumption that religion is a cultural universal during the Enlightenment. This pre-theoretical assumption precedes all empirical research and theory-formation on religion and culture. From the early missionaries to the contemporary anthropologists, no one has ever even doubted that the phenomenon of religion is universal to all cultures. All psychological and sociological and even biological and neurological explanations of religion take this pre-theoretical Christian theological assumption as a starting point. Now, this is hardly scientific, isn\u0026rsquo;t it? In his book \u0026lsquo;The Heathen in His Blindness: Asia, the West and the dynamic of religion\u0026rsquo;, Balagangadhara shows that the belief that all cultures have religion has more to do with the structure of the Christian religion than with the nature of human cultures. Furthermore, he develops a theory of religion which reveals that Christianity, Islam, and Judaism are at present the only instances of the phenomenon of religion. On top of that, he shows why those belonging to these religions and to the cultures they have created, are deeply inclined to believe that all human cultures must have a religion or at least a world view. The latter belief in the universality of religion is not a scientific hypothesis at all, but a religious doctrine. He also shows that the pagan traditions have a structure that is completely different from that of these three religions. In other words, the semitic religions and the pagan traditions are not variants of the same supposedly universal phenomenon of religion, rather they are different phenomena .\n","tags":[],"title":"Secularized Christian Belief: Religion is a cultural/human universal","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/secularized-christian-belief-religion-is-a-culturalhuman-universal/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","secularization","tolerance"],"content":"Assuming that the distinction I proposed between civic tolerance and religious tolerance is acceptable, let us proceed further to analyze the notion of civic tolerance more closely. (I am simply assuming that it is desirable and that, from now on, we are talking about religious matters.)\nIt is (logically) possible that there could be religious intolerance and yet the believers in such religions could have the virtue of civic tolerance. That is to say, even (a) if there is religious intolerance, believers in some religion or another could have a society where there is civic tolerance. As suggested earlier, (b) religious tolerance implies the presence of civic tolerance.\nWhat do the above two statements suggest? That there could be a possible world (or a possible society) where both are true as a matter of empirical fact. Let us further assume that western democracies are examples of such a society.\nWe can now rewrite this as follows. Under certain circumstances, the existence of civic tolerance is indifferent to whether there is religious tolerance or religious intolerance. What are these circumstances?\nLet us accept the story about Europe at face value. There is a neutral umpire with respect to religious maters (namely the state) that enforces civic tolerance. When does such a state come into being? Here, the stories about the western culture are of no use. Why? These stories tell us that (a) generations of religious strife results in the creations of such a state (because people get tired of religious strife) and/or (b) European psychology became \u0026rsquo;enlightened\u0026rsquo;. (a) is empirically false: Lebanon, Palestine, Ireland, etc. are examples that show us that generations of religious strife drives violence deeper into the body of society instead of generating some kind of \u0026rsquo;tiredness\u0026rsquo;. (b) is also false: Ireland tells us that much.\nConsequently, a neutral state might be a necessary condition but it is not sufficient. What more is required? It appears that this umpire must be seen to be neutral by the participants. If it is not seen as neutral, then this state cannot enforce civic tolerance. In the case of Ireland and Lebanon, believers do not see the state as a neutral entity (with respect to religious matters) and, consequently, there is continuous religious strife. (To put it in the language familiar to us, a secular state cannot enforce civic tolerance in a society if the participants do not perceive the state as a neutral entity with respect to religious matters.)\nWhat is required for the state to be seen as a neutral entity with respect to religious matters? Let us look again at the western history. (i) The state must not take any position regarding the truth or falsity of the religions. That is to say, the state does not say (a) religion is the revelation of God; (b) religion is not the revelation of God. (It does the same with respect to different denominations.) That is to say, the state must remain agnostic with respect to God and His revelation. (ii) It is not enough that state is agnostic but it must be seen to be agnostic as well. What does that mean? The participants must recognize agnosticism as a possibility they can countenance in their strife. That means, for both believers and atheists, agnosticism must appear as a reasonable option within their discourse. That is, in more general terms, agnosticism is a choice both within a theistic discourse and an atheistic discourse and, as such, is a part of such discourses. And, as such, is not an independent third choice that is above and beyond theism and atheism.\nLet me introduce my research at this stage. I claim that atheism is secularized theism. If that is the case, agnosticism is a part of both theism and its secularized version (namely, atheism). Better put: agnosticism is one of the mechanisms in secularizing theism itself. And, in so far as the state is an agnostic entity, it suggests that the \u0026rsquo;neutral\u0026rsquo; state that the western democracies speak of is one of the mechanisms in the secularization of Christianity itself. That is, it spreads dechristianized Christianity. Hence, it is acceptable both to the Christians and to the disguised Christians.\nChristianity, as we know empirically, comes in different brands. Consequently, the \u0026rsquo;neutral\u0026rsquo; state in western democracies not only spreads a dechristianized Christianity but also a particular brand of dechristianized Christianity. And this brand must be acceptable to all the citizens in that society.\nThis hypothesis, I think, is also sufficient to account for the failure for \u0026ldquo;western secularism\u0026rdquo; to take hold (a) in the Middle East, (b) in India, (c) in Ireland. This has nothing to do with the psychology of peoples in these cultures or the \u0026lsquo;genius\u0026rsquo; of the Western people but do with what the so-called \u0026rsquo;neutral\u0026rsquo; state is all about. The state cannot spread any brand of dechristianized Christianity in cultures that are not Christian; in Ireland, the strife is precisely about which brand of dechristainized Christianity the state ought to spread.\nThis is not the only reason why this hypothesis is worthy of further investigation. It also explains the perceptions of (some) people as well. In India, the \u0026ldquo;secular state\u0026rdquo; that Nehru dreamt of is not only seen not being neutral but also as something \u0026lsquo;alien\u0026rsquo; to the Indian traditions. If the \u0026lsquo;secular\u0026rsquo; state spreads some brand of dechristianized Christianity, then it is obvious that it will be seen as something \u0026lsquo;alien\u0026rsquo; to the Indian traditions. Further, where a majority of people are not Christians (but, say, Muslims or Jews) then, it is also obvious that they will be against any brand of dechristianized Christianity. This might tell us a bit more both about the state of Israel and the fact that Muslims seem to reject the necessity of a \u0026ldquo;secular state\u0026rdquo;.\nThere is also another intriguing issue that this hypothesis can shed some light on. Despite claiming to be a \u0026rsquo;neutral\u0026rsquo; state, the Indian state interferes in the Indian traditions. Of course, this is a British legacy. But is there also a logic to it? I do think so, and I think this hypothesis can also shed light on that issue. But that is for another post because this post has become very dense already.\nFor more, please check the article \u0026ldquo;The secular state and religious conflict: liberal neutrality and the Indian case of pluralism\u0026rdquo;\n","tags":[],"title":"The religion of secular state: deChristianized Christianity –S.N.Balagangadhara","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/the-religion-of-secular-state-dechristianized-christianity-s-n-balagangadhara/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","belief"],"content":"Can history-centrism cause some religion or the other to be belief-based?

I am not discussing (a): I do not know this unique individual, his history, his feelings and such like. Let us look at what discussing (b) entails.\nConsider the following two assertions he makes:\n(i) My Christianity does allow me to accept the rights of others to seek God in whatever manifestation they like.\n(ii) I value and cherish the teachings of Jesus as conveyed to me through my early religious influences in my childhood.\nOn the basis of these two statements alone and asking further clarifications and amplifications one can know more about the kind of Christianity Alex Alexander\u0026rsquo;s Church represents.\nRegarding (i), some of the questions are: (a) Does it imply that there are no obstacles to finding God in manifestations like Shiva, Vishnu, Saraswathi, Hanuman, and such like? That is, if one believes that these are manifestations of God, are they also the manifestations of God?\n(b) Could one earn salvation through personal efforts? That is, is salvation a reward for the efforts a human being puts in?\n(c) What should be saved and from what? Can an individual save himself? through his own, individual efforts?\n(d) Could a moral individual who denies God also attain salvation?\n(e) Is doing puja to the idol of Ganesha identical to the worship of God?\n(f) Supposing an individual explicitly denies that Jesus is the Saviour and follows Ramana Maharshi instead equally explicitly. Are there impediments to his salvation?\nThus one could go on. Answers to these questions will tell us whether the Church Alex Alexander belongs to is religiously tolerant or not.\nRegarding (ii), the following questions can be raised. (a) Is one who follows the ethical teachings of Jesus (e.g. love thy neighbour) is saved if he only followed these ethical teachings?\n(b) What, if any, is the difference between Jesus and Christ?\n(c) Is a figure like Buddha also the Christ figure? Are Shankara, Ramakrishna Paramahmsa, Ramana Maharshi the same as Jesus of Nazareth or the same as Jesus Christ or both or none?\n(d) I value the teachings of, say, Ramanujacharya, and Shishunala Sheriff (a Sufi Dasa). Does Alex Alexander value the teachings of Jesus the same way, i.e. because they provide insights into human beings? I can reject some aspects of their teachings, if they do not satisfy me. Does he have the same freedom to reject some aspects of the teaching of Jesus and still lay claim to salvation?\n(e) I cherish the teachings of Shankaracharya regarding some aspects and that of Ramana Maharshi about some other points. That is, I can say that, regarding some or another aspect, I dislike their teachings or that they are wrong or that I prefer someone else\u0026rsquo;s teachings. Does Alex Alexander cherish the teachings of Jesus in the same way?\nThus one could go on and on regarding these kinds of questions as well.\nSuch questions are legitimate because Alex Alexander\u0026rsquo;s Church will have explicit standpoints (or they are derivable as implications) on such and similar issues. These are not questions about whether Alex Alexander feels the same kind of reverence whether in a Church or a temple; they are about what religious tolerance means with respect to the Church he belongs.\nOne could easily be against conversion by Islam and some brands of Christianities in India. The rivalry between the Christian sects could easily explain (much more satisfactorily) why some Christian Churches in India are won for anti-conversion legislations. That, however, does not make all of them into tolerant Christians, does it? We need far more proof (which could easily be given by answering questions like the above) to be convinced that tolerant Christianity is not a contradiction in terms.\nIt is also advisable not to seek easy parallels between a Jesus-Bhakta and a Christian. Most of us heathens understand too little about the theory and practice of Christianity to do that.\n","tags":[],"title":"Is tolerant Christianity a contradiction in terms?","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/is-tolerant-christianity-a-contradiction-in-terms-s-n-balagangadhara/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","tolerance"],"content":" Today, in countries like England, Belgium, Germany, Italy and the United States, many religions (Judaism, Christianity, Islam) and many brands of some of these religions (Catholicism, Protestantism of various shades, Orthodox Churches, etc) coexist. In Belgium or Italy, for instance, the Catholic Christians do not impose their faiths on those who are not Catholics, i.e., they do not go around \u0026ldquo;proselytizing\u0026rdquo; the non-Catholics in their countries; in The Netherlands and Germany, for instance, the Catholics and the Protestants do not go around assaulting each other the way they did during the period of Reformation. Even the Jehovah\u0026rsquo;s Witnesses do not impose their faith, when they canvass the \u0026ldquo;Good Word\u0026rdquo; from door to door. The Muslims in Britain, for instance, do not go around converting all non-Muslims either. Questions: Does that mean that Catholic Christianity in Belgium and Italy (for instance) has become more tolerant than it was couple of centuries ago? Does it mean that Protestantism has become more tolerant than it was some three centuries or so ago? Does it mean that Islam in Britain (or in the United States) is more tolerant than Islam, say, in Africa? Or does it mean that these countries have become more tolerant of the existence of several religions and religious denominations in the interstices of their society than they were a few centuries ago?\nThat these questions can be raised intelligibly and that they can be answered through historical research show that the word \u0026rsquo;tolerance\u0026rsquo; might mean different things depending on the context in which it is raised. Tolerance of the existence of different religions within one society is a civic virtue that all citizens within that society accept. (This is the case with the Catholics in Belgium and Italy; Protestants in Holland and Germany; Muslims in the United States, etc.)\nDoes the foregoing indicate that Catholic Christianity (and its believers), Protestant Christianity (and its believers), Islam (and its believers) have become more tolerant of each other and of other religions? That is to say, does Islam, today, think that Christianity is as true as it itself is; does Catholic Christianity think that the Protestants\u0026rsquo; claims are as true as their own? Does Judaism believe that their belief that the Messiah had not come is as true as the claim that he has? And so on. Their respective beliefs were one of the reasons for the religious struggles of yesteryears. Consequently, if these religions have become more tolerant of each other, then it is because either (a) their beliefs have changed; or (b) the believers interpret these beliefs differently, or (c) both.\nFurther, if this situation has come about because of the civic virtue I spoke of earlier, then one could indeed claim that these religions have become more tolerant than they were before. Is this the situation?\nAgain, these questions can be raised intelligibly. One can also give different kinds of answers. Some of the answers in this context might even have to appeal to answers provided in 1. From all of these considerations, it follows that the notion of tolerance used here has a different extension than the notion of tolerance as a civic virtue. Let us call this \u0026ldquo;religious tolerance\u0026rdquo; to distinguish it from \u0026ldquo;civic tolerance\u0026rdquo;.\nTolerance as a civic virtue revolves around building a society free of religious strife. That is, it answers the question, \u0026lsquo;how can different religious communities coexist in one and the same society?\u0026rsquo; Religious tolerance, on the other hand, revolves around the question of truth. That is, it is an answer to the question, \u0026lsquo;which religion is true?\u0026rsquo;\nThis is an additional reason to distinguish between these two.\nNotice that one could cultivate the civic virtue of tolerance without, in the least, being required to be religiously tolerant as well. One cannot be religiously tolerant without, at the same time, having the civic virtue of tolerance as well. (This is a further indication that these notions have different extensions.) At first sight, then, it looks as though religious tolerance implies civic tolerance. However, that is not quite the case: one could be religiously tolerant, i.e., accept that all religions are either equally true (or equally false, as the case may be), and yet be intolerant, say, of fascists. This shows that the implication between religious and civic tolerance holds only in the context of discussion about religions.\nThis is a further indication that there is a substantive difference between civic tolerance and religious tolerance.\nEven though more nuances can be added and more reasons adduced to distinguish between civic and religious tolerance, I hope this is enough to provide a prima facie plausibility to my suggestion that, for the sake of clarity, we would do better to distinguish the two from each other.\nIn my book, I have been insisting that Christianity is an intolerant religion because it is a religion in the first place. In my book I have shown why this is the case. I have argued there that faith and intolerance are two faces of the same coin, i.e., one is intolerant precisely because one believes.\nTo put it in terms of the distinction I have introduced: Jews, Christians and Muslims (of today) might or might not have learnt the civic virtue of tolerance; but as Jews, Christians, and Muslims they are religiously intolerant. That is, they cannot accept that each of them is as true as the other.\nNot only that. While each of the above three religions (and their believers) think that the other is deficient in their worship of God, all of them believe that our traditions are false religions. The latter are that because they worship the false gods. In other words, there is a difference even with respect to their religious intolerance: regarding each other, the above three religions think that the other is deficient in worshipping God; regarding us, all three believe that we worship false gods.

If you look at the stakeholders, the European princes (with their sponsor-a-heretic-for-the-week) and the existing Papal power (which was the unifying force till then, with not so powerful string of monarchies). The reformation could be seen as the announcement of political independence from Rome, and allowing the monarchies to shake off the papal authority.\none is intolerant precisely because one believes.\nI haven\u0026rsquo;t read your book (first time here), but I will read it to see how you back this up. I don\u0026rsquo;t have particularly developed views on this, but what I feel is intolerance (persecution?) has a political aspect, in societies where the religion moved on, civic society filled its place. Islam is a late entrant in such spaces and it is not unexpected of them to not fit in, and that\u0026rsquo;s how they coexist peacefully.\n","tags":[],"title":"Religious intolerance vs. civic intolerance I","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/religious-intolerance-vs-civic-intolerance/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","basics","Christianity"],"content":" A Christian netizen says: here is within exclusive religions the claim that theirs is the only way to God (that claim can be true or false). There is in inclusive religions the claim that there are several ways to God and that it is quite possible that one of the exclusive ones (or many of them) are also ways to God. Both these statements cannot be true at the same time iff the logical law of excluding the middle holds. I don\u0026rsquo;t think that I have come across a way around this except through it \u0026ndash; i.e. one of the claims must be false or worst case both are false (there is no God or there is no path yet).\nLet me try to provide you with a species of reasoning, which assumes that the law of the excluded middle holds and yet is not inconsistent just because it affirms the truth of both statements.\nConsider a Christian affirming the following: \u0026ldquo;Only through Christ could a human being hope for salvation.\u0026rdquo; This is the exclusivist claim that proclaims the unique nature of God\u0026rsquo;s revelation in Christ, affirms further too that salvation is not something that a human being earns but one that depends on the Grace of God. (And any and all other things that a Christian needs to believe in, in order to be a Christian.) To the Christian, this is a claim about the world. That is, it is capable of being either true or false and, quite obviously, the Christian believes it to be true. (We will bracket aside the reasons why the Christian believes it to be true.) Because of the truth of this claim, the Christian believes further that the Indian heathen is headed for hell.\nThe Indian heathen believes in the truth of the following claim (let us say): \u0026ldquo;There are many paths to heaven.\u0026rdquo; He believes this to be a claim about the world as well. That is, it is capable of being either true or false and the Indian heathen believes it to be true. Because of the truth of this claim, the Indian heathen is willing to acknowledge that the Christian\u0026rsquo;s belief could be true as well. Question: Is the Indian heathen being inconsistent? Answer: no!\nHere is how the Indian Heathen reasons: (a) Because there are many paths to heaven, I believe that it is true to say that there are many paths to heaven. (b) The Christians claim that their path is also a path to heaven. (c) Therefore, the Christian path is also one path to heaven as well. (d) The Christian believes that his path to heaven is the only path to heaven. (e) I assent to the truth of (d). (f) However, because of the that clause, my assent to the truth about what the Christian believes in does not make the Christian belief true. (The that clause is not truth-functional. My admitting to the truth that Christians hold some beliefs to be true does not make these Christian beliefs true, of course.)\nIn other words, in the hands of the Indian heathen, the Christian object-level claims about the world get transformed into claims about the beliefs of the Christians. This transformation is entirely justified because each claim the Christian makes about the world is preceded with \u0026ldquo;I believe that\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;. So, what the Indian heathen does is prefix the claims of the Christians with the intentional operator (or the that clause).\nWhen this happens, the Indian heathen has two types of claims about the world: one about the different paths to heaven; the second about the belief-world of the Christians, which is also a claim about the world because it is about the fellow-human beings. The law of excluded middle is not abrogated; the Indian Heathen is consistent but he does not say that the Christian religion is false. The same avenue is not open to the Christian.\n","tags":[],"title":"Intentional operator and inconsistent reasoning","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/intentional-operator-and-inconsistent-reasoning/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","History","stories"],"content":" What is history? In the first place, it is the subject matter of historiography, which is what historians write. What does historiography talk about? The human past. In other words, there is a distinction to be made between \u0026rsquo;the past\u0026rsquo; and ways of talking about this past. If this distinction (between \u0026rsquo;the past\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;ways of talking about it\u0026rsquo;) is accepted, then we can answer the question about what history is thus: it is a way of talking about the past\u0026ndash;a \u0026lsquo;scientific\u0026rsquo; way. That is, the truths of historiography are established using the methods and techniques widely accepted in that domain. The past can be talked about not only by using historiographical methods, but also in different ways: the way stories, legends, drama, poetry, etc do. These are also ways of talking of the past but they lay no claims to being histories (or they do not claim to be \u0026lsquo;historiographies\u0026rsquo;). What is the status of the Bible?

We see the movement of the sun on the horizon and, for a very long period of time, people thought that they observed this because that is the way the reality is: the sun moves around the earth. With Galileo Galilei, two things happened. (a) He argued that the earth moves round the sun. (b) On the basis of this theory, he claimed that we are compelled to observe the movement of the sun around the earth. Because of this, a distinction became necessary: the movement of the sun is merely a phenomenon, whereas the movement of the earth is the real truth. What we previously thought as reality became downgraded to a mere appearance and something we did not know until then became the reality underlying this appearance. Of course, appearance is as much a part of Reality as the essence (or underlying reality, or whatever terminology you feel like using) is. So, we have three notions: appearance, the underlying reality, and the Reality that unites appearance with the underlying reality. (One might as well call them reality1, reality2 and reality3. But one does not do this because of the deep-rooted western metaphysical assumption that there is only one reality. However, since I do not want to quarrel with this assumption now, I will make no further remarks on this issue.)\nNotice though that this degradation of what was once thought of as reality to appearance is acceptable (and possible) because Galileo proves that one is compelled to observe the movement of the sun on the horizon precisely because of the motion of earth around the sun. That is, he shows that the movement of the sun is a necessary appearance.\nConsider now another everyday phenomenon: human beings are intentional. That is, each one of us experiences oneself as a being that wishes, dreams, hopes, desires, fears, sets up projects, pursues ambitions, etc. In short, it is our experience that we are intentional agents. All of Semitic theology, most of western philosophy and psychology and all of our commonsense assume the truth of this experience. This, if you like, is the reality that Homo Erectus Erectus is. This is what we experience and we experience this, we believe, because it is the reality.\nSome have found it fit to challenge this. Mostly, within the western intellectual traditions, it is called \u0026lsquo;reductionism\u0026rsquo;. Reductionism (Mind-body reductionism, as it is called) claims the following: every set of claims about the mind can, in principle, be reduced to another set of claims about brain-events. From this claim, they believe that it is possible to show that there cannot be such an entity called \u0026lsquo;mind\u0026rsquo;. (I want to leave aside what they mean by \u0026lsquo;reduction\u0026rsquo; not only because it has a technical meaning in the literature but also because it is not relevant for the purposes of illustration. The same applies to the different varieties of reductionism and the complexity of the arguments.)\nPhilosophical reductionism merely tells me that I am wrong (and hallucinate) each time I experience \u0026lsquo;myself\u0026rsquo; and feel \u0026lsquo;my\u0026rsquo; frustrations, ambitions, projects, etc as \u0026lsquo;mine\u0026rsquo;. Even where I accept that this reductionistic claim is true, there my experience does not change: I continue to experience whatever I experienced before and this explanation does not transform my experience. By reading their tracts, or writing their articles, one does not stop dreaming, or hoping, or desiring, or acting as moral agents. Philosophical reductionism merely tells me that the whole of mankind is deluded without having a hypothesis about why, if we are under the illusion that we are intentional creatures, we are compelled to live with this illusion, where it comes from, how it reproduces itself, how to get rid of them and so on. These theories blandly assure us that we are all deluded, and no more than that.\nNone would have taken Galileo\u0026rsquo;s theory seriously, if we had blandly assured us that all of us are deluded in observing the motion of sun on the horizon. The same with respect to these reductionist theories. There is no reason to take them seriously in their present form.\nWhat do they have to do, if they have to be taken seriously? They have to tell us not merely where this illusion of being an intentional creature and a moral agent comes from but, more importantly, whether and how we can be rid of this illusion. This is the requirement for any scientific theory regarding this issue. However, one point is worth noting at this stage: because being an intentional creature (i.e. a creature which hopes, dreams, desires, etc) is experiential in nature, any explanation that claims the contrary should help us experience the illusory nature of intentionality as well.\nHere is where the Indian traditions step in: they fulfill precisely this condition. They do not merely tell us where the illusion of being an intentional agent comes from, why they are reproduced, and how I can get rid of them. (I might or might not accept their claims about previous births. As a matter of fact, I do not. But clearly they have tried to answer these questions.), but help you experience its illusionary nature as well. In other words, the Indian traditions \u0026lsquo;save\u0026rsquo; my experience and do not deny it. They are scientific, in the best sense of the term. (In the sense I have just outlined.)\nBecause of this, much like Galileo\u0026rsquo;s theory, the reality of being an intentional creature is degraded to the level of appearance. (Or, say, reality1.) That one is not an intentional creature is the underlying reality. (Or, say, reality2.) The ultimate reality (or, reality3) unifies the appearance (reality1) with the underlying reality (reality2).\nIf one looks at the issue this way, the question \u0026lsquo;how does one know that one has discovered a higher reality?\u0026rsquo; answers itself. In exactly the same way we know about these things in scientific endeavors. There is nothing \u0026lsquo;mystical\u0026rsquo; or \u0026rsquo;esoteric\u0026rsquo; about the Indian traditions. They are the sciences of some aspects of the kind of creatures we human beings are.\nAddendum:\nQuestion: What is your present take on mind-body problem\u0026ndash;esp mind-body reduction and mental causation? Which thesis does your enlightenment support? Epiphenomenal emergentism? Please also address intentionality and phenomenal consciousness.\nEnlightenment does not address this problem at all; it is, in a specific sense, indifferent to this problem. Consciousness is a natural phenomenon of certain kinds of organisms. Intentionality, in all probability, indexes the presence of personhood. Hence, the fuss made around it. The ‘Self’ is an emergent property but it is not an epiphenomenon. If intentionality is seen as person-related capacities (to hope, to dream, to have projects, to have ambitions, etc.), then they disappear with enlightenment. If it is seen as ‘aboutness’, i.e., the abilities to talk about the world, to have beliefs, there is nothing mysterious about these abilities, even if we do not yet know what this ‘aboutness’ is.\n","tags":[],"title":"Mind-body reductionism and Indian traditions –S.N.Balagangadhara","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/mind-body-reductionism-and-indian-traditions-s-n-balagangadhara/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","criticism"],"content":"Criticism: I use jargon and twisted arguments on a mundane topic.

First, what do I say? That he calls it as corruption has to do with western normative ethics. Does it follow from this that the action of the municipal clerk is ethically good? It does not, unless one assumes either (a) I am presenting an alternate moral principle, which will make the action of the clerk morally good; or that (b) the only morality that will make the action of the clerk ethically bad is the one that construes it as corruption. I am not presenting an alternate moral rule that justifies the action of the clerk. But I want to know why the so-called corruption comes about and whether it is that. My attempt at doing this is assumed to make the action of the clerk or the building contractor morally good. Why this assumption? I suggest that it comes about because of the assumption (b).\nSecondly, consider the underlying rhetorical force of the counter-example: \u0026ldquo;even we Indians call it ethically bad\u0026rdquo;. But whoever said that the action of the clerk or the building contractor is ethically good? Did I say that we do not have notions of adharma or paapa? I did not; so why does he assume that my reconstruction to explain corruption of the clerk is an exoneration of the clerk\u0026rsquo;s action?\nSo, it appears that there are but two options open to me: either I condemn it as corruption or I am doomed to defend the action as morally good. This is how the issues get set up in the normative ethics. The possibility that one can criticize the clerk or the contractor without making it into corruption and yet call it unethical is not even entertained. When vaguely entertained, it becomes a matter of labels as one puts it. The problem, though, is that this label makes all the difference about how we tackle it: whether as a social phenomenon or as something else. That is to say, it is not a label which is at stake but one of re-conceptualizing ethics. Is there the problem of corruption in India that makes about 20% of the adult Indian population into immoral people, or is something else going on? Surely, there is something wrong with a theory that makes us massively immoral but leaves the western culture intact. This is the issue I wanted to focus on. But such is the logic of the western normative ethics that there is little possibility of discussing it without being forced either into a defense of immorality or into the assumption that normative condemnation is the only way of conducting an ethical discussion.\nTrue, I have not offered an alternate theory either of ethics or of corruption. The first will very soon (I hope) come out as a book, and research is needed on the second. I claim that we need to do research on this phenomenon, but others know what the phenomenon is without doing any such research. Where do they get this certainty from? From two things, I would like to suggest. One from the conviction that the clerk and the contractor are being unethical (but this is not being discussed); second from the belief that the moral talk that has made this into corruption is also the only talk that will make it unethical. To challenge that it is corruption is to doubt its immorality. In other words, the only way of indulging in moral talk is to talk the way the western ethics does.\nThe above are one\u0026rsquo;s cognitive assumptions, probably not those one is aware of making.\n","tags":[],"title":"Logic of normative ethics: Immorality","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/logic-of-normative-ethics-immorality-s-n-balagangadhara/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","normative"],"content":"The universalisability of norms does not mean that the western people all factually follow these norms.

I suppose it depends on the person with whom you are having a conversation, the context and the language used.\nWhy is this distinction useful? This article tries to show that some logical conclusions (about our social structure, about the nature of ethics) follow if we use the word \u0026lsquo;corruption\u0026rsquo; the way it is used to describe the Indian society. I am not willing to buy any of them. That is why I resist using the word corruption to describe the action of the municipal clerk or the building contractor or whoever else. This is the first reason. (I use a variant of the reductio et absurdum argument to show why we better make the distinction.)\nThere is a second reason. Let us continue using the examples of the clerk or the building contractor or a telephone linesman. The bribes you pay do not merely line the pockets of these individuals without them being distributed within the hierarchy of whatever organization to which these people belong (the clerk and the linesman) or the one to whom (say the assistant engineer) the contractor has paid. You do realize, of course, that there is an enormous integrity within this hierarchy. The bribes are distributed among the relevant people in a very honest way. Not only that. Once one pays the bribe, one feels that one is morally entitled to the service one has paid a bribe for. The one who receives the bribe also feels that he is morally obligated to provide you with the necessary service once he has received the bribe. You are not cheated from this entitlement once you have paid the bribe. What you get is what you pay for. These index the extraordinary integrity of the bribe-receiving structures. In fact, these individuals lose their credibility and trustworthiness (look at the words I am using) if they do not perform after they have received the bribe. That is, a tremendous trust and honesty is required from both the parties. It is almost as though that in this \u0026lsquo;perverse\u0026rsquo; (these scare quotes are red flags) system, there is an extraordinary honesty and integrity. Why, if they were corrupt, could they not tell you to take a hike after they receive bribes? Because, the so-called corruption works if and only if those who are \u0026lsquo;corrupt\u0026rsquo; are honest and reliable!\nThe above is the second side to the so-called corruption in the Indian society. What I am trying to do is make us realize that, because the so-called corruption involves both honesty and bribes, to figure out what this phenomenon is requires that we go beyond mere ethical characterizations the way the western culture uses them.\nTo repeat myself, let us first find out what this phenomenon is which involves both these dimensions. To simply call it corruption not only has implausible consequences but also blinds us to the issues.\nThese are two of the reasons why I want to distinguish between ethically bad action and corruption. There are more, but they are irrelevant in the present context.\nPrecisely because I was talking to a non-western, and presumably an Indian audience, I did not speak of the second aspect to corruption. To a western audience, that would have been my first point. In a very simplified fashion, I would have said, using the word corruption to describe a social phenomenon in India leads one to say the following: Indian society is corrupt if and only if the \u0026lsquo;corrupt\u0026rsquo; Indians are individually ethically good. (Each \u0026lsquo;corrupt\u0026rsquo; individual has to be extraordinarily ethical, if corruption has to work at a social level.) However, a \u0026lsquo;corrupt\u0026rsquo; individual cannot be ethically good. The problem I have had with the western audience is that they do not believe that corruption \u0026lsquo;works\u0026rsquo;. They are simply hung up on its alleged immorality.

There are some attempts to develop \u0026ldquo;ethical relativism\u0026rdquo;, even though it is not clear what is relativistic about them. One would be a kind of factual claim: different people, different groups, different cultures have different principles which they consider as \u0026ldquo;morally good\u0026rdquo;. This does not make for ethical relativism. The issue still remains: are these principles also ethically good? That is to say, one undertakes a \u0026rsquo;normative\u0026rsquo; enquiry in order to find out whether all these principles are also morally acceptable. The second would be to come up with a moral norm that is \u0026lsquo;relative\u0026rsquo; to some person or group. Any examination would very quickly lead to the conclusion that, in so far as it is a norm, it is universalizable even if the domain of objects appears restricted.

The \u0026lsquo;relativistic\u0026rsquo; norms appear relativistic because they specify the domain explicitly.) In other words, no one has been able to come up with any coherent explication of what \u0026lsquo;relativistic ethics\u0026rsquo; means.

As you know, Confucius wrote his \u0026ldquo;Analects\u0026rdquo; in the Classical Chinese language. In order to see where I am heading, consider some of the thoughts that Rosemont, Jr. expresses. (Rosemont, Jr., H., \u0026ldquo;Against Relativism.\u0026rdquo; In Larson G. J. and E. Deutsch (eds.), Interpreting Across Boundaries: New Essays in Comparative Philosophy. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1988) Not only is there an absence of the concept of \u0026lsquo;morality\u0026rsquo; in the Classical Chinese, but also the very cluster of concepts required to speak about moral issues.\nConsider as a specific example the classical Chinese language in which the early Confucians wrote. Not merely does that language contain no lexical item for \u0026lsquo;moral\u0026rsquo;, it also does not have terms corresponding to \u0026lsquo;freedom\u0026rsquo;, \u0026rsquo;liberty\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;autonomy\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;individual\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;utility\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;rationality\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;objective\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;subjective, \u0026lsquo;choice\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;dilemma\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;duty\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;rights\u0026rsquo;, and probably most eerie of all for a moralist, classical Chinese has no lexical item corresponding to \u0026lsquo;ought\u0026rsquo; - prudential or obligatory (Rosemont Jr. 1988: 61).\nThis claim is as puzzling as it is startling: in classical Chinese it is not possible to speak of \u0026lsquo;moral duty\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;moral dilemmas\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;moral choices\u0026rsquo;. It is not even possible to formulate a rule which uses the notions of \u0026lsquo;ought\u0026rsquo; - either obligatory (\u0026ldquo;All ought to do X\u0026rdquo;) or prudentially (\u0026ldquo;If one desires X then one ought to do Y\u0026rdquo;). In the western intellectual tradition, we believe it to be the \u0026rsquo;essence\u0026rsquo; of a moral principle or norm that it is formulated using the \u0026lsquo;ought\u0026rsquo; - either in obligatory or prudential form. Without \u0026lsquo;ought\u0026rsquo;, there would be no difference in kind between factual and evaluative statements. Yet, it is impossible to do precisely that in Confucianism. The philosophical significance is immense:\nSpeakers (writers) of languages that have no terms (or concept clusters) corresponding to \u0026lsquo;moral\u0026rsquo; cannot logically have any moral principles (ibid.: 60).\nBut, rightly enough, we take Confucianism at least as an example of a moral system. What is the upshot of the above remark? Rosemont formulates the issue as follows:\nIf one grants that in contemporary western moral philosophy \u0026lsquo;morals\u0026rsquo; is intimately linked with the concept cluster elaborated above, and if none of that concept cluster can be found in the Confucian lexicon, then the Confucians not only cannot be moral philosophers, they cannot be ethical philosophers either. But this contention is absurd; by any account of the Confucians, they were clearly concerned about the human conduct, and what constituted the good life. If these are not ethical considerations, what are? (ibid.: 64).\nThe intriguing question, apart from the truth-value of these claims, is about their intelligibility. What is the structure of the moral domain if it is not defined by norms? If one does not act morally simply by \u0026lsquo;following rules\u0026rsquo;, how does one learn to act in a moral way? How is an ethical judgment possible without referring to norms? How are ethical disputes settled? And, above all, how is an identification of such a domain possible at all?\nWhat I am trying to say is that these questions arise typically (at the least) in all Asian traditions, including the Indian one. And that what has been argued as the weakness of these traditions is actually their greatest strength.\n","tags":[],"title":"Moral domain not defined by norms","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/moral-domain-not-defined-by-norms-s-n-balagangadhara/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","normative"],"content":" Are western traditions innately richer because they have the moral ought? My answer: No. In fact, in my book on ethics I will prove the following: the non-normative ethics are richer: Under specific assumptions, in limited conditions, one can derive a normative ethics from a non-normative one. The relation between non-normative ethics and normative ethics is analogous to the relation between Einsteinian theory and Newtonian theory: under specific assumptions, in limited conditions, you can derive the Newtonian theory from the Einsteinian theory.\n\u0026ldquo;Uchit\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Unuchit\u0026rdquo; do not function as \u0026lsquo;ought\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;ought not\u0026rsquo; do. They mean something like appropriate and inappropriate. That we have different words with different meanings to pick out the moral \u0026lsquo;ought\u0026rsquo; and moral \u0026lsquo;ought not\u0026rsquo; suggests (merely suggests!) that, perhaps, there is a greater richness to our ethical languages than those governed by the moral ought and moral ought not.\nWe can neither map the moral imperatives (let me call the \u0026lsquo;ought\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;ought not\u0026rsquo; this way in order to avoid using scare quotes to mention these words) at the phrase level or at a sentence level. What we \u0026lsquo;map\u0026rsquo; are the ethical nature and the ethical force of some statements in some context or the other.\nYes, many systems of Deontic logics make use of one or another version of modal logics. They enrich the propositional and predicate logics with deontic terms (which the moral imperatives are) and allow us to track the logical and semantic behavior of these deontic operators.\nDecidability presupposes expressibility and, as you say, the converse does not hold. (See §1.) The trade-off between the two depends on what human situations require: a decision-procedure or a learning-heuristic. The western ethics sees the ethical event as one that requires a decision procedure; it is my claim that in our traditions an ethical event requires an action heuristic.\nWhich is better? This does not depend on the semantics of ethical languages but on what ethics is supposed to do*:* teach you how to act ethically, or decide which type of action is ethical. In the latter case, you still have the problem of performing the ethically correct action.\n","tags":[],"title":"Is Normative Ethics Richer?","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/is-normative-ethics-richer-s-n-balagangadhara/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","colonial consciousness","corruption","normative"],"content":"The first thing to note is that there is no distance between how we use corruption in our daily language and the way it is used in political and sociological theories of corruption. You see, the problem we (Indians) face is the asymmetry in the way the word is used while talking about us and the way it is used when talking about India. I want to signal this by putting up the red flag: I want to suggest the reader not to assume the truth of these descriptions.\nIf we restrict ourselves to the recent past, then Gunnar Myrdal\u0026rsquo;s The Asian Drama can be used as a reference point for a way of talking that signals the current use of the term. He claimed that corruption (among other things) stood in the way of economic development of these countries. Since then, it has entered the popular discourse to such an extent that corruption is almost seen as a typical problem of developing countries today.\nConsider the fact that you complain that one has to pay bribe to get a duplicate of one\u0026rsquo;s birth-certificate from the municipal office. Why do you complain? Is it because you have to pay money? If you had to pay for any and every such duplicate by law, would you call it corruption as well? (In Belgium, one has to pay for these things over and besides the taxes one pays for organizing public services.) I presume not. Then why do you complain? Because, I suggest, you assume that (a) the clerk is not doing you any personal favor; (b) he is paid by the tax-payer\u0026rsquo;s money to provide you the service free of charge; (c) he is violating some or another moral precept by charging for what ought to really be free; and such like. If this is the case, it is these assumptions that are responsible for transforming his action into corruption. These are (a) moral assumptions about some or another set moral codes; (b) moral assumptions about the role and function of public offices; (c) moral assumptions about the duties that such a function imposes on the incumbent; and so on. All of these belong to what I have been calling the western normative ethics. In other words, your complaint is a moral one, and it is that thanks to the western normative vocabulary that is available to you through the use of English and the western education.\nLet us assume, for a moment, that this clerk\u0026rsquo;s function was privatized. (After all, why should I or someone else pay for this clerk so that you may get your duplicates?) That is, only those who make use of his office pay for the services they receive. Assume that the clerk charges you a fixed rate by keeping in mind he has to live too and not everybody in the community wants duplicate birth-certificates every day. (To keep the discussion simple, let us assume that the amount is fixed by him.) Would you call this corruption as well? I suppose not.\nIf you think deep enough on these two modes of organizing public services, you will notice the problem. The clerk acts as though he is doing the second, whereas he appears to belong to the first. The problem of \u0026lsquo;corruption\u0026rsquo; in India, I want to submit, arises due to the superimposition of the first on the second.\nIf this is the case, it ceases being corruption in any sense of the term. Hence my scare quotes as signals. It is intended to signal that the western normative ethics is structuring our experience itself, even when we think that we do not know what that normative ethics is all about. We need not study a western text-book on ethics in order to find out what it is. We merely need to interrogate the way we talk and the way (we think) we experience our own culture. What I have tried to do in the article is to draw your attention to the consequences of this way of structuring our experiences at a social and cultural level. In other words, I was hoping that these scare quotes would force one to interrogate one\u0026rsquo;s own experience.

Within the western normative ethics, the context is irrelevant to the process of deliberation. Maximally, what \u0026lsquo;contexts\u0026rsquo; do is create the so-called ethical dilemmas, i.e. situations where the moral principles conflict. \u0026lsquo;So-called\u0026rsquo;, because most ethical philosophers do not believe that ethical principles could, in principle, be in conflict. They ascribe the empirical conflict either to the insufficient information the agent has, or to the moral imperfection of the actual world, or to the absence of a good theory of ethics which creates a hierarchy of norms, or whatever else. That is because, within the western normative ethics, it is not possible for an ethical principle to impose an immoral obligation. If it does so, such a principle has to be immoral. (In a situation involving a moral dilemma, following any one ethical principle entails violating the other moral principle. In this sense, the first imposes an immoral obligation to violate the second.)\nOne of the most popular ways to account for a moral dilemma has been to speak of two kinds of obligations: a prima facie obligation and an actual obligation. Prima facie obligations refer to situations involving moral conflict (i.e. a moral dilemma). They say that this is merely an apparent conflict (i.e. a prima facie conflict) and not \u0026lsquo;real\u0026rsquo; at all. In a morally perfect world, they say, there could be no conflict of moral principles. So, all you have to do is \u0026lsquo;accept\u0026rsquo; that ours is a morally imperfect world, where it appears as though we have conflicting obligations when there could be no such conflicts between moral obligations. In simple terms: they say moral dilemmas tell us that we live in a morally imperfect world but nothing about the nature of moral principles. Moral principles could never in conflict. In other words, moral dilemmas are a curse on humankind; they show us that we are imperfect creatures.\nIf these ideas do not resonate with your understanding of morality, it shows that you do not know what \u0026lsquo;ought\u0026rsquo; means (philosophically speaking).\n","tags":[],"title":"Normative Ethics: Moral Dilemmas and Imperfect World","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/normative-ethics-moral-dilemmas-and-imperfect-world-s-n-balagangadhara/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","caste","colonial consciousness","corruption","immoral"],"content":" The first thing that is really striking involves what I will call the burden of proof. That is, I am being asked to prove that my assertions about corruption are true. In one sense, it appears an entirely reasonable demand to make: after all, one should not entertain gratuitous claims. But what seems to have escaped the attention of many is this: what precisely do I have to prove? Who has the burden of proof? 1.1. Let us strip the issue to its barest form. I am supposed to prove that we Indians are not corrupt, immoral and/or moral imbeciles. Without proof, is it difficult to accept these claims? But who has proved that we are any or all of these things? Not the western theorists, surely. Not any Indian either. All that exist are bare-bone assertions that some moral principles are violated in a systematic fashion in India. So, what exactly do I have to prove?\n1.2. It could be said that people will accept my theories only if I can prove them. But I am not presenting a theory of corruption or caste, surely. I am merely extending an invitation to start looking at things in a way that enables research. There are some things I have a partial insight about; I can share them with you. There are some things I have some hunches about; I can try and communicate them as clearly as I can. Where and when I have a theory about some things, I can present them to the scientific public in a form that is adequate. On those issues where I have hunches, insights and intuitions I can only go some distance.\n1.3. But then, it is not as though the western theorists have a well-worked theory about these issues either. No theorist has ever shown either why some ethical principles (whatever they are) ought not to be violated; what happens to a culture when such a thing happens; why it is not morally good (whatever that means) that these principles are violated. Which theorist has done (or ever did) a research on the Indian ethics that proves that we are immoral? No one. Yet, we do not ask proof of this; but, I have to prove we are not immoral. Which theory explains corruption in India, let alone the actions of a municipal clerk? None. Yet, I have to prove that this clerk is not corrupt. This is strange: there is no burden of proof imposed on those who call India a corrupt nation, but one has to prove that India is not corrupt. If I say that America is corrupt, I have to prove it and no silly anecdote will do in its stead; but if I come with silly examples of India, it suffices. Have we reflected on this strange cognitive asymmetry in imposing the burden of proof?\nWhen for more than 200 years, the West went around trumpeting the \u0026rsquo;evils of the caste system\u0026rsquo;, we meekly accepted it without asking for proof. We inanely repeat the demand that the \u0026lsquo;Harijans\u0026rsquo; be allowed into the temples, without even knowing why or whether this demand entails abolishing the evil that the caste system is supposed to be or where this demand originated from or even what it signifies. Even to this day, when the Hindu \u0026lsquo;reform\u0026rsquo; groups go around peddling silly stories about the evil that the caste system is, we do not lay the burden of proof of them. But when someone asks what that system is, and whether we could have moral opinions on a subject we know very little about, the burden is on him to prove his claims. One has to prove that we Indians are ignorant of the Indian caste system; but, I suppose, if one says it is evil then the person demonstrates his knowledge.\nMany are telling me what I have to \u0026lsquo;show\u0026rsquo;, or \u0026lsquo;prove\u0026rsquo; if I want to be believed. Friends, I cannot (at this moment) prove that Indian culture is not immoral, or that we are not moral imbeciles. Nor am I am asking you to believe that Indians are not immoral. You can believe what you feel like: if like some, you are \u0026ldquo;ashamed of our barbarism\u0026rdquo;, so be it. I am not going to (nor am I able to) prove to you that we are \u0026ldquo;civilized\u0026rdquo; or that we are \u0026ldquo;cultured\u0026rdquo;. I believe that the burden of proof lies on those who make such implausible claims about non-western cultures. I cannot hope to convince you by providing proofs: I have no such proofs. All I can do is draw your attention to the fact that those who call us \u0026ldquo;barbaric\u0026rdquo; have even less to go on than I have. If people are already convinced about corruption in India, there is nothing I can do to dispel this conviction except draw attention to the fact that it does not rest on any kind of a proof either. All it draws upon is some moral principle and some subjective feeling induced by some anecdote or the other. I ask for research into corruption because, I say, we do not understand it. But if your conviction tells you that you are against such a research, there is pretty little I can do about it.\nThe only thing I can do is help you think about the possible reasons why we show the kind of resistance we exhibit. I have some ideas about why our intellectuals have not done the kind of research they should have done. I can share these ideas with you: not to convince you but to help you reflect. I do that because I feel that you might be open to thinking about our culture and our traditions in a different way than our earlier generations. I might be wrong in assuming this, but that is irrelevant. However, what I cannot do is prove to you that you need to think differently. I can give my reasons why I think a Renaissance is due.

All westerners are perfectly fully moral. All Indians are immoral. All westerners are immoral. For sentences (1) and (2), all it takes is one instance of immorality to be proven wrong. Our proverbial municipal clerk would be immoral, and it would disprove the sentence (1). The same example could also confirm sentence (3); an instance of a moral act would also be a counter-example.\nNow, when the municipal clerk is brought out as an instance, what exactly is its status? Is it intended as an example of (3) or as a counter example to (1)? Probably neither, because no one believes either (1) or (3). Consequently, it can illustrate another claim:\nSome Indians are immoral. This is undisputed; and we all take (5) to be true. In fact, we all believe Some westerners are immoral. Or, more generically, There are immoral people in both the west and India. So, the municipal clerk (and something analogous in the west) would be seen as a confirmation of the sentence (7). Since nobody is disputing this, and yet there is a dispute about the municipal clerk, the sentence (7) is not at issue either.\n(B) Let us see whether the issue is about corruption. To begin with, let us simply say that \u0026ldquo;immorality=corruption\u0026rdquo;. But this time, let us begin with the following sentence:\nSome Indians are corrupt. No argument from any one. (To me, this is true as much as the claim: some westerners are corrupt, some Africans are corrupt, some Asians are corrupt and some American-Indians are corrupt.) The dispute about the municipal clerk cannot be with respect to the above either. How about\nAll Indians are corrupt. Most of us disagree with this; most of us do not believe it to be true either. Therefore, the municipal clerk example is not seen by any of us as an example of sentence (9).\nSo, if the example of the municipal clerk, or the building contractor, is not an example of either (8) or (9), what else is it an example of or counter example to? Logically, there is only one option left:\nNo Indian is corrupt. But every one of us, including me, believe sentence (8) to be true. From this it follows that (10) is false. To make it clear, I do not subscribe to sentence (10) at all.\nSo, we are left with a problem. If there is consensus among us about which of the above sentences are true, and which are false, why are we still disputing? Why do people feel obliged to come with instances like the municipal clerk or the building contractor? What is it an example of, what is it a counter-example to? What precisely are we disputing?\n(C) There is also another common agreement because of the definitional equivalence. All acts of corruption and ethics are individual acts, i.e., individuals are either corrupt (immoral) or not corrupt (moral). So, we cannot be disagreeing about this either. So, why do people feel the urge to come with some or another instance, some argument or the other, and have a dispute with me? Where do we disagree?\n(D) The next step is to break the definitional equivalence. Two of the issues about which there could be a dispute (of the possible four):\nSome corrupt acts are moral.\nSome non-corrupt acts are not immoral.\nAbout the sentence (11). If you use your Indian psychology, you can think of any number of such situations. Imagine that the clerk is looking after abandoned children of prostitutes, helping in their education, keeping them away from the streets and crime. Imagine further too that he asks bribe only from those he thinks are capable of paying them and this money goes entirely to feed these children. Is your Indian psychology willing to call this clerk corrupt? Or even unethical?\nBut whatever it may be, the clerk and the building contractor could not be about this: I kept insisting that one is not defending that corruption is either morally good or bad, and that one needed to understand what it was before making a moral judgment either way.\nSo, what have we been discussing all along, and where is the dispute to be located?\n(E) Here is my hypothesis. The discussion has been about the sentence \u0026ldquo;corruption is a social phenomenon\u0026rdquo; and what we understand this sentence means. We are at loggerheads about the scope of this sentence. I believe you do not quite appreciate the consequences of your interpretation. Let me approach my hypothesis by steps as well.\n(F) Consider the following sentences:\n13 There are more corrupt Indians than there are corrupt westerners.\n14 There are more corrupt persons in India than elsewhere.\n15 In terms of the percentage of corrupt to non-corrupt people, India ranks 73rd in the list of nations.\nThese are some possible ways of interpreting the claim that \u0026ldquo;India is a corrupt nation\u0026rdquo;. None of these are acceptable because no research has been done by anyone, anywhere in the world, at anytime that can provide us with any semblance of evidence that can justify such a statement.\nQuite obviously, that claim that India is a corrupt nation (or that corruption is rampant in India) cannot refer to statements like above. Let us bring in the organization to which the municipal clerk belongs, in order to see whether it makes sense.\n16 The Indian bureaucracy is corrupt.\n17 In 72 other nations, bureaucracy is less corrupt.\n18 The bureaucracy in some countries is more corrupt than bureaucracy elsewhere.\n19 The manner in which the bureaucracy, the police, the justice system is corrupt in India is different from the way similar organisations are corrupt in the USA.\nThe sentence is (16) is true, but no implications follow from this. May be, that is because all bureaucracies are corrupt: because of Nehruvian Socialism in India, Fascism in Germany, Democracy in the US, etc. etc. In other words, the claim could be about the organization that the bureaucracy is. But, of course, it is not: no one means that only \u0026rsquo;the Indian bureaucracy is corrupt\u0026rsquo;, when they say that India is corrupt. Besides, no one has done a comparative research. So, we have no clue about what 17 through 19 say or do not say. Our dispute on this board, consequently, cannot be about any of the above sentences.\nSuppose we add government to this list. Consider the following:\n20 The Indian bureaucracy and the Indian government are corrupt.\n21 The existence of corrupt organizations makes a culture or a nation corrupt.\n22 If the society feeds corruption, such a society is corrupt.\nNow, I have a feeling we are getting somewhere in the process of making sense of the statement that India is a corrupt country. But, let us take small steps here. Regarding (21) and (22) the following could be said: the existence of organized crime in all societies would make all societies corrupt. But no one says that America is a corrupt nation because the organized crime exists and grows in America. So, let us leave aside these two sentences for the time being and focus on (20).\n23 The present incumbents in bureaucracy and government are corrupt.\nThis is not what is meant when one says that India is a corrupt country or that corruption is eating into the innards of the country. What one means is something stronger, more like,\n24 The Indian regime is corrupt: not merely the present incumbents but the Indian system of bureaucracy and politics.\nBut (24) does not imply that the rule of law and democracy are corrupt. These institutions are not corrupt.\n25 The way the Indians use these modern institutions is corrupt. Or, The Indian way is corrupt.\nWhat is this Indian way? Some kinds of examples.\n26 Such is the nature of corruption in India that anyone who has to do business in India is forced to play the same game.\n27 One cannot do business in India without paying bribes.\nIn other words, such is the Indian way that even those who want to play fair and square are forced into playing the game of corruption. These business people themselves get corrupted because, much like the building contractor, they are forced to pay bribes in order to stay alive.\n28 This means, that such is the pattern of interactions within the Indian society that anyone who wants to interact with them is forced to become corrupt himself. Or, pithily formulated,\n29 One is taught to relate in a corrupt way to other people.\nBoth (29) and (30) imply the following:\n30 One is not only corrupt; one corrupts the other as well. That is, \u0026rsquo;their\u0026rsquo; (i.e. the Indian) way of interacting breeds corruption.\nFrom this, it is a child\u0026rsquo;s play (almost) to go to the following conclusions:\n31 Corruption continues to grow in India because more and more people are taught to become corrupt.\n32 That is, more of more aspects of cultural life come under the scope of corruption.\n33 The process of learning to be corrupt is part of the Indian culture and society.\n34 A society or a culture teaches its members some ways of interacting with each other. If these ways are themselves corrupt, the society or nation is corrupt.\nIn other words, the commonsense claims (and the scholarly treatises) about \u0026lsquo;corruption in India\u0026rsquo; involve the above statements. This is what I think most of you are defending without knowing it (or even explicitly rejecting it). Why do I say so?\n(G) Because, now the examples of the clerk and the contractor begin to make sense. They are examples of the fact that India is corrupt. It does not mean the sentence (8) but sentences 30 through 35. You feel that I am saying something else, something different from the commonsense claims you are putting forward. Therefore, you keep coming with examples and arguments that make no sense, have no point or purpose, at first sight. But they do make sense. If you realize that a \u0026lsquo;simple\u0026rsquo; statement like that of the Transparency International has its own logic and takes you irresistibly towards one goal, you will also realize that your examples and arguments have but one purpose: to \u0026lsquo;show\u0026rsquo; that India is corrupt in the sense we have just seen.\n(H) When immorality increases in the West, people do not say the \u0026lsquo;west is an immoral culture\u0026rsquo; because it encourages immorality. They bemoan this fact and say that the \u0026lsquo;fundamental\u0026rsquo; western values (or Christian values) need to be revived. When immorality (say corruption) increases in India, people do not say the same and call for a revival of Indian values. No, they say that the Indian culture and society are corrupt. Why? Because the values that the Indian society embody are not considered moral.\n(I) In other words, the discussions on this board illustrate the colonial consciousness I refer to in the article. Even when we want to, it is not that simple to break out of this consciousness. Even when we talk about our own experiences in India, we remain within the ambit of colonized consciousness. Because, \u0026ldquo;Colonialism\u0026rdquo;, as I have repeated a number of times already, \u0026ldquo;is about denying the colonized peoples and cultures their own experiences; of making them aliens to themselves; of actively preventing any description of their own experiences except in terms defined by the colonizers.\u0026rdquo;\n(J) I am, of course, aware that I have sketched out but a path in the above paragraphs. This is not the only path, but one I found to be the simplest to show the logic involved in the statement that \u0026lsquo;India is corrupt\u0026rsquo;. I say your discussions suggest that you are merely following the logic of this statement. By saying this, I might alienate some of you. If that comes to pass, so be it. As I have said in another post, I can only help you think, I cannot convert you. You need to put in the effort and all I can provide are some tips.\nNotes:\nI do wish sometimes that people read this post carefully before expressing agreements or disagreements. Just before the sentence (8), I postulated a definitional equivalence between immorality and corruption. In that case, \u0026lsquo;some Indians are immoral\u0026rsquo; becomes equivalent to \u0026lsquo;some Indians are corrupt\u0026rsquo;. As such, there can be no scare quotes in sentence (8). On the other hand, the scare quotes will reappear when one suggests that Indians are \u0026lsquo;corrupt\u0026rsquo; in the sense in which one proclaims that \u0026lsquo;India is a corrupt nation\u0026rsquo;. Because, here the notion of \u0026lsquo;corruption\u0026rsquo; carries the meaning I have dealt with in sentence (31) to (34).\n","tags":[],"title":"Colonial Consciousness: The Logic of “India is Corrupt”","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/colonial-consciousness-and-the-logic-of-india-is-corrupt-s-n-balagangadhara/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","caste","colonial consciousness","corruption","immoral","normative","published","Sulekha"],"content":"One of the striking things about the British colonial rule is its success in developing certain ways of talking about the Indian culture and society. The British criticised the Indian \u0026lsquo;religions\u0026rsquo;, the Indian \u0026lsquo;caste system\u0026rsquo;, the Indian education system, practices like \u0026lsquo;sati\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;untouchability\u0026rsquo;, and so on and so forth. They redrew the outlines of Indian intellectual history as indigenous responses to some of the ills they saw in the Indian society and culture: for example, \u0026lsquo;Buddhism\u0026rsquo;, as it emerged out of their reconstruction, was a revolt against \u0026lsquo;Brahmanism\u0026rsquo; and \u0026rsquo;the caste system\u0026rsquo;. Many Indian intellectuals emphasized British criticism by making \u0026rsquo;truths\u0026rsquo; in the latter their own: the Arya Samaj, the Brahmo Samaj, many Hindu \u0026lsquo;reform\u0026rsquo; movements, and so on exemplify this trend. I say \u0026rsquo;truths\u0026rsquo; and place it in scare quotes because the unbroken line of continuity between the colonial period and the one following the Indian independence raises two kinds of questions. The first is this: would there have been such a line of continuity if there was no \u0026rsquo;truth\u0026rsquo; to the British portrayal of our history, traditions, and culture? This question uses the \u0026lsquo;fact\u0026rsquo; of continuity to suggest that the British descriptions could be \u0026rsquo;true\u0026rsquo;. That is, our current experience of our culture and society appears to lend truth-value to the colonial descriptions of India. The second question transforms our \u0026lsquo;current experience\u0026rsquo; itself into a problem: does such a line of continuity indicate that our experiences themselves are still colonial in nature? This question throws doubts upon the \u0026lsquo;facticity\u0026rsquo; of the British descriptions of India, and suggests that they could be \u0026lsquo;untrue\u0026rsquo;. In the process, it also challenges us to look more closely and investigate our own experiences today. That is, the second question withholds assent to the \u0026rsquo;truth\u0026rsquo; both of the colonial descriptions of India and of some of the claims we make about our experiences of our culture and society today. To some extent, and only to some extent, the so-called \u0026lsquo;post-colonial\u0026rsquo; writings can be seen as attempts to make sense of the second question. Even though I do not fancy the label of being a \u0026lsquo;post-colonial\u0026rsquo; myself, I perceive a shared sense of a quest with them. There is something deeply, deeply wrong with the line of continuity that exists between the colonial period and today\u0026rsquo;s India, and the challenge is to say what it is.\nParticipants in the Debate\nSomething more requires to be said about this \u0026rsquo;line of continuity\u0026rsquo; and I will do so by identifying the broad responses to the colonial descriptions of India. Let me begin with the event that colonialism is. To most of us, including the colonizers, this event appears to have taken the status of a historical proof of the cognitive superiority of one culture against the other. That is, for some reason or the other, we look at colonization as though it was a contest between two theories much like, say, the contest between the Aristotelian theory and that of Galileo. Our colonization by the British is seen to express the weakness of our culture and, by the same token, their superiority.\nMany explanations of this weakness float around. (a) India was never a nation before the British made us into one; (b) the weakness of the Mogul rule at that stage; (c) the caste-ridden, divisive society that India was; (d) the absence of a centralized state and the presence of multiple small kingdoms, (e) because of which the policy of the British to \u0026lsquo;divide and rule\u0026rsquo; was successful. There are many more than these five, but this list should suffice. \u0026ldquo;How could a few thousand conquer a nation of millions, if we were not weak?\u0026rdquo; This is how Gandhi formulated the problem, as did the Indian Independence Movement. Our nationalist thought has crystallized around the certainty that colonization expressed our weakness and the British strength (even if the latter was confined to exploiting this \u0026lsquo;weakness\u0026rsquo;).\nHowever, the above perception does not emerge from a scientific study of either colonialism or imperialism but from the rhetorical force of another question: \u0026ldquo;if colonization is not an expression of our weakness, what else is it? An expression of our \u0026lsquo;strength\u0026rsquo;?\u0026rdquo; Even though every historian can routinely assure us that \u0026lsquo;higher\u0026rsquo; civilizations can be conquered and overrun by \u0026lsquo;barbarians\u0026rsquo;, the so-called \u0026lsquo;scientific\u0026rsquo; studies into our history do not appear to have moved away from this rhetorical question. On the contrary. Such studies try to provide \u0026lsquo;insights\u0026rsquo; into our weakness, and tell us what the latter were. Simply put: the consensus (more or less) of all and sundry is that colonialism expressed the \u0026lsquo;weaknesses\u0026rsquo; of the colonized and the \u0026lsquo;strengths\u0026rsquo; of the colonizer. The industrial revolution in the West that antedates colonialism and the origin of the natural sciences that predates colonialism have somehow become telescoped in the popular consciousness into one state of affairs: the scientific, technological and the military might of the western culture. In short, colonialism expresses the civilizational superiority of the West. And, of course, the obverse of this conviction is: in many ways (in all ways?) we are inferior to the western culture. (The \u0026lsquo;we\u0026rsquo; picks out the Indian culture here.) This conviction expresses itself in a variety of forms: from the rigidly nationalistic framework to its diametrically opposed stance. Provocatively put: colonialism is seen as a contest between two theories; one has won out proving the other as false (or passé) thereby.\nThe above stance (conviction, attitude, call it what you will) generates two antithetical intellectual movements. (It is a kind of a pendulum swing during the course of the last two hundred years we are not rid of yet.) The first is a fiercely \u0026rsquo;nationalistic\u0026rsquo; mode. It claims that the Indian culture had everything: from quantum physics to psychoneuroimmunology, and from the rockets to the nuclear bombs. It further claims that there is nothing wrong either with \u0026rsquo;the caste system\u0026rsquo; or with the Indian \u0026lsquo;religions\u0026rsquo;. The second is its antithesis: it brands any attempt to interrogate the Indian traditions and the Indian culture in order to recover and understand our current experiences as \u0026lsquo;obscurantist\u0026rsquo; if not downright \u0026lsquo;fascist\u0026rsquo;. It believes that the current state of our society clearly shows the need for: \u0026lsquo;abolishing\u0026rsquo; the caste system because it is the cause of social injustice; \u0026lsquo;reforming\u0026rsquo; the Indian \u0026lsquo;religions\u0026rsquo; so that they become more responsive to the needs of the modern day world; \u0026rsquo;establishing\u0026rsquo; more firmly a \u0026lsquo;secular state\u0026rsquo; that guarantees the upholding of the liberal values, etc. Between these two extremes, there are a number of opinions (of various shades) that tell us that we should \u0026lsquo;absorb\u0026rsquo; the best from both cultures. However, these shades have been cognitively uninteresting so far.\nThere is, however, a third participant in this debate today. Standing outside the spectrum defined by these two antithetical movements, this voice suggests that both the responses are fundamentally colonial in nature. It suggests further that both ways of talking are obfuscating the nature of our experiences. It says that the Indians today have difficulties in accessing their own experiences, and that their learnt ways of talking about their culture and society are responsible for this state of affairs. It tries to argue that one needs to break out of the centuries of descriptive straight-jacket that confines our thoughts and distorts our experiences. It is, I believe, a voice of the future which pleads the case for an Indian Renaissance. I hope to make plausible why this voice is believable and is worthy of credence.\nThe Structure of the Article\nOn its own, this article cannot realize the hope I have just spoken of. It requires more than even a couple of books to go some way in achieving the objective. Consequently, I will be taking but a step in that direction. And I intend doing it by using an unorthodox literary strategy in a debate that actually involves multiple voices. The strategy is the following: I will deny voice to myself. Or, better put, I will play the ventriloquist: my voice will be lent to one of the strongest opponents in this debate. Who is this opponent and why this strategy?\nBy way of an answer, let me begin by \u0026lsquo;gendering\u0026rsquo; this voice: it is a he. He is a reasonable person but one who is logically very consistent. He shares the popular perceptions about the two banes of modern India, namely corruption and caste. Being a reasonable man, he wants a transparent government free of corruption and a just society that is rid of the socially unjust caste system. As a consistent person though, he follows his thoughts through to their logical conclusions and talks about the nature of Indian ethics as well. This reasonable and logical person is my opponent to whom I will lend my voice throughout this column and my own, at best, will be heard as interjections.\nThe readers of this column, I presume, share these popular perceptions as well. Whatever one\u0026rsquo;s sex, my portrayal of the commonsense perception should facilitate the reader in identifying oneself with this reasonable person. How far one goes along with this man depends on how consistent one wishes to be. For my part, I shall strive to make him maximally consistent. Consequently, the challenge the reader faces will be the following: would one like to be consistent and follow my opponent all the way through, or is one willing to interrogate afresh the commonsense perceptions of our society today? This strategy, if you like, is a variant of the famous reductio et absurdum. It is aimed at inducing what once was called \u0026lsquo;cognitive dissonance\u0026rsquo;. The ensuing discussion on the forum will make clear the degree of its success.\nThe Social Ethics of Corruption\nAccording to Transparency International\u0026rsquo;s Corruption Perceptions Index 2002, India ranks behind Columbia, Argentina, and Honduras and occupies the 73rd place in the list of \u0026lsquo;corrupt\u0026rsquo; countries. In India, the newspapers are full of stories about corruption and everybody knows somebody who is \u0026lsquo;on the take\u0026rsquo;. It is almost axiomatic that every politician is corrupt. The same applies to almost everyone in the government services – from the high-ranking officer to the lowest of the doormen. All state-owned enterprises (from electricity to the telephone) appear to suffer the same fate. Banking and Insurance sectors owned by the state seem to join the queue as well. If we simply add the numbers up, my guess is that we are talking about 80-100 million corrupt people (10% of the Indian population). Of course, this is what is visible in the media. Very little is written about the business-to-business corruption, where an entire hierarchy demands suitable homage from their suppliers, mostly small-scale businesses themselves. If you include \u0026lsquo;greasing palms\u0026rsquo; to get seats in \u0026lsquo;fully booked\u0026rsquo; theaters, private hospitals, or on trains and private airlines, or gain entry into the educational institutions to this list, we are probably talking about 150 million or more. Should the \u0026lsquo;black market\u0026rsquo; be drawn into the picture as well … it is anybody\u0026rsquo;s guess. (In all probability, we are now talking about 20% or more of the Indian population.) In short, corruption is as ubiquitous as the air we breathe in India and that, in most big cities, is much polluted. The media does not stop clamoring, the citizens do not stop complaining, and there is still no solution in sight. Commissions set up to punish the corrupt end up becoming corrupt themselves.\nBecause the distance between common sense and scholarship on this issue is virtually zero, let me cite a \u0026rsquo;netizen\u0026rsquo; talking about it.\n\u0026ldquo;Corruption is destroying the innards of our country\u0026rdquo; (Vinay Sharma)\n\u0026ldquo;Customs officers raided, 29 lakhs recovered from a single officer!\u0026rdquo; If you\u0026rsquo;ve been reading the newspapers about a month back, this was the hottest news item then. It is downright mind boggling, not in the least because you assumed customs too be a squeaky clean department but by the sheer amount of money a low level government officer can make in the right jobs. According to sources in the customs clearing business, the amount of speed money earned by an appraiser is nothing less than Rs.20,000 a day, and what the Asst. Collector takes home is almost Rs. 30,000 a day. Rs. 30,000 a day adds up to, hold your breath, a cool Rs. 1.2 crore per year, tax free!. No wonder a job as an Assistant Collector of Customs is hotter than a job as a Country Head of a high flying MNC. Not that the Assistant Collector of Customs gets to keep it all, part of it must be shared with equally corrupt seniors and powerbrokers who ensure you get the right job in the first place through their contacts in the Ministry. Nowadays you come across young men whose prime ambition in life is to take up a government job. This desire is not fuelled by an urge to do something for the country and it\u0026rsquo;s people but to fill one\u0026rsquo;s own pockets by harassing common people. These people form the first link in a vicious circle that includes government officials at all levels, powerbrokers, members of the legislature and parliament and even ministers. These are a few cogs turning the wheels of the parallel economy. Add to them the unscrupulous businessmen and the process of defrauding the nation is complete. At this junction let me clarify that there are exceptions to this rule albeit rare. Once in a while you come across a officer who is twiddling his thumbs being given a posting where he can do no harm, no harm to the vested interests of the honourable politicians and their flunkies. As far as the businessmen are concerned there are many who may have resisted succumbing to the unjustified demands of these so called officers and have suffered, their good being held up on flimsy grounds, official clearances not being given, the list is endless. The Indian Government has vested so much power in the officers that they can hold you to ransom and you are absolutely helpless. If you decide to approach the courts, be prepared for a wait of at least a decade or so by which time your business is all but closed and your family is out on the streets. The same story is repeated across all government departments. The government has now established the post of the Chief Vigilance Commissioner, the person responsible for tacking the menace of corruption in the country. The recent raid on the Customs officers in Mumbai is courtesy the CVC. The appointment of the CVC is a step in the right direction but when you see the sheer number of government departments and the number of government employees across India, you realise the enormity of the task. In my opinion much stronger measures are called for to stop the menace of corruption from destroying the innards of the country. These strong measures have to be taken us, the common people of the country. Can we demand for special courts for speedy trial of corruption cases, can we demand for tougher laws against corruption that lead to life imprisonment for corrupt officers and politicians. Of course no politician in his right mind would pass such a law would he? Should we boycott people known to be corrupt and if so are we prepared to bell the cat? Is there any resort for the common people of this country?\nThe author is a concerned common citizen of India\nOur \u0026lsquo;concerned common citizen\u0026rsquo;, even if he requires an Internet connection to publish his WebPages, tells us exactly what you hear on the streets, at the press club in Delhi, in the villages about the local Tahasildar\u0026rsquo;s office. Amazingly, the way one talks about fighting it is also identical: \u0026ldquo;Punish the corrupt severely,\u0026rdquo; but then who should do so? Quis Custodiet ipsos Custodes? \u0026ldquo;What we need is a strong entity (an individual or a government) that threatens, and punishes the errant – and then \u0026rsquo;they\u0026rsquo; will learn.\u0026rdquo; The \u0026rsquo;they\u0026rsquo;, of course, are the \u0026lsquo;corrupt\u0026rsquo; – as I say, about 20% or more of the population. 2.1. What is one saying when one says this? The logic of the word \u0026lsquo;corruption\u0026rsquo; tells us that either something or someone is corrupt – it is either a corruption of norms, or of values, or of principles, or of individuals … If we take our contemporary usage, corruption indicates a \u0026rsquo;loss of integrity\u0026rsquo; – whether of individuals or of your database. The same usage also tells us that \u0026lsquo;corruption is rampant in India\u0026rsquo;; that \u0026lsquo;corruption is a social phenomenon\u0026rsquo;; that \u0026lsquo;corruption is wide-spread in India\u0026rsquo; etc.\n2.2. If it is our experience that corruption has known a phenomenal growth since Independence, it can only mean that the social fabric or the social structure enables such a rapid growth. Our soil, so to speak, must be very conducive to the growth of a cancer that \u0026ldquo;eats into the innards of our country\u0026rdquo;. Indian society hosts this cancer, and its immunological mechanisms must be pretty ineffective in fighting against it. If the people of India constitute the cells of the country and if \u0026lsquo;corruption\u0026rsquo; is the disease, the only possible immunological mechanisms are the social and moral principles, of course. If Indians can so quickly, so easily and so massively be corrupted, what does it say about their morals? They should be pretty well non-existent, I would say. Or such is their morality that it encourages one to be immoral. When is a person a \u0026lsquo;fool\u0026rsquo; not to take bribes? In a situation where everyone else is corrupt. It is a successful social strategy: because everyone else is corrupt, it pays to be corrupt oneself. That is, in today\u0026rsquo;s India, it is rational to be immoral.\n2.3. How does one learn to be corrupt? In social groups, of course. If \u0026lsquo;being on the take\u0026rsquo; is a successful social strategy, then it follows that the social group from which an individual learns this must itself embody this strategy. That is, the social group must itself be corrupt. However, because \u0026lsquo;corruption\u0026rsquo; cuts across all empirical groupings in the Indian society, it follows that the \u0026lsquo;social group\u0026rsquo; in question must refer to the society at large. Such must be the nature of this society that the individual learns to be immoral in his going-about with his fellow human beings. In some appropriate sense of the term, the social structure must itself be corrupt.\nCaste – the Ethical Corruption\nIf much of the western description makes the caste system synonymous with India, caste also appears as ubiquitous to the Indians as the very air they breathe. From politicians to political pundits, from the pimps to the Prime Minister – all of us seem to belong to the caste system. Most intellectuals, from the extreme right to the extreme left, have firm opinions on the subject. Quite a few theories float around as purported explanations of the caste system. Some see a deformed class-relation in it, others a fossilised coalition of associations. Some see hygienic principles operative in the caste system, yet others some transaction rules. Some call it racial segregation, whereas others see in it the propensity of human beings to maximise fitness through extended nepotism. Whatever one\u0026rsquo;s thoughts on the subject, most intellectuals appear to agree that the caste system is an obsolete form of social organisation. Its obsolescence is indexed by the hindrance it offers to everything that is desirable: progress, economic development, social equality, and justice … Without exaggeration, it could be said to be the bane of our society and culture. The caste system epitomises everything that is bad and backward.\nWhy does it so stubbornly refuse to disappear? How to eradicate this impediment to progress? The existing answer, in both theory and practice, is surprisingly simple: the caste system persists because of \u0026lsquo;prejudice\u0026rsquo; and that is what one should remove. What kind of prejudice? Let us run through some of them quickly: the prejudice of \u0026lsquo;untouchability\u0026rsquo;; the prejudice that the accident of birth condemns one to servitude; the prejudice that the Brahmins belong to a superior \u0026lsquo;caste\u0026rsquo; because of \u0026lsquo;Karma\u0026rsquo;. … Not only is this a well-known list, so also are the anecdotes that accompany it: horror stories of discrimination against the Harijans by the upper-caste groups, denial of basic human rights to some people, refusal to allow entry into temples or to partake food and water, etc. As this anecdotal discourse progresses, it transpires that the caste system is virtually synonymous with untouchability, moral discrimination, the denial of human rights, and so on. That is, these (and allied) prejudices are instilled in people from their birth, and the caste system is kept alive through practising these prejudices. Very simply put: caste system is a set of immoral practices. 4.1. Let us get some grip on the extent of the immorality of the caste system by comparing it to other large-scale (immoral) phenomena we know. For example, discrimination against the minorities in the US is not a social organisation, even though it is a social phenomenon. The apartheid regime was both the policy of a government and a regime imposed on society, but it was not a social structure. Fascism was a political movement (and a state form) and was unstable. Caste system is, in some sense, all of these but is also much more. It has survived onslaughts from Buddhism, Bhakti movements, colonialism, the Indian reformers, the current Indian legislation, and the western theorists. Clearly, we have a unique, sui generis phenomenon on our hands. It is more evil than colonialism and the concentration camps, more widespread than ethnic discrimination, and has a longer history than slavery.\n4.2. However, when we say that the caste system is a set of immoral practices, we are actually saying at least two things: that these practices are immoral and that they are (logically or mathematically) ordered. (Actually we are saying more, but that does not concern us in here.) While one might be willing to grant that the practices (like the ones indicated above) are immoral, it might not be obvious why the caste system becomes an immoral system. The answer is simple: \u0026lsquo;caste\u0026rsquo; is an ordered and structured system. Any social organisation, if anything is a social organisation then the caste system is, is ordered and structured. The immorality of this social organisation consists in the fact that it imposes immoral obligations in an ordered and systematic way. That is to say, caste system is an immoral social order in this double way: not only does the practice of caste discrimination violate certain moral norms but, as a social order, it makes immorality obligatory.\n4.3. Let us now shift our attention to those belonging to the system. When is someone, anyone, immoral? Only when one willingly chooses to act in an immoral way. That is, the action has to be voluntary and must be the result of a choice in the presence of relevant alternatives. The caste system might impose immoral obligations, but each individual can choose not to follow them. Buddhism to the Bhakti movements illustrate this. From this, it follows that those who are within the caste system – and remain within it – are immoral (in a systematic way). Under this condition, except for the individual heroes who have opted out, all other Indians become immoral. (After all, there is caste division among the Christians, Harijans, and the schedules of the Indian constitution.)\nOne could weaken this conclusion by arguing that:\n(a) Not all obligations imposed by the caste system are immoral. Quite obviously, it makes no difference whether someone commits one immoral act systematically, or two or three.\n(b) The ideology of the caste system \u0026lsquo;hides\u0026rsquo; the immoral nature of its obligations. If you and I see through this cloak, as did the movements from Buddhism through Bhakti, those who do not see through the cloak must be intellectually weak. That is, they are immoral because of their intellectual deficiency.\n(c) The caste system is sold as \u0026rsquo;the natural law\u0026rsquo; (karma, for example) and those who accept it believe in rebirth and its rewards, moksha and such like. From this, it follows that all these doctrines justify immorality and are, therefore, immoral as well. In so far as these doctrines have to do with our \u0026lsquo;culture\u0026rsquo; (or \u0026lsquo;religions\u0026rsquo;), it follows too that our culture and its \u0026lsquo;religions\u0026rsquo; are fundamentally immoral as well.\n4.4. I do not want to go into all possible (and encountered) arguments. So, let me sum up. The caste system is the embodiment of ethical corruption. Such a stance requires that Indians are either immoral or cretins, and suggests that Indian \u0026lsquo;culture\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;religions\u0026rsquo; are immoral as well. The way the \u0026lsquo;masses\u0026rsquo; talk about corruption mimics the way the intelligentsia talks about caste and corruption: Indians are immoral and corrupt. Not merely that. In so far as corruption and caste are successful and rational strategies of social survival, the \u0026rsquo;norms\u0026rsquo; that generate such strategies must themselves be immoral. The conclusion is inescapable: Indian ethics must itself be immoral.\nThe Corrupt Ethics\nIn this part, I shall leave both the intelligentsia and the masses behind me, and focus instead on the intellectuals. To see what they say about the nature of Indian ethics, I need texts. Instead of picking up the Gita (or some such text), I want to focus on an unlikely candidate: The Kamasutra of Vatsyayana, with fourth century BCE as its likely date of composition. Considered a tract on erotic love, this compendium has a chapter titled, \u0026ldquo;Reflections on Intermediaries who assist the lover in his enterprises.\u0026rdquo; What kind of enterprises is being talked about? At least one among them includes relating to \u0026rsquo;those that belong to another\u0026rsquo; (p.77). The author(s) want to find out whether there are good \u0026lsquo;reasons for sleeping with other men\u0026rsquo;s wives\u0026rsquo;. Consider some of the good reasons for committing adultery that the Kamasutra gives us. (Actually, Vatsyayana often cites authorities, adds his own comments, etc. I shall ignore all these nuances and speak of \u0026lsquo;what the Kamasutra says\u0026rsquo; from now on.)\n\u0026ldquo;If the woman who loves me has a rich and powerful husband who is in touch with my enemy, she will arrange for her husband to injure him\u0026rdquo; (p.78). This is considered as a good reason for committing adultery.\n\u0026ldquo;If I am penniless, without any means of livelihood, and thanks to this woman, I can become rich easily, I will make love to her\u0026rdquo; (ibid) is an acceptable reason to seduce another man\u0026rsquo;s wife as well.\nWhat do you think of the two reasons provided in the next paragraph?\n\u0026ldquo;If a girl I desire is a dependent of hers, it is by establishing relations with her that I shall obtain the girl\u0026rdquo; or, alternately, \u0026ldquo;without sleeping with her, I shall never manage to obtain the young girl, difficult to approach, rich and beautiful, whom I would like to marry.\u0026rdquo; (p. 80) If all of the above constitute good reasons for committing adultery, how about this gem of an argument?\n\u0026ldquo;Once she has fallen in love with me, she may murder her husband and, having taken possession of his goods, we shall live together in luxury.\u0026rdquo; The author\u0026rsquo;s commentary explains: \u0026ldquo;united by the affection born of their relations, they league together to kill her husband, attacking him treacherously with a stick. Having accomplished his, they seize his goods. Either she or I kill the rest of the family. We can then benefit from everything we have been able to seize and live on the proceeds of what we have thus realized, without anything appearing illegal.\u0026rdquo; (p. 79) Apparently, the main worry is whether or not their acts \u0026lsquo;appear illegal\u0026rsquo; and not whether such actions are \u0026lsquo;moral\u0026rsquo;.\nBe it as that may, reasons such as these are considered \u0026lsquo;good\u0026rsquo; enough to commit adultery. They are good, in the sense that they are serious and not frivolous, and hence, one assumes, morally acceptable. In fact, one is warned: \u0026ldquo;However, unless one has serious reasons for doing so, it is better to avoid taking the risk of seducing other men\u0026rsquo;s wives for mere amorous dalliances.\u0026rdquo; (P. 80; my emphases.)\n5.1. You are British and have been educated in the proper schools. You come to India in the 19th century and encounter this text. How would you react? It makes perfect sense to you that such books are not only written, but are also considered \u0026lsquo;classic\u0026rsquo; texts. Why? Because of what you see around you. And what do you see? Here is a random example:\n… (C)ould I transplant my reader … to the purely native circle by which I am surrounded … and could he understand the bold and fluent hindostanee which the Hindoo soldier speaks, he would soon distinguish the sources of oriental licentiousness, and how unprincipled is the Hindoo in conduct and character. In nothing is the general want of principle more evident, than in the total disregard to truth which they show; no rank or order among them can be exempted from the implication. The religious teachers set the example, and they are scrupulously followed by all classes. Perjury and fraud are as common as is a suit of law; with protestations of equal sincerity will a witness stand forth who knows the falsehood of his testimony, and he who is ignorant of what he professes to testify. No oath can secure the truth; the water of the Ganges, as they cannot wash away the filth of lying and deceit, so they cannot preserve the court of law from being the scene of gross and impious contradiction. No task is so difficult as is he who would elicit truth from the mouth of a witness. Venality and corruption are universal; they are remarkable, too, for their ingratitude. (Massie, Vol. 1, 1840: 466-467.)\nThe modern-day intellectual might feel like protesting: Kamasutra is hardly an authoritative ethical treatise. How many have read it in any case? Besides, one could say, its \u0026lsquo;popularity\u0026rsquo; is more due to the British than to its intrinsic merits. A well-taken objection. Let us redress the situation.\n5.2. Enter Richard Shweder. A professor in Chicago, he is out to trace the evolution of morality cross-culturally. In the course of conducting a cross-cultural research into the growth of moral awareness, Shweder and his co-workers (Shweder, et.al., 1987) developed a questionnaire supposed to test the presence of several moral notions among their subjects. The contrasting cultures are the Indian and the American; the interviewees are both children and adults. From the list of the cases that Shweder uses, here are the first five – in order of perceived \u0026lsquo;seriousness of breach\u0026rsquo;, as judged by Hindu Brahman eight-year-olds:\nThe day after his father\u0026rsquo;s death, the eldest son had a haircut and ate chicken.\nOne of your family members eats beef regularly.\nOne of your family members eats a dog regularly for dinner.\nA widow in your community eats fish two or three times a week.\nSix months after the death of her husband, the widow wore jewellery and bright-colored clothes (Ibid. P.40).\nIt is important to note that, in India, while there was a consensus between the children and the adults regarding the first two cases (p.63), there was a lack of consensus only among children regarding the last three cases. Keeping in mind that they are ordered in terms of the \u0026lsquo;perceived seriousness of the breach\u0026rsquo;, we further come across (ibid., P.40):\nAfter defecation (making a bowel movement) a woman did not change her clothes before cooking.\nIn a family, a twenty-five-year-old son addresses his father by his first name.\nAnd, as the fifteenth,\na poor man went to the hospital after being seriously hurt in an accident. At the hospital they refused to treat him because he could not afford to pay (ibid).\n5.3. We can, I suppose grant the veracity (or the factual truth) of these statements. We can grant too that many Indians (both children and adults) would probably consider such actions not just as \u0026lsquo;paap\u0026rsquo; but as \u0026lsquo;mahapaap\u0026rsquo;. As the sequence of questions in the interview makes it clear, the respondents were asked to motivate (or clarify) their stance. A fragment from such interviews, applied to a hypothetical Brahmin adult should make the point clear.\n\u0026ldquo;1. Is the widow\u0026rsquo;s behavior wrong? (Yes, Widows should not eat fish …)\nHow serious is the violation? (A very serious violation…)\nIs it a sin? (Yes. It\u0026rsquo;s a \u0026ldquo;great\u0026rdquo; sin.) … \u0026quot; (p.43)\nLet us consider a similar fragment from a hypothetical American adult.\n\u0026ldquo;1. Is the widow\u0026rsquo;s behavior wrong? (No. She can eat fish if she wants to.)\nHow serious is the violation? (It\u0026rsquo;s not a violation.)\nIs it a sin? (No.)\u0026rdquo; … (p.44)\n5.4. Needless to say, the America children do not think like their Indian counterparts. They find that what the widow eats and how she dresses do not belong to the ethical domain. Neither do they find anything objectionable to the father being addressed by his first name. And, of course, they find it highly morally objectionable that the treatment in the hospital should be based on the wealth of the person.\n5.5. Well, we must be absolute cretins really. I mean, we seem to think that what the widow eats, what she wears, etc., are ethically more important than whether a poor man gets treated in a hospital or not. How did our culture ever manage to survive a couple of thousand years, when governed by such idiotic \u0026rsquo;norms\u0026rsquo;?\nAs though to rub salt in the wound, Shweder assures us that it is really not all that pathetic. In fact, he says, he could actually provide \u0026lsquo;reasoned defense of family life and social practice\u0026rsquo;, albeit in the form of an \u0026ldquo;ideal\u0026rdquo; argument structure. How does it look?\n\u0026ldquo;The body is a temple with a spirit dwelling in it. Therefore the sanctity of the temple must be preserved. Therefore impure things must be kept out of and away from the body.\u0026rdquo; (pp. 76-77.)\nGee, thanks. You had us worried there for a moment, you know: we really thought that we were a bunch of cretins.\nToo soon to feel relieved, I think. At least that is how it appears, if we follow Van Den Bossche and Mortier (1997), in their exposé of a Jain text. (The Vajjalaggam, VL for short.) Composed anywhere between 750 and 1337 CE, the author of this text is a Jain poet – a certain Jayavallabha by name. The text itself, Van Den Bossche and Mortier tell us, belongs to the Subhashita literature and thus could be called an \u0026rsquo;ethical text\u0026rsquo; and is a challenge of sorts: \u0026ldquo;One problem with the study of Indian ethics is that the ancient Indians themselves did not make a clear-cut distinction between the \u0026lsquo;moral\u0026rsquo; and other spheres. They did not have a word for our term \u0026rsquo;ethics\u0026rsquo; at all.\u0026rdquo; (p. 85).\nIt is important to note that Ancient Greek, for example, introduced not only the word \u0026rsquo;ethica\u0026rsquo;. The same culture also gave us many substantial treatises on that subject, the most well-known of which is Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s Ethica Nicomachea. If the Indian text, composed around 650- 1200 years ago, does not even have a word for that phenomenon called \u0026rsquo;ethics\u0026rsquo;, how could it be an ethical tract at all? It cannot. Hence the reason why the authors discover that the\n\u0026ldquo;text does not contain one single general rule stated in the prescriptive mode. General rule of conduct may easily be derived from various statements, but it is significant that the rules are not formulated as such. … The statements are written in the evaluative rather than the normative mode\u0026rdquo; (p.95).\nThat is to say, in this particular text there are no normative rules to be found. This cannot be construed as a deficiency of this text alone, because, as noted already, the Sanskrit language in which this text is written does not have a word even for the domain, namely, the ethical. Consequently, they study it \u0026lsquo;as a socio-ethical document\u0026rsquo;, which gives a \u0026ldquo;mosaic-like picture of feelings, attitudes and thoughts of different authors of ancient India.\u0026rdquo; (p. 87, my italics.)\nHow can one speak about \u0026lsquo;ancient\u0026rsquo; India, when one is talking about a text composed during the \u0026lsquo;middle ages\u0026rsquo;? Here, \u0026lsquo;antiquity\u0026rsquo; does not have a particular time-frame as its reference. Instead, it is civilizational: compared to the \u0026lsquo;ancient Greeks\u0026rsquo; (of about 2500 years ago), the Indian civilization of about 700 years ago is more \u0026lsquo;ancient\u0026rsquo; (i.e. more primitive). Of course, this is not made explicit but it is the only possible interpretation, especially in light of their conclusions.\n6.1. Here is their eloquent conclusion about the state of affairs:\n\u0026ldquo;Although VL exemplifies reflective ethical thinking, it contains no explicit propositions that argue for or against one type of virtue theory or another and it even sometimes lacks the terms necessary to formulate them. In this respect, the writings of the Greek and Roman virtue theorists are undoubtedly more reflective than what is found in the VL. Yet, this is a difference of degree, not of kind. The writings of the Greeks and the Romans in turn contain little reasoning about ethical language when compared to modern and contemporary moral philosophy.\u0026rdquo; (Pp.96-97)\n6.2. At the risk of emphasizing the obvious, some remarks are in order here. Firstly, even though VL embodies ethical thinking, it does not argue for any kind of ethical theory. In fact, it lacks the words necessary to conduct an ethical discussion. This absence of the terminology to talk about ethics differentiates the Indian traditions from the Greek culture. That is to say, there is a difference in kind between the Greek ethics and the Indian ethics: one had the words to talk about it, whereas the other does not. Secondly, this difference has some significance regarding the \u0026lsquo;reflective\u0026rsquo; thinking that VL is supposed to exemplify. How is it possible to reason and think about ethics, when you do not even have the words in which to do so? Obviously, you cannot. That is, there is a second kind of difference too, a consequence of the first: the Indian culture did not have the ability to reason and think about ethics. (That is why VL provides \u0026ldquo;a mosaic-like picture of feelings, attitudes and thoughts\u0026rdquo;.) Thirdly, if this is the difference that separates Indians from their Greek (or Roman) counterparts, even though coming after the Greeks by almost by a thousand years, the Indian thinkers are at the lower rung of the moral ladder: the Indians (of about a thousand years ago), followed by the Greeks (more than two thousand five hundred years ago), and then the contemporary moral philosophy. There is, however, a degree of difference between the Greeks and the contemporary moral philosophy: the latter is \u0026lsquo;more\u0026rsquo; reflective than the former. The Indians had little ideas about how to think about ethics and how to develop theories and arguments about them. How could they? Not only did the Indian culture not have the terms in which to think about ethics but their intellectuals did not also feel the need to create such terms (as late as the thirteenth or fourteenth century).\nThis is being written in 1997 in a journal on Asian Philosophy. Any further commentary, I take it, is superfluous.\nI can now be short, if not sweet. From the point of view of contemporary virtue ethics, we are basically intellectual imbeciles. In the hands of Van Den Bossche and Mortier, a Subhashita text becomes a \u0026lsquo;socio-ethical document\u0026rsquo; that belongs to \u0026lsquo;Ancient\u0026rsquo; India (even if it is composed after 750 CE). Shweder has no clue what \u0026lsquo;paap\u0026rsquo; is or about the practices that embed it, but simply transforms us into moral cretins. If, on the other hand, you are schooled in \u0026rsquo;normative ethics\u0026rsquo;, I challenge you not to call the Kamasutra immoral. Intellectually weak, morally moronic and, therefore, absolutely immoral. As we well know, these have been the Orientalist descriptions of India for the last couple of hundred years. However, they also appear as parts of our daily experience: whether of the caste system or of corruption. When the intellectuals pontificates or the intelligentsia moralizes, it is the voice that changes and not the message: we are cretins, imbeciles and immoral.\nReclaiming my Voice\nLet me now cease being the ventriloquist and speak in my own voice. The above three examples suggest what I mean by colonial experience. The criticism of the kind we read in Sulekha and elsewhere, whether on caste or on corruption, are moral in nature. Without exception, they make use of the western normative ethics for their moral criticisms. But to do so necessarily involves making factual claims about the absence of ethical thinking in the Indian traditions. One cannot escape this necessity by any kind of protest because the kind of necessity involved is logical in nature. Anyone who formulates moral criticisms of caste and corruption is logically compelled to deny the presence of \u0026lsquo;morality\u0026rsquo; in the Indian traditions.\nThis is what the British said about us. This is what we believe to be true. This is how we experience ourselves and our culture.\nLet me repeat what I said in my earlier column: colonialism is not merely a process of occupying lands and extracting revenues. It is not a question of encouraging us to ape the western countries in trying to be like them. It is not even about colonizing the imaginations of a people by making them dream that they too will become \u0026lsquo;modern\u0026rsquo;, developed and sophisticated. It goes deeper than any of these. It is about denying the colonized peoples and cultures their own experiences; of making them aliens to themselves; of actively preventing any description of their own experiences except in terms defined by the colonizers.\nThe European culture mapped on to itself aspects from the Indian culture so as to understand the latter. These mappings, in the form of explanations, have taken the status of frameworks to us. Liberalism, Marxism, secularism, etc. have become our mantras: we chant these without understanding them in the hope that if we do so long enough and sufficiently loud, the fruits will be ours to enjoy. However, in this process, we have assumed (without quite realizing what we are doing) that the European cultural experience is the \u0026lsquo;scientific\u0026rsquo; framework for us to understand our own culture. However, this very assumption prevents us from accessing our own culture and experience. We are busy denying our experiences while futilely busy trying to make alien experiences our own.\nThe Indian Renaissance\nToday, when we read about the lynching of five people in India, we need to ask ourselves what we see, what we experience and how we describe them. Do we see an injustice or even a paapa, or do we see \u0026rsquo;the caste system and its injustice\u0026rsquo;? Do we experience a \u0026lsquo;social injustice\u0026rsquo; when some person is not admitted to a temple? If it is, do we see the \u0026lsquo;same\u0026rsquo; when the same thing happens in a mosque or a synagogue? When we condemn a particular discrimination as \u0026lsquo;immoral\u0026rsquo; using the western ethical terminology, do we understand what it means? Or are we merely assuming we know? When a Pinky and Rajesh commit suicide near the railway tracks, what do we see or experience? And what do we say? Is there a tragedy involving \u0026lsquo;svavarna\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;Harijan\u0026rsquo;, or something analogous to what happened with Romeo and Juliet? Is what we see determined by what is said? Or do we simply not say what we see and not see what we say? It is in the process of answering these kinds of questions that we will pave the way for the Indian Renaissance.\nREFERENCES\nSee Almond (1988) for the historical contexts of this reconstruction and my 1994 for the more ambitious project of locating it within the context that the western culture is.\nhttp://www.creativecyberia.com/epinions/e-pinions2.htm.

It is a structure or style of thinking about ethics. What is its structure? It makes use of norms. What are norms? \u0026lsquo;Rules\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;principles\u0026rsquo; which have a characteristic structure that use certain concepts like the moral \u0026lsquo;ought\u0026rsquo; and moral \u0026lsquo;ought not\u0026rsquo;. That is, some actions ought to be performed (i.e. they are obligatory); some actions ought not to be performed (i.e. they are forbidden) and some actions are neither of the two (i.e. they are permitted). What is important to note is that these norms (i.e. for example, some action is obligatory) hold irrespective of time, place, condition or the person. In other words, norms are supposed to hold universally. From what I have said above, it logically follows that violation (or transgressing) some moral norm or the other is immoral (or unethical) and following some moral norm is moral (or ethical).\nOne of the important consequences of §1 is that all norms are universal in scope: that is, it is linguistically and logically impossible to have a particular norm or a context-dependent norm. Let me just illustrate with an example. Let us consider the norm that \u0026ldquo;Balu ought to reply to the posts here\u0026rdquo;. This appears as a particular (or context-dependent) norm. As soon as we ask \u0026lsquo;why\u0026rsquo; we see that the chain of arguments leads us very quickly to a universal norm from which this particular norm is derived. Because \u0026ldquo;authors ought to reply to their readers, where it is possible to do so\u0026rdquo; or some such thing. (I have skipped the scenario because constructing any such scenario is easy.) This norm applies to all authors (in a position to reply to their readers) independent of their place, time, country or culture. This is what is meant by the universal nature of the norms. The particular norm is justified only because of the universal norm. If and only if the universal norm is justifiable is its derivation also justifiable.\nWhen I speak of western \u0026rsquo;normative\u0026rsquo; ethics, this is all I have in mind. In one sense, the confusion in the discussion is indicative of our lack of understanding: most of us do not understand this type of ethics. (We do not, that is, have the foggiest of what we are talking about, when we indulge in normative discussions.) At the same time, because the above ideas sound and look very familiar we think we know what we are talking about and, in fact, will go to absurd lengths to show that we know what we are talking about! An ignorance of the issue coupled to the conviction of knowledge of the same issue is the trajectory of discussions with Indians on ethics. It is extremely difficult to make them understand what \u0026rsquo;norms\u0026rsquo; are; it is equally difficult to make them understand what \u0026rsquo;norms\u0026rsquo; are not. (I shall shortly say why.) Let me begin by rephrasing what I have said in my earlier posts.\nAccording to §1, a municipal office or a building contractor is immoral because they violate a moral norm. (\u0026lsquo;One shall not take bribes\u0026rsquo; or whatever else takes your fancy.) According to western normative ethics, one can be immoral, if and only if one violates some or another moral principle. Otherwise, not.\nNot only is the phenomenon that we call \u0026ldquo;corruption\u0026rdquo; in India immoral but so is the caste system: the latter, because, let us say, it violates the norm that all human beings ought to be treated equal. Therefore, it is simple to condemn both corruption and the caste system as immoral because their existence and practice violate some or another moral norm.\nIf you are with me so far (despite the drastically simplified presentation), I can now answer the following question: \u0026ldquo;where is the colonial awareness in accepting this ethics?\u0026rdquo; Let me begin with the following claims: this mode of ethical reasoning is absent in our culture. Even worse (or better!), we cannot formulate norms in the Indian (not just Indian, but let me leave that aside) languages! And further, we cannot even understand the western ethics because we are mapping this onto our Indian (non-normative) ethics. Do not expect me to argue for the truth of any of these claims: they will get taken care of (to some extent) in my book. Even one book is not sufficient to do this.\n6.1. Let me begin with an example and an anecdote. The example first. In Indian languages, I claim, there is no equivalent of the \u0026ldquo;moral ought\u0026rdquo;. That is, we cannot say one \u0026ldquo;ought not\u0026rdquo; kill, one \u0026ldquo;ought to\u0026rdquo; respect their parents, the way one can do these in the European languages. In our languages, these sentences have the same structure as \u0026ldquo;one should not stand up and drink water\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;you should come home today\u0026rdquo; and such like. How can we know whether the \u0026ldquo;should\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;should not\u0026rdquo; (or \u0026ldquo;must\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;must not\u0026rdquo;) do not have the same logical and semantic properties in our languages that the moral \u0026ldquo;ought\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;ought not\u0026rdquo; have in the European languages? Simple. There exist systems of Deontic Logics (anyone with some understanding of the mathematical model theory can follow them) that very precisely delineate the property and behavior of the moral concepts like \u0026lsquo;forbidden\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;obligatory\u0026rsquo;. That is, we can show that the Indian equivalents do not exhibit this logical and semantic behavior.\n6.2. One of the reasons that cultures like India were called \u0026lsquo;immoral\u0026rsquo; by the Western thinkers lies here: there is nothing resembling a universal moral norm in our traditions. In the lens of the western culture, it appeared (logically) that all actions are permitted within the Indian culture. Hence the appellation \u0026lsquo;immoral\u0026rsquo;. This is also the reason why people like Shweder and others transform us into moral imbeciles. (We have not even learnt to formulate the moral norms.)\n6.3. However, this does not mean (that is where I would like to go) that the Indian cultures are immoral (or that we are moral imbeciles). I would like to show that non-normative ethics exist (i.e. ethics that works without using or needing norms to make ethical judgments) and that India is one such culture.\n6.4. Let me take, as an example, one of the many frustrating discussions I have had with Indians on this subject. All of them have taken objection to my claim in §6.1 and want to \u0026lsquo;show\u0026rsquo; that we too have the moral ought. In one such discussion in JNU, here is how one person tried to refute me: \u0026ldquo;the Hindi word \u0026rsquo;tha\u0026rsquo; is the moral ought in Hindi.\u0026rdquo; (He had, most probably, a sentence like \u0026ldquo;Aapko aiyse nahin karna tha”\u0026rdquo; in mind.) I drew his attention to the fact that \u0026rsquo;tha\u0026rsquo; was the past tense for \u0026lsquo;hai\u0026rsquo; and that it was not the equivalent of \u0026ldquo;moral ought\u0026rdquo; at all.\n6.5. Why did he think that this was a counter-example? He confused the ethical force in the above sentence with the structure of the sentence. He thought that I was denying that Indians had ethics, because, he felt, denying a normative language is to deny the possibility of doing ethics in the Indian languages. He was convinced, and probably still is, that he understands what western ethics is because he does ethics in his native language; because he learnt an English language through the medium of his own native language, he has understood the meaning of moral vocabulary in the English language.\n6.6. Most (if not all) Indian readers are in this boat. They think they know what moral language in English means because they think they can use it. Actually, they do not understand it: they are talking \u0026lsquo;Indian\u0026rsquo; while trying to be an \u0026lsquo;angreji\u0026rsquo;.\nWe have a colonial experience not only when we think that deva\u0026rsquo;s are \u0026lsquo;gods\u0026rsquo;, puja is \u0026lsquo;worship\u0026rsquo; etc. We exhibit exactly the same experience when we say that \u0026ldquo;corruption is rampant in India\u0026rdquo; or that \u0026ldquo;the caste system is immoral\u0026rdquo;. Each and every time we \u0026lsquo;criticise\u0026rsquo; the immorality of the Indians, we exhibit this colonization. The tragedy is that we genuinely believe that we are modern, progressive, and reform-minded when we do these things. My hope in writing this article was to force an induced break in this experience. Would this all-too-brief-an-explanation, together with the article bring this about? I await your verdict. Only one request: please, please think about these issues and the article seriously.

Lingam is how Shiva\u0026rsquo;s puja is done (as against, say, how we do puja to Vishnu) by the Indians. You tell me that this factual claim is wrong and that by saying what I have just said, I project my present to \u0026rsquo;explain\u0026rsquo; the past. Very well.\nIn the first place, I want to draw your attention to the issue that I am not providing any interpretation, whereas you are. You are the one who tells me that I doing something other than doing puja to Shiva, viz., I am doing puja to a \u0026lsquo;symbol\u0026rsquo; that, in its turn, belongs to a fertility cult. Therefore, I am justified in asking you why you think so. Why did our ancestors take to doing puja to a symbol instead of saying straightaway that they do puja to the penis, irrespective of whose penis it is? It could not be because they were \u0026lsquo;prudish\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;repressed\u0026rsquo;. If women did move about bare-breasted then, and we gave the world the \u0026lsquo;Kama Sutra\u0026rsquo;, surely they would not have been inhibited in saying that they worshipped penis? Why did they have to \u0026lsquo;invent\u0026rsquo; a symbolism for the penis, deny that it was merely a penis and cook up the utterly fantastic story that it was the Shiva linga? If the modern day Indians were to cook this story up, one could understand it within your framework. Yet you say, most Indians do not even know they are worshipping a symbol, whereas our ancestors did. Well, you need to make this plausible to me and to the others: why ever did our ancestors take to \u0026lsquo;symbolisms\u0026rsquo;, cook up fantastic camouflaging stories that hide the \u0026rsquo;true\u0026rsquo; meaning, instead of simply saying what I say? Why this devious route and not a direct insistence that one worships penis irrespective of its form or size?\nUntil you come with a satisfying story that explains the \u0026lsquo;deviousness\u0026rsquo; of our ancestors, I think I am justified in saying this: we do what our ancestors did too, i.e. do puja to Shiva in the form of the lingam. Because this simple story does not satisfy you and you need the complicated talk of fertility cults and symbolisms, I am justified in my skepticism until that stage when you come up with a satisfactory story. At this moment, no one has; I do not believe you will either. But I am and remain open. (You will, of course, understand that I am adopting a scientific and rational attitude here: when two explanations of the \u0026lsquo;same\u0026rsquo; phenomenon exist, one chooses the simpler to the more complicated.

There are many reasons for it: the political, the social, the economic as well as cultural. In fact, I think that this is not merely an Indian phenomenon but an Asian one.

That those to whom such accounts make sense do not explicitly subscribe to the premises of a specific religious appears to throw doubt on our claims.\nConsider the very distinction between \u0026rsquo;the religious\u0026rsquo; and \u0026rsquo;the secular\u0026rsquo;. Historically, Christianity has drawn this line. (Theologians have spent much ink over the last two thousand years drawing, defending, and elaborating upon this distinction.) It is also the case that political thinkers in the West, some of whom were militantly atheistic, have made this distinction into a cornerstone of their theories. Further, many Indian thinkers, most of whom know very little of Christian theologies, base their arguments on these and allied distinctions. The existence of the last two groups appears to tell us that even when one rejects some or all religions, even when one is utterly oblivious to the histories and theologies of the Christianities, this distinction does make sense.\nThere are two possible explanations for this state of affairs. (One could come up with many more but, for the sake of clarity, I will focus upon the two opposing extremes.) One is to argue that for this distinction to make sense no particular background political theory (or any particular set of theologies) is required. Such a distinction, in that case, is a neutral distinction: it is neutral with respect to theologies and political theories. Of course, no distinction like the above, strictly speaking, is neutral. It is rooted in some or another theory, in some or another set of assumptions. (This is the insight we have due to the unflagging labors of the historians and philosophers of sciences and languages.) This claim is familiar to most students of religion.\nSuppose that there exists a theory, which argues the following: the distinction between \u0026rsquo;the secular\u0026rsquo; and \u0026rsquo;the religious\u0026rsquo; is drawn within a religion, by a religion and that it is a religious distinction. What is called \u0026rsquo;the secular\u0026rsquo; is religion secularized or is religion in a different set of clothes. That is, it suggests that religions spread in two ways: through the process of conversion and the through the process of winning adherents to its doctrines but by formulating the latter in a \u0026rsquo;neutral\u0026rsquo; way. Consequently, this theory suggests that the process of conversion and the process of secularization are two faces of the same coin: the spread of a religion. In such a case, the unfamiliarity of people with some or another set of identifiable theological doctrines is not an argument against the claim that these distinctions are theological or religious in nature. The acceptance of theological or religious claims by people who are atheistic and ignorant of religious niceties, in such case, indexes the extent to which a religion has spread in society.\nI have built the barebones of such a theory and such an argument. Consequently, if one wants to challenge this, one has to come up with an alternate theory of religion, which does all the work my theory does and something more besides. (Again, this is an insight from the philosophies of the sciences.) A mere reference to the fact that atheistic people or people ignorant of religious matters accept the distinction between \u0026rsquo;the secular\u0026rsquo; and \u0026rsquo;the religious\u0026rsquo; is neither evidence nor a relevant argument.

His main argument is that Hinduism isn\u0026rsquo;t an invention by anyone in particular. It grew out of a need to establish an identity vis-à-vis foreigners (mlecchas). In other words, an identity by contrast with the \u0026lsquo;others.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;\nThere is a world of difference between what one wants to argue and what one, in fact, argues. The above (accurate) summary literally begs all the questions the article intends to solve.\nThe assumption is that the \u0026lsquo;self\u0026rsquo; builds its identity by contrasting itself with the \u0026lsquo;other\u0026rsquo;. There are four possible sources for this assumption. 1a. This is \u0026lsquo;our\u0026rsquo; (whose?) commonsense. Of course, just because some people believe this claim to be true does not make it true. Not long ago, it was a part of the commonsense that Earth was flat.\n1b. This is a theory in individual psychology. Even if we assume that this is true of individuals, its extension to a people (or a collective) requires empirical proof. It is not possible to argue for its truth on logical grounds. Such a move commits the fallacy of composition: from the claim that none of my bodily parts weighs more than 10 kilos, I cannot argue that my body, as a whole, does not weigh more than 10 kilos.\n1c. This is a theory in social psychology. It is not. As of 2004, we do not have any theory in social psychology that tells us how all human groups build a social identity for themselves.\n1d. It is a philosophical claim. It indeed is. Unfortunately, this is a claim advanced by certain strains in Western philosophy. It is unfortunate not because it is Western, but because the \u0026lsquo;self-other\u0026rsquo; dialectic is not the only way to build the identity of the self. Contrasting itself with the other is one way of building an identity for the self. There are other ways, where the \u0026lsquo;self\u0026rsquo; does not even enter the picture. To the readers on this list, the so-called mahavakyas are very familiar: \u0026ldquo;Tat tvam asi\u0026rdquo;, thou art that, i.e., the \u0026lsquo;self\u0026rsquo; is the other of the other. That is to say, there is the other, and everything else (including the \u0026lsquo;self\u0026rsquo;) is the other of the other. The \u0026lsquo;self\u0026rsquo; is undefined, whereas both the \u0026lsquo;other\u0026rsquo; and the \u0026lsquo;other to the other\u0026rsquo; are defined. In other words, the \u0026lsquo;other\u0026rsquo; and the \u0026lsquo;other to the other\u0026rsquo; dialectic replace the \u0026lsquo;self\u0026rsquo; and the \u0026lsquo;other\u0026rsquo; dialectic.\nLorenzen\u0026rsquo;s claim requires proof of its truth. He has not provided it.\nEven if the Indians wanted to build an identity for themselves by contrasting themselves with the \u0026lsquo;mlechhas\u0026rsquo;, it is not at all obvious why they would do so by calling Hinduism a religion. In fact, it is much more plausible for them to say that Christians and Muslims are different \u0026lsquo;jatis\u0026rsquo;. (Anyone with any degree of familiarity with India would know why such would be the case.) No Indian ever considered \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; a jati. So, we need more compelling proof and argument than Lorenzen has provided to believe that the Indians, by contrasting themselves with Muslims and Christians, \u0026lsquo;invented\u0026rsquo; Hinduism as a religion.\nEven worse, it is not at all obvious what Lorenzen is trying to \u0026lsquo;disprove\u0026rsquo;. The import, meaning and the reference of his title is very unclear. What is he asking? Who invented the word \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo;? Who invented Hinduism as a label? Who invented Hinduism as a name for a set of phenomena? Who invented the phenomenon of Hinduism? Who invented Hinduism as a religion? Who invented the \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo; that Hinduism is? The questions are endless. His article does not even distinguish between these questions.

Even this question is wrongly posed. I am not claiming that there is some \u0026lsquo;authentic\u0026rsquo; Indian culture, which lives somewhere or lived some when in India. Such a culture, even if it exists or existed, does not concern me. I am interested in the Indian culture as it exists today: including the aftermath of the Islamic and the British colonization. I am child of this culture, and this is the one I am trying to understand. The Indian \u0026lsquo;Diaspora\u0026rsquo; in the US is as much Indian as some peasant living somewhere in a far-off village in India; they both belong to the Indian culture. Neither this peasant nor the Indians in the US is \u0026lsquo;more Indian\u0026rsquo; than the other. My problem is not: who is the \u0026lsquo;authentic\u0026rsquo; Indian or what is the \u0026lsquo;authentic\u0026rsquo; Indian culture? My question is about the 21st century India, and its present culture, which has absorbed many things, adapted many things from other cultures in many different ways. It is this set of Indian traditions that interests me. Was I \u0026lsquo;westernized\u0026rsquo; by the time I was a teenager? Who knows, or even who cares? What would it mean to say that I was \u0026lsquo;authentically\u0026rsquo; Indian or that I was \u0026lsquo;quasi-westernized\u0026rsquo;? Surely, the issue is not about some kind of \u0026lsquo;purity\u0026rsquo; here. What else is it? Consequently, when I speak of my past, I speak of the past of those who were brought up like me. If we were all partly \u0026lsquo;westernized\u0026rsquo;, then the culture I am talking about is this \u0026lsquo;partly westernized\u0026rsquo; Indian culture. An age long gone by, if it ever existed, does not give me sleepless nights; what does is what is happening now. Thus, when I say I want to understand Indian culture, I am not harking back to some \u0026lsquo;golden age\u0026rsquo;, my friend, but India as I know it today. To understand this India, I need to understand how her traditions are lived today, not what they perhaps meant one thousand years ago.\n","tags":[],"title":"Criticism: you are ‘Westernized’!","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/criticism-you-are-westernized/"},{"categories":["Edward Said","essentialism","orientalism","explication"],"content":"I have had difficulties in understanding the use and meaning of some words, especially \u0026rsquo;essentialism\u0026rsquo; and its cognates. Here are some uses of \u0026ldquo;essentialism\u0026rdquo; I am familiar with.\nOne uses \u0026rsquo;essences\u0026rsquo; to designate some basic or fundamental or determining properties of an object, as in: \u0026ldquo;Water is essentially H2O\u0026rdquo;. Here the claim is that some liquid is water if and only if it has the chemical structure of containing two molecules of Hydrogen and one molecule of Oxygen for every single molecule of the liquid in question. One uses \u0026rsquo;essences\u0026rsquo; in order to understand counterfactual sentences involving proper nouns, as in: \u0026ldquo;If I were George Bush, I would not have gone to war with Iraq\u0026rdquo;. This sentence is a counterfactual because it begins by assuming a non-fact (I am Balu and not George Bush); picks out a state of affairs where this is true (a possible world where \u0026lsquo;Balu\u0026rsquo; IS \u0026lsquo;George Bush\u0026rsquo;) and makes a (true or false) statement about this (I might or might not have gone to war with Iraq). Many historical claims (and many scientific laws) have the form of counterfactual statements. Here \u0026rsquo;essence\u0026rsquo; is predicated to Balu (something like \u0026ldquo;baluhood\u0026rdquo;) so that Balu remains Balu even if he were to become \u0026lsquo;George Bush\u0026rsquo; in some possible world. One uses \u0026rsquo;essences\u0026rsquo; to solve the problem of providing references to proper names, as in \u0026ldquo;Socrates was not a teacher of Plato\u0026rdquo;. In many cases, we identify Socrates as that person who has the property of \u0026lsquo;being a teacher of Plato\u0026rsquo;. If it transpires that such is not the case, we will still not be in doubt about the identity of Socrates because, much like the previous case, it speaks about some \u0026rsquo;essential property\u0026rsquo; of Socrates by virtue of which he remains the same person even when he does not have some or another accidental or contingent property. One uses \u0026rsquo;essences\u0026rsquo; while solving the puzzle of identity, as in \u0026ldquo;This is me, a photograph taken when I was three years old\u0026rdquo;. Here, \u0026lsquo;me, when I was three years old\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;me in America during the 1990 AAR conference\u0026rsquo; etc. become spatio-temporal slices of an \u0026lsquo;I\u0026rsquo;. The \u0026lsquo;I\u0026rsquo; has indefinitely many spatio-temporal slices and these are all slices of one and the same \u0026lsquo;I\u0026rsquo;. The idea is that one does not become someone else other than who one is because of the spatio-temporal career of \u0026lsquo;oneself\u0026rsquo;. Even though there are many discussions about each of these uses, there is nothing wrong or illegitimate about using the word \u0026rsquo;essence\u0026rsquo; or indeed to \u0026ldquo;talk in an essentializing way\u0026rdquo;. Quite obviously, the \u0026lsquo;subaltern\u0026rsquo; historiographers could not mean \u0026rsquo;essentialism\u0026rsquo; in any of the above senses, because they suggest that essentialism is something to avoid. I know of one such use of the word in Said\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Orientalism\u0026rdquo;, where he suggests that to correlate climatic conditions with the psychology or culture of a people (something that often happened in the eighteenth nineteenth centuries) is to commit the sin of essentialism. Clearly, this is not the kind of essentialism that is at issue here.\nSo, when someone says that \u0026lsquo;one should not treat religion in an essentializing way\u0026rsquo; or that \u0026ldquo;religion … need not be essentializing\u0026rdquo; or wants to \u0026ldquo;account for religion in a nonessentializing way\u0026rdquo; and so on, I am totally lost. Could someone please explain what \u0026ldquo;essentialism\u0026rdquo; is and why it is wrong to speak of \u0026ldquo;essences\u0026rdquo;? In the absence of some such exposé and defence (neither of which is present in the subaltern studies), I am afraid, all this talk of \u0026rsquo;essentialism\u0026rsquo; would become jargon and humbug, and merely a stick to beat the others with.\nEssentialism is a philosophical theory about the furniture of the world. In so far as one uses \u0026rsquo;essentialism\u0026rsquo; as a term, one uses it the way it is embedded in some theory or another. To rip it out of its contexts, give it arbitrary meanings, and use it as a \u0026lsquo;catch-all\u0026rsquo; term is intellectually unacceptable. Surely, that is the problem with the post-colonial and subaltern writers. Not one of them has ever identified the philosophical theory of essentialism they disagree with; most do not appear to know whether \u0026rsquo;nominalism\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;realism\u0026rsquo;, or \u0026lsquo;constructivism\u0026rsquo; forms its contrast set. It is not even clear whether the \u0026rsquo;essentialism\u0026rsquo; they oppose has to do with language or the world. A statement that is trivially true when taken to be about the world is semantic nonsense, if used as a claim about language use. Consider the following example: \u0026ldquo;There exists no religion but only many religions\u0026rdquo;. (I am sure we can think of many such examples.) If the claim is about the world, then it is trivially true: no scholar has ever claimed that there is an entity in the world called \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo; that exists alongside such phenomena as Christianity, Islam, Judaism and so on. However, this statement becomes semantic nonsense if one suggests that the use of the \u0026lsquo;category\u0026rsquo; of religion, therefore, is \u0026rsquo;essentialistic\u0026rsquo;. If Christianity, Judaism, Islam etc. are \u0026lsquo;religions\u0026rsquo;, they are that is only because they \u0026lsquo;belong\u0026rsquo; to the category of religion. (In simpler terms, each of them belongs to the set \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo;.) The same consideration applies to the \u0026lsquo;plural forms\u0026rsquo; of these religions. One hears it often said that there is no \u0026lsquo;Christianity\u0026rsquo; but only \u0026lsquo;Christianities\u0026rsquo; or that there is no \u0026lsquo;Islam\u0026rsquo; but only \u0026lsquo;Islams\u0026rsquo; and such like. While trivially true, one does not seem to realize that this is possible only because of the set \u0026lsquo;Christianity\u0026rsquo; and the set \u0026lsquo;Islam\u0026rsquo;. Consider the opposite case where theses about language are confused with theses about the world. No intellectual worthy of his/her name (this applies even to the extreme forms of \u0026lsquo;idealism\u0026rsquo; of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries) has ever claimed that \u0026lsquo;meanings\u0026rsquo; are not socially constructed. I mean to say, no one has ever suggested that human languages are not human constructs or that the meanings of the words in these languages are not socially constructed. No biologist has ever identified a gene in us that provides us with the meaning of the English word, say, \u0026rsquo;essentialism\u0026rsquo;, nor do the biologists waste their time in pursuing such silly tasks. From this, of course, it does not follow that the world is a human construct or that the existence of things in the world are dependent on their \u0026lsquo;meanings\u0026rsquo; for us human beings. Such a thesis is trivially false. Spivak\u0026rsquo;s \u0026lsquo;strategic essentialism\u0026rsquo; is an excellent illustration of how not to talk about things you do not understand. Even a vague familiarity with the history of philosophy teaches one that there could be a \u0026lsquo;strategic\u0026rsquo; or \u0026rsquo;tactical\u0026rsquo; use of some or another theory of essentialism without subscribing to that ontology. In fact, \u0026lsquo;instrumentalism\u0026rsquo; (a philosophical school that claims that scientific concepts do not refer but they are merely useful devices in prediction and control) has a celebrated career in the history of philosophy. By speaking about \u0026lsquo;strategic essentialism\u0026rsquo; as some kind of a philosophical theory that Guha \u0026lsquo;invents\u0026rsquo; (?), Spivak is not even reinventing the wheel; she merely wants us to discard it altogether without telling us why except hinting that it is a \u0026lsquo;sin\u0026rsquo;. What is the essentialism that the subaltern historiographers and postcolonial writers oppose? What is wrong with that variety of essentialism?\nFor more on illiterate criticisms like essentialism, etc, check Balagangadhara\u0026rsquo;s Reconceptualizing India Studies, published by OUP, India and this paper.\n","tags":[],"title":"Vacuity of Essentialism?—S.N.Balagangadhara","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/vacuity-of-essentialism-s-n-balagangadhara/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","Nietzsche","puja","translation","worship"],"content":"X says: if \u0026ldquo;pujya\u0026rdquo; means \u0026ldquo;worthy of worship\u0026rdquo;, wouldn\u0026rsquo;t \u0026ldquo;puja\u0026rdquo; mean worship?\n\u0026lsquo;Pujya\u0026rsquo; means \u0026ldquo;deserving of \u0026lsquo;puja\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;.

Let me give you an example, which should give you a sense of the nature of the problem.\nNietzsche, the philosopher not exactly known for his Christian sympathies, referring to Sir John Lubbock – an English historian from the 19th century – writes (Human, All too Human, #3, §111) about the \u0026lsquo;Origin of the Religious Cult\u0026rsquo; thus:\n\u0026ldquo;In India (according to Lubbock) a carpenter is accustomed to make sacrifices to his hammer, his axe and other tools; a Brahman treats the crayon with which he writes, a soldier the weapon he employs in the field, a mason his trowel, a laborer his plough in the same way.\u0026rdquo;\nOne presumes that Lubbock is talking about \u0026lsquo;Ayudha Puja\u0026rsquo; here. I have claimed that the word \u0026lsquo;worship\u0026rsquo; is theological. Why?\nBecause, amongst other things, what \u0026lsquo;worship\u0026rsquo; is, how and what one \u0026lsquo;worships\u0026rsquo;, and in what forms one \u0026lsquo;worships\u0026rsquo; etc. etc. cannot be the \u0026ldquo;invention of busy human minds\u0026rdquo; – as one of the early Church Fathers put it in his battle against the Pagans in Rome – but one requiring revelation.\nOne can only worship \u0026lsquo;God\u0026rsquo;. If you belong to one of the Abrahamic religions, you know who that \u0026lsquo;God\u0026rsquo; is: He is the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. Any other \u0026lsquo;worship\u0026rsquo; is worshipping the \u0026lsquo;false God\u0026rsquo;. And the true \u0026lsquo;God\u0026rsquo;, you know this as well, is \u0026lsquo;The Lord, The Master of the Universe, The Creator\u0026rsquo;, and so on.\nThe meaning of \u0026lsquo;worship\u0026rsquo;, in English because we are talking about the use and meaning of the word from this language, is wholly indebted to the above theological explications given to it.\nIf \u0026lsquo;puja\u0026rsquo; is worship, and the Indians do \u0026lsquo;Aayudha Puja\u0026rsquo; (which they do), you have only two possible (and please, do not bring in \u0026lsquo;symbolic\u0026rsquo; worship into the discussion!) explanations: (a) they are worshipping the Devil and his minions; Or (b) they are absolute and total cretins.\nWhy the latter option as well? If an Indian does \u0026lsquo;puja\u0026rsquo; to his bicycle on the \u0026lsquo;Aayudha Puja\u0026rsquo; day, are we to attribute to him the belief that he thinks that his bicycle is \u0026lsquo;The Lord, The Master of the Universe, The Creator\u0026rsquo;? If he does, then he is an absolute idiot. If he does not, what exactly does he do when he does \u0026lsquo;puja\u0026rsquo;?\nI have problems with descriptions that transform entire continents and peoples (over thousands of years) into idiots and cretins. Well, the translation of \u0026lsquo;puja\u0026rsquo; as \u0026lsquo;worship\u0026rsquo; (and not just that one word alone, obviously) does precisely that. There is no way, on \u0026lsquo;heaven\u0026rsquo; or on earth, that cultures could survive for thousands of years comprising only of those suffering from Down\u0026rsquo;s Syndrome. From this it follows that the translation of \u0026lsquo;puja\u0026rsquo; as \u0026lsquo;worship\u0026rsquo; is totally wrong, unless, of course, one does accept that the Indian (in fact, all non-Christian, non-Judaic, non-Muslim peoples) indeed worship the devil.\nI do not know about you, but I find it preposterous even to entertain either of the alternatives.

Rabbinic Judaism was less interested in building a demonology than others. It is one thing to say this, but quite another to say that the Judaic tradition knows of the Devil only in terms of the psychological \u0026lsquo;inclinations\u0026rsquo; in man. (It is equivalent to suggesting that there is no demonology in Judaic thought, a preposterous suggestion on any count.) Belial, Mastema, Azazel, Satanail, Sammael, Semyzza, or Satan do not name either psychological or spiritual \u0026lsquo;inclinations\u0026rsquo;, surely. (Think further of what Behemoth, Leviathan, etc. are). The Satan in the Book of Job is already an emissary of God (though not yet the personification of evil), and not a mere \u0026lsquo;inclination\u0026rsquo;. The Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs name Belial or Satan as Chief of evil angels commanding the spirits of wrath, hatred, etc. and as lord of war, fornication, bloodshed, destruction, etc. He tempts and seduces humankind to error.\nBy saying this, I do not suggest that the \u0026lsquo;Devil\u0026rsquo; made his appearance in the Judaic literature in one fell swoop, equipped with horns, tail, hoof, and a fork. (It took time, suffering, exile, and such like before the notion of \u0026lsquo;Devil\u0026rsquo; finally crystallized.) But I do want to maintain that appear he did, and has remained there ever since.\nThe most modern-day Roman Catholics have difficulties in consigning a Buddha or a Confucius to Hell and call them minions of the Devil. This is true. My point is not about the sensibilities of any particular group in today\u0026rsquo;s world but about a structure of thought, which still has an enormous impact on these sensibilities as well.\nTo get a flavor of this impact, consider the notion of\u0026rsquo; \u0026lsquo;polytheism\u0026rsquo;. (For the moment, let us keep etymologies of theos and such like outside the purview of our discussion.) In both commonsense and scholarly parlance it is supposed to connote multiplicity of \u0026lsquo;gods\u0026rsquo;, which contrasted to \u0026lsquo;monotheism\u0026rsquo; that is alleged to connote a single entity \u0026lsquo;God\u0026rsquo;. (Look at the way the words are capitalized as well.) Ask yourself this simple question: who or what can the word \u0026lsquo;god\u0026rsquo; refers to? Within the (simplified) framework sketched in my earlier post, this notion makes perfect theological sense. The plurality of \u0026lsquo;gods\u0026rsquo; can only refer to entities other than \u0026lsquo;God\u0026rsquo;: the \u0026lsquo;false\u0026rsquo; gods and the True one. If you take away this theological framework, the notion of \u0026lsquo;polytheism\u0026rsquo; is strictly senseless and becomes a contradiction-in-terms: If \u0026lsquo;god\u0026rsquo; is that being which created the world, the Lord of the Universe (say), how can there be a plurality of such entities? If such a multiplicity exists, none of them is \u0026lsquo;god\u0026rsquo;. If none is \u0026lsquo;god\u0026rsquo; there can be no multiplicity of gods either. Therefore, polytheism is possible if and only if polytheism is impossible.\nHere is why this arcane discussion becomes relevant to us. How many of us have not been taught (and still teach) that \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; is a polytheistic religion? To the European Christians, and their liberal \u0026lsquo;secular\u0026rsquo; counterparts, who continue write books and treatises about \u0026lsquo;Hindu Polytheism\u0026rsquo;, such appellations make perfect sense. They have not really left their theological framework behind. But to us, people from another culture, this should not make sense. In fact, I suggest it does not. But we continue to act as though the notion of \u0026lsquo;polytheism\u0026rsquo; makes linguistic sense (when it is perfect semantic nonsense). Why do we do this?\nPartly, but only partly, because that is how we have learnt English: we were taught that \u0026lsquo;deva\u0026rsquo; was \u0026lsquo;god\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;puja\u0026rsquo; is \u0026lsquo;worship\u0026rsquo; and so on. Who coined these terms? Well, people with a theologically inspired framework. To them, \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;Buddhism\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;Jainism\u0026rsquo; were not only religions but also pagan or heathen religions, whose practitioners worshipped the Devil and his minions.\nConsider some questions, which ask the \u0026lsquo;Hindus\u0026rsquo; whether they \u0026lsquo;worship\u0026rsquo; lingam, stones, monkeys, rats, and such like. It is important to realize that \u0026lsquo;worship\u0026rsquo; is a theological concept\u0026ndash;nothing like our notion of \u0026lsquo;puja\u0026rsquo;. You can worship only \u0026lsquo;God\u0026rsquo;\u0026ndash; in exactly the same sense in which you can only eat what is food to you. It is possible that you worship the false god (an image is how this false god deceives you into worshipping him), while under the impression you worship \u0026lsquo;God\u0026rsquo;. This \u0026lsquo;God\u0026rsquo; is not any Tom, Dick, or Harry, but \u0026lsquo;The Perfect Being, The Creator, The Lord of the Universe\u0026rsquo;. Again, ask yourself this simple question: which idiot ever thought that some particular rat, or cow, or crow, or \u0026rsquo;lingam\u0026rsquo; is \u0026lsquo;The Perfect Being, The Creator, The Lord of the Universe\u0026rsquo;? Idiots exist everywhere, but should whole cultures and peoples (from Asia to Africa) comprise only of idiots, such a group could never survive. Whatever the future might bring, India is a culture and has survived for a couple of thousand years. Are we to assume that Indians do not know they have physiological fathers and mothers, and they were all brought into being by a crow, a rat, or a \u0026rsquo;lingam\u0026rsquo; made out of stone?\nIn other words, we really need to re-think what we have been taught about who we are and what we do. Our question (in this context and as an example) should not be what puja means, or how it should be translated into English, but what is it we Indians do, when we do Puja.\nThis applies not merely to the endless diatribes about \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;Buddhism\u0026rsquo;, but to many more things, things that we have imbibed along with our mother\u0026rsquo;s milk. A long, arduous job, but worth every inch of the way. It appears to me that those of us, who are living elsewhere, in another culture and at other times than our forefathers, can at least attempt to undertake the job of critically reflecting on our own experiences instead of reproducing barren third-rate ideas borrowed from second-hand sources from elsewhere.\nl:unet2\n","tags":[],"title":"God, Devil (Satan), and Polytheism","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/god-devilsatan-and-polytheism-s-n-balagangadhara/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","puja"],"content":"Let me begin by Mujeeb\u0026rsquo;s objection to calling the Islamic people \u0026lsquo;Mohammedans\u0026rsquo;. Mujib\u0026rsquo;s objection was that the Muslims do not worship Mohammed, and Naseem spoke of it as an insulting appellation. They are right, of course, but they did not appear to get the authentic problem posed by a Raghavan and a Seshadri: surely \u0026lsquo;Mohammedans\u0026rsquo; are those who follow the doctrines (or teachings) of Mohammed. Marxists, Buddhists, and even Christians were called in to bolster the applicability of such a language-use. Despite the acrimonious sphere among the participants, there is a very, very deep reason why neither understands the other\u0026rsquo;s question.\nThe following sets of ideas\u0026ndash;common to the Abrahamic Religions, viz., the Judaic religion, Christianity and Islam\u0026ndash;are crucial. (a) There is only one God; but (b) there is also the False God, viz., the Devil. (c) Human beings, on their own, aided only by human reason, will never discover the \u0026rsquo;true God\u0026rsquo;. (d) That is because the False God seduces mankind into worshipping him. The devil is not just the prince of darkness but also the ruler of earth and following him and his minions (whose numbers are legion) will lead you to eternal damnation. (e) you can only know \u0026rsquo;true God\u0026rsquo; and how to worship Him, only when He reveals Himself and tells you this.\nAs a consequence, the \u0026rsquo;teachings\u0026rsquo; of, say Mohammed, or the Gospels of Christianity are not their (i.e. individual) teachings, discoveries, or inventions. Religion, according to them, is not man-made but God-given. No, it is the revelation of God through Jesus, say the Christians; through Mohammed the Last in the line of prophets, say the Muslims. Therefore, neither a devout Christian nor a devout Muslim believes that he is following the doctrines of Jesus or Mohammed. These doctrines are \u0026lsquo;revelations\u0026rsquo; of God, albeit through people like Jesus and Mohammed.\nThe Christians follow Christ, to be sure, but Christ is not the family name of Jesus of Nazareth. \u0026lsquo;Christ\u0026rsquo; comes from \u0026lsquo;Christos\u0026rsquo;, which means \u0026rsquo;the messiah\u0026rsquo;, \u0026rsquo;the anointed one\u0026rsquo;, \u0026rsquo;the promised one\u0026rsquo; and such like. According to the Old Testament Bible, God had a covenant with the people of Israel that He will send someone to save them, and this promised one is the Christ. The discussion between the people of the Judaic faith and the Christians revolves precisely around this issue: Is Jesus of Nazareth the Christ, or was he a false messiah? The Christians believe that the Christ came down 2000 years ago, where the Judaic people are still waiting for him.\nEven though Jesus and Mohammed have a very special place in Christianity and Islam respectively, neither Christ nor Mohammed are worshipped there. In their faith, one can worship only God (because this is what God has said), or one can worship the false God (the Devil). In such a case, one is indulging in false worship.\nThey see our \u0026lsquo;puja\u0026rsquo; as worship. The only thing that we could possibly worship is the Devil and His minions. \u0026lsquo;Idolatry\u0026rsquo; is the surface manifestation of Devil\u0026rsquo;s worship \u0026ndash; that is so according to all these three religions.\nThere is Only one God, it is true, but there are false gods as well (according to their theology). Consequently, the question \u0026lsquo;if there is but one God, what matters how you call HIM/HER/IT, or even how you worship?\u0026rsquo; is inadmissible because it is blasphemous. Remember, according to them, God also tells how He should be worshipped, what worshipping Him is, etc.\nTo call Muslims the \u0026lsquo;followers\u0026rsquo; of Mohammed is to call their \u0026lsquo;beliefs\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;practices\u0026rsquo; man-made. To do this is to effectively deny that they are a religion (as they understand it). The Christians (and the Orientalists that Mujeeb refers to) called them (derogatorily) Mohammedans precisely because they believed that God had reveled himself in Christ and that Mohammed founded a new \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo; (or a vague, confused sect). There is no way a devout Christian could accept that Mohammed is the last prophet of God and still remain Christian, any more than some one from the Judaic faith could accept that Jesus was the Christ and not become a Christian.\nThis means many things. All those deva\u0026rsquo;s (often translated as Hindu \u0026lsquo;gods\u0026rsquo;) belong to the subset of the Devil and his minions. This devil is not the Asuras, or the Nagas, or any other entities or beings we know (or heard of.) For all them belong to that set of: devil and his minions.\nIt follows too that the Ancient Greeks, Romans, the entire Asian, African continent worshipped the Devil. Apart from those converted into these three religions (Judaism did it in the first century C.E), the rest of the mankind is doing just one thing: worshipping the devil or his representations.\nYou cannot compare a Buddha, or a Digambara or even a Shankara to either Mohammed or Jesus. People in Christianity or Islam are not \u0026lsquo;saved\u0026rsquo; because they have been good men, great teachers, ethically extremely great, or whatever. Salvation in these religions is totally contingent upon accepting Allah and His prophet, or seeing in Jesus God\u0026rsquo;s plan for the rest of mankind. Buddha is not a great saint: to the Protestants and Muslims he is also a minion of the Devil.\nWhy this long note? Not to provide a short course in theology, but to draw your attention to something else that is far more alluring, important, and worthwhile than having altercations with a Mujeeb or a Naseem. And that is to start reflecting on our experiences, our traditions, our ways of living. Much the same way the Orientalists built an image of the Muslims, they have built even stronger images of ourselves, our so-called \u0026lsquo;hindu religion\u0026rsquo;, etc. These images were not built to flatter us (they were not even reasonably accurate descriptions of our part of the world), but to denigrate us. Question is: why should we reproduce their trash (about both ourselves and others) today? Are we not mature or intelligent enough to reflect about our experiences in the world, our traditions, etc. and see what we have and we do not? And who we are and who we are not?\nl:unet1\n","tags":[],"title":"Are Muslims ‘Mohammedans’?","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/are-muslims-mohammeddans/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","puja","worship"],"content":"About the multiple meanings for the Puja of Ganesha. Of course, there is no one \u0026lsquo;meaning\u0026rsquo; to this act either now, or before, or in the future, as far as Indians (and the Westerners) are concerned. But that is not being disputed. The dispute arises when some meaning is alleged to portray the \u0026rsquo;experience\u0026rsquo; of a culture, when all it does is distort and deny the experience it is said to portray. However, there is an interesting question here, which is best illustrated using a contrast. In the Catholic Mass, there are limits on what it could be said to mean to a believer. These limits are set by the Catholic theology and belief. (For instance, to a believer, it cannot mean celebrating the Devil.) The puja of Ganesha does not set any such limits to the person who does this puja. (But if someone comes and tells me that I cook sweets on Ganesha Chaturthi because it expresses my \u0026lsquo;subconscious\u0026rsquo; desire for Oral Sex, I am justified in challenging this claim as an \u0026rsquo;explanation\u0026rsquo; of my cooking the sweets.) Here is the question: what is puja in the Indian traditions, if it does not have a particular meaning, and there are no limits on what it means? One thing is already clear: it cannot mean \u0026lsquo;worship\u0026rsquo;! These are the kind of questions I would like to ask; not what \u0026lsquo;interpretation\u0026rsquo; one gives to some action or the other. The answer I give should be capable of being \u0026rsquo;tested\u0026rsquo; in the Indian culture. Then, I will have begun producing an \u0026lsquo;objective\u0026rsquo; theory.\nIf you were to ask 100 knowledgeable Indians about the \u0026rsquo;thondam\u0026rsquo; of Ganesha, you are probably likely to get 50 different answers, all of which are \u0026lsquo;satisfactory\u0026rsquo; in some sense or the other. From this situation, you can go one of the two ways. One is what appears to us as the more familiar way: which of the 50 answers is the right one? The second is to ask ourselves the questions: why do all these answers appear acceptable? What does this tell about what a question is and what answers are in the Indian traditions? In other words, we take the \u0026lsquo;facts\u0026rsquo; that our cultures present us with as \u0026lsquo;problems\u0026rsquo; that require solutions.\nWhy do we want to do this? It is because how we \u0026lsquo;understand\u0026rsquo; our culture is thickly overlaid with what other cultures have told us about ourselves. Consequently, we misunderstand ourselves. We need to do research and yet more research in order to understand ourselves and the others.\n","tags":[],"title":"Multiple meanings: puja, thondam—S.N.

I am not willing to buy it. However, it is a fact that in some cultures people do perform \u0026lsquo;rain dances\u0026rsquo;. However, to explain the \u0026lsquo;rain dance\u0026rsquo; by attributing a \u0026lsquo;causative story\u0026rsquo; is to trivialize such an experience: you are transforming the members of that group into a bunch of idiots.\nIn an attempt to shed some light on this matter, I would like to refer to a debate between the famous Dr. Livingstone and a Tswana \u0026lsquo;Rain Doctor\u0026rsquo;. The discussion, of course, is about the \u0026lsquo;rain dance\u0026rsquo;:\n\u0026ldquo;Medical Doctor : So you really believe that you can command the clouds? I think that can be done by God alone.\nRain Doctor: We both believe the very same thing. It is God that makes the rain, but I pray to him by means of these medicines, and, the rain coming, of course it is then mine. … Medical Doctor: I only think you are mistaken in saying that you have medicines which can influence the rain at all.\nRain Doctor: That\u0026rsquo;s just the way people speak when they talk on a subject of which they have no knowledge. When first we opened our eyes, we found our forefathers making rain, and we follow in their footsteps. You, who send to Kuruman for corn, and irrigate your garden, may do without rain, we cannot manage in that way\u0026rdquo;. (Cited in J. \u0026amp; J. Comaroff: Of Revelation and Revolution: Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa, The University of Chicago Press, 1991, p. 210-211)\nI would like to invite the reader to take these sentences at face value. It is clear that the \u0026lsquo;rain doctor\u0026rsquo; agrees with Livingstone that he does not command the clouds. Only when he performs the ritual and the rain comes only then does he consider the rain his. In other words, the \u0026lsquo;rain doctor\u0026rsquo; does not claim a causal relationship. He only says that he considers the rain his, when he has done the performance and if it then starts to rain. But this is not how Dr. Livingstone understands the matter. The \u0026lsquo;medical doctor\u0026rsquo; insists that there can be no medicines which can influence the rain to fall. That neither of the two understand each other becomes clear when we look at the response of the \u0026lsquo;rain doctor\u0026rsquo;. He gets irritated and refers to what his forefathers did. Livingstone is looking for an answer to the question how it is possible that the dance cause rains to come and wants an explanation. As far as the rain dancer is concerned, the discussion is not even about creating water. Consequently, irrigation is not an alternative as far as he is concerned. For him, the discussion is about continuing what has always been done in his culture. Hence his claim \u0026ldquo;When first we opened our eyes, we found our forefathers making rain, and we follow in their footsteps\u0026rdquo;. In other words, it is about what his people do; for Livingstone the discussion is about what the Tswana people believe.\nIt is here that Wittgenstein\u0026rsquo;s observations become relevant, indeed. He says: \u0026ldquo;The very idea of wanting to explain a practice … seems wrong to me. What kind of explanation was he thinking of? The one Frazer provided of course. What did Frazer provide? Stories, beliefs, worldviews, etc. which were believed to explain the practice, that is, cause of these practices, so to speak. What else did Wittgenstein say? All that Frazer does is to make the practices plausible \u0026ldquo;to people who think as he does\u0026rdquo;. I invite you to consider the possibility that Wittgenstein was not just thinking about other individuals. In fact, research reveals that what Frazer did, was the dominant way of doing in the West. In other words, one could paraphrase Wittgenstein\u0026rsquo;s remark thus: All that Frazer does is to make practices plausible to people in the West. In other words, Wittgenstein is making an observation about the culture of the West. What does his insight boil down to? That people in the West search for beliefs, of which the practices are an expression, to make sense of practices. Livingstone asked the rain doctor why he believed that dancing caused rain. It is very remarkable that in the final analysis all these practices are presented as, so to speak, pieces of stupidity. But it will never be plausible to say that mankind does all that out of sheer stupidity.\u0026rdquo; (From \u0026ldquo;Remarks on Frazer\u0026rsquo;s Golden Bough\u0026rdquo;).\nI will not go into the issue of stupidity again, but I will focus on the other things instead. As far as Wittgenstein is concerned, the problem - i.e. the distortion of other cultures - is caused by a desire to explain a practice. Trying to explain a practice by referring to a theory or belief, is the \u0026lsquo;only\u0026rsquo; way for us (the Westerners) to make the others plausible, i.e. to make sense of them. In other words, for us Westerners, for some actions to be coherent, a story, a belief, a theory, or worldview is needed which lends coherence to the actions. That actions can derive their consistency from actions themselves is an option which is clouded by the constraints of the Western culture.\nWhat if there are cultures where beliefs have nothing do to with how people go about in the world (i.e., they are not constitutive of this going about in the world)? If they do exist, it must be obvious that they must possess other kinds of knowledge, i.e. kinds of knowledge that differ from what we are familiar with. Does it make sense to think so? I believe it does. Balu has offered an intriguing and convincing beginning in his book, where he explores and makes sense of this idea. The gist of his arguments cannot be summarized here.\nOther cultures do possess knowledge. And, yes, current social sciences do block access to that knowledge.\n","tags":[],"title":"Is Rain dance superstitious?—Willem Derde","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/is-rain-dance-superstitious-willem-derde/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","basics","criticism"],"content":"\u0026ldquo;Every one of us believes our own viewpoint to be the best one: such is human nature.\u0026rdquo; This is not quite how I would put it. Let me, therefore say what I think with respect to this issue.\nWhenever I formulate a theory, I believe that my description is \u0026rsquo;true\u0026rsquo;. If I thought that it was \u0026lsquo;false\u0026rsquo;, I would not write what I write. This is a belief about the status of my description and its relationship to the part of reality I describe. Let us call this the \u0026lsquo;object-level\u0026rsquo; belief.\nRelative to this, I also have a meta-level belief about my own theories. Do I believe that my theory is \u0026rsquo;the truth?\u0026rsquo; No, I do not. As a student of the history of the natural sciences, I know that there has no single theory that can claim this status. A better theory has come along and displaced the older theory. This has been the story of scientific progress. I believe that I am doing science. Therefore, I believe that, one day, a better theory will come and displace my own. According to the best criteria of rationality and scientificity we have today, I do think that my theory is better than any others that exist currently in the market place. That is why I defend my theory. It is also my hope that another, better theory will come into being in the near future. If it does happen, I will have succeeded in my aim: because of my theory, a better theory comes into being. That means to say, my labor has been scientific in nature and has contributed to the furthering of human knowledge. That is all what I want: to contribute to human knowledge. However, one needs to remember that my theory can only be displaced by a theory that is better than mine.\nIn other words, both the object-level belief about my theory (that my description is a \u0026rsquo;true\u0026rsquo; description) and a meta-level belief about the same (that my description is hypothetical and tentative) are present in me in so far as it is a scientific endeavor, which is human. I want to believe I am both: scientific and human.\n","tags":[],"title":"Whose view is better?—S.N.Balagangadhara","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/whose-view-is-better-s-n-balagangadhara/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","caste"],"content":"A question: Is it desirable to have a model that can simulate social and cultural changes?\nI cannot see what good reason there is not to find it desirable. It would be eminently desirable. It will take some time though before we get there, but we will surely get there. Thanks to computers, we have a possibility of talking realistically about simulation. However, we have to still go a very long way before we are able to do so. We need to build some theories about social and cultural change and evolution; we need to develop suitable algorithms for simulating these changes; we need to develop more and different kinds of logics (non-monotonic ones) than exist today; we need to simulate some relevant aspects of human reasoning process … It is only now that we are beginning to simulate the evolutionary process and have developed some kinds of algorithms to do so. We need to overlay this with developments (hardly understood today) about social dynamics and cultural dynamics. And then study what could happen. So, it is definitely going to take some time. In all probability, we will first start simulating some fragments of social or cultural reality first (after all, this is what modeling means).\n(a) It has always been my dream (and some kind of vague conviction that it can be done) to simulate the growth of \u0026rsquo;the Indian caste system\u0026rsquo;: I think a fundamental aspect of the \u0026lsquo;caste structure\u0026rsquo; is recursive in nature. The only thing (!) one has to do is to isolate the principles (probably they will be four or five at the most) and use something like the genetic algorithm to simulate its growth, disintegration and recombination. (This is probably the only way to check the \u0026rsquo;truth\u0026rsquo; of any theory about the nature of the caste system.)\n(b) I think some aspects of the western culture are susceptible to a simulation as well. I think that the dynamics of its \u0026rsquo;norms\u0026rsquo; and this culture\u0026rsquo;s basic strategies of social co-operation can be simulated. The empirical history would be the check for the accuracy of such a simulation.\n(c) If both (a) and (b) can be done, then we can simulate an aspect of \u0026lsquo;colonialism\u0026rsquo; as an interaction between (a) and (b). Again, we have the colonial history functioning as a check about what is simulated.\nIn all probability, simulation is how we can test the \u0026rsquo;truth\u0026rsquo; of theories about the social and cultural world. That we have not been able to do this so far has more to do with the state of our knowledge than with the nature of cultural and social realities.\n","tags":[],"title":"Simulation of social and cultural changes?—S.N.

One of his replies is alleged to have been the following: \u0026ldquo;Even a pygmy sees further than the giants if he stands upon their shoulders. And I, Sir, stand upon the shoulders of giants.\u0026rdquo; The extraordinary humility apart, there is something very important to what Newton is saying: his theory would not have been there, if the theories of Copernicus and Galileo were not there before him. It is, of course, a historical accident that certain people preceded Newton. This allowed Newton, however, to write his Principia.\nIn a way, this is all I am saying. Thanks to the writings that exist today, I can build my theory. The errors and mistakes (or however one characterizes them) provide me with the problem-situation. Why certain errors are systematically committed? This is one question. The second question is with respect to the nature of the phenomenon they studied where these errors exist. All I am doing is developing a hypothesis that links these two together: for instance, I say, it is in the nature of religion (this is one aspect) that it makes those who have it want to see religion in all cultures (this is the second aspect). Taken together, the hypothesis not only tells us what religion is, but also explains the errors of the previous generations.\nPerhaps, another example would explain why there is nothing extraordinary to what I am doing. If there is a systematic error committed by people in identifying a certain color under artificial light, your hypothesis will explain both why people commit the error and, at the same time, why some color appears differently under artificial light.\nOf course, in my case, cultures and their descriptions are involved and not color perception in natural and artificial light. But that has to do with the nature of the domain that is being investigated. For the rest, they are symmetric as far as their cognitive structure is concerned.\nIn other words, I am saying that my \u0026lsquo;Indianness\u0026rsquo; is no barrier to building a theory about cultural differences because I have the work of previous generations to lean on. Without them, I could not have done what I have done so far. I can only be grateful to them for this.\nWill my theory be challenged? I hope so. Otherwise, there is no hope of scientific progress. Where would science be, if there was no criticism and disputation? But the thing to note is this: my theory can be challenged, improved, rejected, modified, etc. thesame way you do any or all of these things in the natural sciences. The same, however, cannot at all be said of the competitor \u0026rsquo;theories\u0026rsquo;, whether of a Wendy, of a Kripal, of a John Hicks, or of a Ninian Smart.

In human contacts, of course. What kind of human contacts? In inter-individual contacts. That is, we see (or sense, or intuit or whatever) cultural differences in our contacts with individual human beings. You do not meet \u0026rsquo;the western culture\u0026rsquo; but individual Americans, Germans, French, etc. Neither do these individuals meet \u0026rsquo;the Indian culture\u0026rsquo;: they meet individual Indians (or, even better, a \u0026lsquo;Madrasi Brahmin\u0026rsquo;, a \u0026lsquo;Gujerati Baniya\u0026rsquo; - even these are general categories but I use them just to get the point across.) And yet, we appear to see cultural differences in these contacts. How to make \u0026lsquo;sense\u0026rsquo; of this experience? Let us first see what is partially involved to truly appreciate the complexity of our \u0026lsquo;perception\u0026rsquo;. 1.1. Each individual human being is a complex combination of at least four aspects. There is his biological (or genetic) inheritance; there is his \u0026lsquo;social\u0026rsquo; inheritance (whether he is from the Middle Ages or from a capitalist society); there is his psychological makeup (let us say his \u0026lsquo;personality\u0026rsquo;); and there is his cultural upbringing (whether he is a Madhva Brahmin or a Lingayat, say). When we meet individuals, in many different ways we notice these differences: the biological, the psychological and, after some time perhaps, \u0026rsquo;the social\u0026rsquo; and \u0026rsquo;the cultural\u0026rsquo;. Let us bracket the biological away so that the situation becomes deliciously complex. Let us agree to use the following \u0026lsquo;words\u0026rsquo; (they are just words for now) in order to go ahead and raise the problem. Let us call the \u0026lsquo;social aspects\u0026rsquo; of a person the \u0026lsquo;sociality\u0026rsquo; of the person; the psychological aspects the \u0026lsquo;personality\u0026rsquo; of the person; and the \u0026lsquo;cultural\u0026rsquo; aspects the \u0026lsquo;culturality\u0026rsquo; of the person. Thus we meet individual human beings and see the differences between ourselves and the other human beings. What kinds of differences do we see?\n1.2. Let us say you come across someone like the following: a Belgian who is living in America driving a Japanese Car. He is married to an African, loves Chinese music and is crazy about Indian food. He prefers jeans, wears a tie, is a bit short-tempered and has a terrific sense of humor. Each week he goes to the \u0026lsquo;Unitarian Church\u0026rsquo;, calls himself an atheist and a behaviorist, and is a nuclear scientist. And so on and so forth. Let us say, you are just his opposite in many things, and yet you become friends (so that you get to know each other well). In other words, you notice many differences (more than you can say) between yourself and this person.\n1.3. From among all these differences, which express his sociality, which his culturality and which his personality? And for what reasons are they that? Notice that you cannot \u0026lsquo;solve\u0026rsquo; these questions by giving definitions of what \u0026lsquo;culture\u0026rsquo; etc. mean to you. Every one of us has the same freedom to define the terms any which way we want and your definition is my counter example. Nor can you undertake some kind of a statistical survey to answer them because it is not evident what you are looking for. Does the above person belong to one \u0026lsquo;culture\u0026rsquo;, many \u0026lsquo;cultures\u0026rsquo;, or to none? Are his \u0026lsquo;personal traits\u0026rsquo; personal, social, cultural or biological? The answer that it is both \u0026rsquo;nature\u0026rsquo; and \u0026rsquo;nurture\u0026rsquo; is not adequate in our case. We need to know what \u0026rsquo;nature\u0026rsquo; is and \u0026rsquo;nurture\u0026rsquo; has at least three aspects in this case: his personality, his sociality and his culturality.\n1.4. Put even more sharply, but in general terms: what makes some difference, any difference, into a cultural difference as against, say, social or psychological difference? (Somehow, in our contacts with individual human beings, we must have answered this question, even if none of us know what that answer is. Otherwise, we could not see \u0026lsquo;cultural\u0026rsquo; differences.) Normally, one would expect Anthropology to have answered this question. But you are going to come out bitterly disappointed if you were to seek the answer either in their ethnographic texts or in their \u0026rsquo;theoretical\u0026rsquo; treatises. They do not even ask this question, let alone solve it. Their ethnography presupposes cultural differences without saying what they are; their theoretical tracts still have not progressed beyond disputes about definitions of \u0026lsquo;culture\u0026rsquo; and silly \u0026rsquo;theories\u0026rsquo; about \u0026lsquo;human culture\u0026rsquo;.\n1.5. My research project, which I call \u0026lsquo;comparative science of cultures\u0026rsquo; (actually it sounds better in Dutch and German than it does in English) begins with this question: what makes some difference, any difference, into a cultural difference?\u0026rsquo; I discovered that to answer this one has to develop a theory of cultural differences and my study of the western culture and the Indian one (sliced along several different themes) begins the process of developing precisely such a theory. The \u0026lsquo;iti, iti\u0026rsquo; answer (that I have now) can be given in a single sentence, but one cannot understand it without understanding the theory I am building. (\u0026lsquo;Cultural difference is the how of using the mechanisms of socialization\u0026rsquo;.)\nWhat I have discovered during the last two decades is this then: to say what is \u0026lsquo;cultural experience\u0026rsquo; requires taking recourse to a theory about cultural differences. That is to say, it is one thing to \u0026rsquo;experience\u0026rsquo; cultural differences, but it is a task of an entirely different magnitude to say what this experience consists of or what makes it \u0026lsquo;cultural\u0026rsquo;. I am developing conceptual tools to \u0026lsquo;access\u0026rsquo; my own experiences and interrogate them. That is, to speak of our experiences as \u0026lsquo;cultural\u0026rsquo; experiences we need theories that enable us to make this distinction (between \u0026lsquo;cultural\u0026rsquo; and \u0026rsquo;non-cultural\u0026rsquo; say) and explain cultural differences. Otherwise, we can just keep talking any nonsense that comes to our head and insist that such an experience is \u0026lsquo;cultural\u0026rsquo;. (Many, many discussions are ample illustrations of this tendency. Everyone is an \u0026rsquo;expert\u0026rsquo; on saying what a \u0026lsquo;cultural practice\u0026rsquo; is, why it is/could be a \u0026lsquo;superstitious\u0026rsquo; practice and such like without even having the faintest idea of what is being talked about!)\nIt varies from individual to individual and that is true with respect to all cultures and not just the Indian one. The insider/outsider distinction is empty when it comes to saying what cultural differences are: it is the task for building a scientific theory about specific cultural differences, and to build such a theory the passport of a person is strictly irrelevant. So, can we \u0026rsquo;extract abiding universals\u0026rsquo;? No, we cannot and that in two senses. (a) Any theory we build will be hypothetical (the way scientific theories are), and not abiding in any sense of the word. (Besides, cultures themselves are dynamic entities: they evolve and change, do they not?) (b) We will not be \u0026rsquo;extracting\u0026rsquo; some universal facts that require accounting. (Philosophically speaking, developing a scientific theory in our case is not the task of inducing some general patterns from trillions and trillions of facts. It would be impossible. I will simply state this baldly.)\nIf that is the case, how do we go about identifying the problems requiring solutions? We must be truly thankful that Kripal and his forefathers exist! They give us one objective aspect of the problem. Instead of talking about it in the abstract, let me give an example.\n4.1. We notice that, in the hands of Kripal, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa\u0026rsquo;s mysticism becomes an expression of homo-eroticism. Most of us do get upset and express this as well. One reaction: an unscientific response is to do what some members on Sulekha site did. Convinced of their own intelligence and of our utter stupidity they come up with some third-rate \u0026lsquo;atheism\u0026rsquo; as though they have re-discovered the wheel all on their own. That is, they do not even sense the problem. Second response: not being geniuses like them, you and I sense something has \u0026lsquo;gone wrong\u0026rsquo; somewhere. This is the first step. What has \u0026lsquo;gone wrong\u0026rsquo;? We start reading around, say, the articles from Rajiv Malhotra and Sankrant Sanu. What do we find out? This way of talking does not appear to be confined to Kripal alone. Therefore, there is a reasonable suspicion that it might not merely be an expression of an individual idiosyncrasy of Jeffrey Kripal. This is the second step. Let us say, we assume that it is the syndrome of Wendy\u0026rsquo;s children. So, we read a bit more, from different people, from different periods of time (say the travellers\u0026rsquo; reports about India). They say the same things, but use a different imagery and a different jargon. This is the third step. We see that it is not merely a question of Kripal\u0026rsquo;s idiosyncrasy or merely a question of Wendy\u0026rsquo;s child syndrome (even if they are both) but that it encompasses people\u0026rsquo;s reports from the western culture as well. This is the fourth step. May be, it has to do with \u0026rsquo;the western culture\u0026rsquo;. At this moment, we merely have an intuitive idea of what \u0026lsquo;western culture\u0026rsquo; is. So, we read a bit more: say, what the Islamic rulers and writers said about our traditions. We see that they said more or less the same things. This is the fifth step. So, it could be all of the above and yet might have something to do with what \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo; is. (After all, both Christianity and Islam are religions.) Then, because we are Indians, we read and reflect about what we said about Christianity and Islam. We do not appear to have said similar things at all. This is the sixth step. Two possibilities open up: either our \u0026lsquo;religions\u0026rsquo; are special; or, they might not be \u0026lsquo;religions\u0026rsquo; at all. Then you start reading about religion and thinking again … This process continues until you are able to formulate a tractable problem and come up with a testable hypothesis.\n4.2. We are not \u0026lsquo;inducing\u0026rsquo; anything by first collecting trillions upon trillions of facts. We are doing research that is hypothesis driven, and which is being tested at every step. But what was the starting point? The \u0026lsquo;feeling\u0026rsquo; that something is \u0026lsquo;wrong\u0026rsquo; (cognitively wrong, that is) with Kripal\u0026rsquo;s description of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa. Of course, my description above is cooked up in the sense that our research is never that simple or that straightforwardly progressive and cumulative. There will be false starts, blind alleys, inabilities to see the \u0026lsquo;obvious\u0026rsquo; at times, etc. But that is a process of all scientific enquiries.\n4.3. To discover that stories like Kripal trivialize and distort our experience (however simple that formulation might sound) required scientific research that has stretched for nearly two decades now. This is not the beginning point, but one of the results of research. However, this is merely autobiographical. Today, the results of my research can become the starting points for a new, the younger generation of intellectuals. This is what scientific research enables. On this, I pin my hopes.\nIt is true I emphasize that the majority of the social sciences take a particular experience of the world for granted and assume as \u0026lsquo;universally true\u0026rsquo; the assumptions that structure such an experience. Not only do I identify these premises as Christian theological in nature, but also criticize them. Of course, I do not stop at just criticizing them but go further in an attempt to provide an alternative theory. What does this imply with respect to the limitations of my own theory? The answer has to do with two things. 5.1. What exactly is the nature of my criticism? Firstly, I criticize these theories for not being \u0026lsquo;scientific\u0026rsquo;. That in two senses: (a) I say they are secularized Christian theologies. (b) And that they are not scientific because they are not cognizant of this. Secondly, now comes the important question: could they have been any different? According to my story, they could not have been. I can put this answer in another way: the western intellectuals were constrained by their culture (the nature of religion and its relation to the western culture) to theorize how they did. In other words, I do not call it their failure, even though it is a cognitive failure, when looked at as an issue of producing knowledge (i.e. as an epistemological issue). If one were to pose the issue abstractly, i.e. without taking the real and historical dynamics of producing scientific knowledge, then exactly the same criticism (i.e. the constraints of the culture) would have been applicable to whoever theorized first. If Indian culture had developed the \u0026lsquo;social sciences\u0026rsquo; first, it would also have been hampered by its cultural constraints.\n5.2. However, this cognitive failure of the western culture provides an extremely important reference point (or provides one set of problems) thanks to which I can escape the constraints of my culture and become subservient only to the dynamics of producing scientific theories. That is to say, the development and replacement of my theories will be subject to the dynamics that govern any scientific theory, and only to that. Let me make this abstract answer concrete by taking two examples of my theory production: one from the book you are reading and the other from my forthcoming book.\nMy theory of religion answers two questions simultaneously: what is the nature of religion? Why did the western intellectuals see religion in every culture? The answer to one is also the answer to the other. No ad hoc assumptions intervene in the process of answering the first question and deriving the answers to the second. In other words, the cognitive failure of the western culture is a problem I have to solve and the solution to this problem has to be derived (in some appropriate sense) from my theory about that phenomenon which they failed to understand. (This must be done without adding ad hoc assumptions.)\nThe western ethical traditions transform us either into immoral peoples or moral cretins. To show that we are neither, I need to develop a theory of ethics that (a) shows that there are ethical traditions in the Indian culture; (b) explains the western \u0026rsquo;theories\u0026rsquo; of ethics and the corresponding perception. That is to say, my theory of ethics will include the western \u0026rsquo;theories\u0026rsquo; as its limiting case. Under specific assumptions, I must show how you can go from a theory of ethics I develop (which, I claim, is the Indian ethics) to the western ethics.\nIn other words, my story (though drawn from my culture) has to account for sets of theories that are constrained by the western culture. It is not simply a story about how we \u0026rsquo;experience\u0026rsquo; the world. It not only does more; it is forced to do more if it aspires to be scientific. Such a scientific story, then, can be developed by any one from any culture (see my declaration at the beginning of the target article); if it is replaced, it will be because the better theory will do the job better. In other words, my story will become subordinated to the dynamics of scientific growth and progress of science. That is why, as I see it, the \u0026lsquo;Indian Renaissance\u0026rsquo; is of significance and importance not just to us but to the human community and human knowledge.\nA question: \u0026ldquo;So shouldn\u0026rsquo;t social science (in this instance, a science of culture) seek to explain what we observe or perceive of different societies (in this instance cultures)?\nThe question, when it comes to culture, is whose perception and how do we define that perception? What we observe of the physical world is pretty much the same irrespective of our own culture, but when we make observations about societies (and cultures), what we observe, how we perceive seems to differ from observer to observer, and more widely between outsiders and insiders. So whose observations are the social scientists supposed to explain? And how do they define what that perception is? Do they have to take the perceiver\u0026rsquo;s word for it? Or better put, don\u0026rsquo;t they have to take the perceiver\u0026rsquo;s word for it?\u0026rdquo; Let me now see which questions I have answered, and which I have not.\n7.1. The first question. Yes, the science of culture should indeed explain what we perceive. We also seem to perceive cultural differences even where we cannot (without such a science) say what we perceive.\n7.2. Let me state one general point. Even though the natural world is invariant, the way we experience this world is, somehow and to some extent, dependent upon the theories we use to say what we experience. (There is a huge debate about this issue, and it is not yet settled one way or another. We do not, as yet, even have a decent theory of perception. Research, for example, in Computer Vision is trying to simulate some aspects of perception of objects and motion etc). This is true for our cultural world too: we can say what we see depending upon what \u0026rsquo;theories\u0026rsquo; we bring to bear on what we see and say. Dependent to what extent? This is not a philosophical question, but one for scientific research. The theories about cultural differences have the onus of answering this question partially as well.\n","tags":["Jeffrey Kripal","Wendy Doniger"],"title":"How to produce knowledge about people and their cultures?—S.N. Balagangadhara","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/how-to-produce-knowledge-about-people-and-their-cultures-s-n-balagangadhara/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","basics","social sciences"],"content":"I do not believe that any cultural practice (i.e. a practice that has survived and been transmitted through successive generations) should be explained by attributing beliefs to its practitioners in such a way that the beliefs make the practitioners come out stupid. Why do I say this? There are primarily two reasons: our ignorance and the principle of \u0026lsquo;charity\u0026rsquo;. Let me explain.\n(a) Our ignorance. We know very little about how cultures come into being, how they reproduce themselves and how they disappear. Until such a stage, where we are able to discuss each cultural practice (like rain dance, for example) individually, we should avoid making a virtue of our ignorance. One could come up with any number of explanations today to explain a cultural practice like rain dance. Without exception, they would all be ad hoc in nature and, as such, the opposite of what a scientific explanation is. Therefore, my criticism of such explanations is to show their ad hoc character and, where possible, identify what makes them ad hoc. The purpose? To move forward in order to develop a science of cultures and cultural differences.\n(b) The principle of charity. While both intelligence and stupidity are not exclusive prerogatives of any one particular set of people belonging to any one culture, explanations that attribute causal beliefs to the practitioners of, say, the rain dance do make an entire culture appear stupid. How? Assume for a moment we attribute to the people who perform the rain dance the following belief: they believe that their dance causes the rains to come. Precisely because of our ignorance about the dynamics of cultures, we are forced to make this attribution more general and say that such is their notion of causal forces that they believe in the causal efficacy of their rain dance. (We have no way, at the moment, to limit our attribution only to performing the rain dance.) Then the question becomes: are they not aware of the operation of causal forces? Do they not know that the boats are caused by their work on wood? Are they not aware that rains come when they do not dance and, therefore, that there are (at least) other causes? Do they have the concept of cause at all? So on and so forth. Because the practice is transmitted over generations, and it is considered important by that culture, we will be forced by the logic of our argument to extend the same attribution to the culture as a whole. Consequently, the entire culture is made to appear stupid. They may not have our (current) natural sciences, but my principle of charity tells me not to assume their stupidity because of this. In other words, I assume they are as reasonable as any other group of human beings. If it was as simple as believing in the causal efficacy of their dance, surely, I believe, many intelligent people in their culture would have questioned it, ridiculed it, and so on. My principle of charity tells me that if it has survived, then that is not because they have no notion of cause and causal forces. (Besides, I think such a group would not survive as a group for any period of time.) This is the principle of charity: assume that the other person (group, culture) is at least as reasonable as you (your group, your culture) and try to understand them thus. Consequently, my objections rest on at least on these two grounds.\n(c) How defensible is this position? How \u0026lsquo;scientific\u0026rsquo; is this? This is a philosophical assumption in whose favor I have some evidence. It is, however, important to note that this assumption functions as a heuristic of research and not as a premise in my arguments. Consequently, if my research forces me to say that some culture X or Y is stupid, I would do so. But that result must be scientifically demonstrable.\n","tags":[],"title":"On explanations that make people stupid—S.N.Balagangadhara","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/on-explanations-that-make-people-stupid-s-n-balagangadhara/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","puja","erudition"],"content":" The first point is the difficulty involved in specifying what the \u0026ldquo;real meaning of an experience\u0026rdquo; consists of. Asking an insider would not help us here: the insider may or may not know what the real meaning of his/her own experience is or even how to go about putting it in words.\nAssuming that the first problem somehow gets solved, the second problem lies in the multiplicities of such meanings: if people differ on what any particular experience means to them (for instance, what doing Puja to Ganesha means to my brother does not mean the same to my sister), which should we choose and for what reason? This problem is virtually unsolvable, especially when you take the interpretations of the past into consideration as well.\nThis is not an \u0026lsquo;insider/outsider\u0026rsquo; issue. If we emphasize the \u0026lsquo;real meaning of lived experience\u0026rsquo;, it confronts the \u0026lsquo;insiders\u0026rsquo; as well as the \u0026lsquo;outsiders\u0026rsquo; because neither will have a privileged access to the meanings of other lived experiences. (I might assume that I have a privileged access to my brother\u0026rsquo;s experience. But this is a just an assumption. By the same token, Jeffrey Kripal might argue that he has spoken to thousands of people and that, therefore, assumes he has a \u0026lsquo;more\u0026rsquo; privileged access than I have. Both our assumptions are just that; unjustified assumptions. In my view, they are also unjustifiable.)\nIf we have to get out of this quandary, we need to do something radical with respect to what counts as knowledge and what does not in the field of \u0026lsquo;social sciences\u0026rsquo;. My response has so far been to accept the best criteria of rationality and scientificity that the study of the history and philosophy of (natural) sciences has brought forth. Not only do I believe that it is possible to build theories in the field of \u0026lsquo;humanities\u0026rsquo; that answer these criteria; in fact, I claim I already have. In my book, I have developed hypotheses about religion that can be tested the way you test any hypothesis in, say, physics. (Of course, I also have an \u0026rsquo;explanation\u0026rsquo; why it had not happened so far. But that is another issue.)\nIn the book I am now currently writing on \u0026rsquo;ethics\u0026rsquo; (it develops an understanding of the Indian ethics and contrasts that with the western normative ethics), the same attitude is present. As far as I can see, my theory about \u0026rsquo;ethics\u0026rsquo; can be tested in exactly the same way as well.\nWith respect to what stories are to a culture. This is a question of having some kind of a theory about \u0026lsquo;cultural differences\u0026rsquo;, the ways in which, say, the Indian culture differs from the western one. Accounting these differences will include, inter alia, such issues as the role of stories in that culture. One of the crucial tests for evaluating your claims about any culture, including the Indian culture, is the extent to which your theory makes sense of the experiences of the Indians without denying, distorting, or transforming those experiences. To come back to my favorite example: such theories about the Indian culture must do what Galileo\u0026rsquo;s theory did. Not tell us we are hallucinating or wrong about our experiences (as though the experiences could be false!), but show us why we experience the world the way we do.\nSuch a stance places a high demand on an intellectual: not everyone who writes about some culture or another is capable of producing knowledge. Stands to reason. Not everyone who studies physics is capable of doing research in physics either. The exact same thing is applicable to the humanities and the \u0026lsquo;social sciences\u0026rsquo;. Wendy and her children, in this sense, are not producing knowledge just by reading some books, going to India on extended holidays, and picking up some random nonsense and say that it is an \u0026lsquo;interpretation\u0026rsquo; of Indian culture. There is a difference between being \u0026rsquo;erudite\u0026rsquo; (or appearing to be one) and producing knowledge. My quarrel with Jeffrey Kripal is whether he has produced knowledge. I have argued he has not and that he cannot. It is up to him to show that contrary is the case. As you no doubt know, he has not.\n","tags":[],"title":"Why Insider/Outsider game is sterile?—S.N.Balagangadhara","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/why-insideroutsider-game-is-sterile-s-n-balagangadhara/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","secularization","social sciences"],"content":" The general pattern that has come to the fore is that Wendy and her children (including Jeffrey Kripal) systematically portray the Indian traditions in an unfavorable light, even when compared to how religions like Christianity, Islam and Judaism are portrayed. This claim is made in several articles, independent of whether these religions and the Indian traditions are true or false, whether they are irrational or rational, and so on. The discussion is not about the truth-claims of these religions and traditions but about their depictions.\nBecause this is a systematic phenomenon, the obvious question is about the \u0026lsquo;why\u0026rsquo;. One of the possible explanations is that these portrayals are \u0026lsquo;Orientalist\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;racist\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;Eurocentric\u0026rsquo; in nature. My point is that this explanation is not adequate because it ends up transforming all writers, who provide such descriptions into \u0026lsquo;racist\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;Eurocentric\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;Orientalist\u0026rsquo; as the case may be. These writers include not just the western scholars but many, if not most, Indian ones as well.\nI account for this state of affairs by suggesting that the modern social sciences are secularized Christian theologies. One cannot draw on this fund of \u0026lsquo;knowledge\u0026rsquo; and contribute further to it without, in some sense, becoming \u0026rsquo;theologians\u0026rsquo; as well. In another post, I have provided some considerations to make this extravagant claim appear less counter-intuitive. Before my argument can become plausible, I need to solve many cognitive problems; before it becomes worthy of further research along the lines I suggest, some alternative conceptualizations have to be provided. In my book on religion I believe to have done both.\nIf what I claim is true, one has to show that the same holds good for Kripal as well. That is to say, one has to show that he cannot possibly have produced knowledge about Ramakrishna Paramahamsa or his mysticism. Again, one possible way of doing it is to challenge the truth-claims of psychoanalysis. (That is, one can try to show why this discipline is not a science.) But this would not be sufficient for my purposes. I need to show that he could not have produced knowledge and that his stance prevents him from even recognizing this fact. I do this by showing that his object of study is not the experience he claims he is studying: his \u0026rsquo;explanations\u0026rsquo; trivialize and distort the Indian cultural experience, which is his object of study.\nThere is something more that requires doing. If social sciences cannot produce knowledge, this must be true whether they study the western culture or \u0026rsquo;non-western\u0026rsquo; cultures. I suggest that it is true by showing (or suggesting, if you find that I have not \u0026lsquo;shown\u0026rsquo; it adequately in my reply to Jeffrey Kripal) that attempting to explain the \u0026lsquo;origin of religion\u0026rsquo; by appealing to a set of natural causes distorts his object of study. As I put it, atheism is a philosophical option, but if one embraces it to study the origin and nature of religion, one cannot do science. To become a theist and study religion is to do theology and not science. In other words, I point out that he faces a dilemma and that, by virtue of this, he could not be contributing to human knowledge by doing what he does.\nOf course, this unsatisfactory state of affairs about the nature of social sciences has not gone unnoticed in the western intellectual history. Even though, as far as I know, no intellectual has argued (or seen) this case in its generality, many people have responded to many aspects of this situation in many different ways over a period of time. Ludwig Wittgenstein, the Austrian philosopher, is one such. He was dissatisfied with the nature of philosophical enquiries in the western culture and tried to arrive at some understanding of the nature of philosophical problems and their purported solutions. His writings are not systematic elaborations in the form of a theory; he formulates some of his startling insights in at times condensed, at times cryptic manner.\nSir James Frazer wrote a multi-volume work called \u0026lsquo;The Golden Bough\u0026rsquo;, an \u0026lsquo;anthropological\u0026rsquo; compendium of stories-cum-explanations about certain kinds of practices in cultures. Wittgenstein wrote down some of his remarks, which were published (posthumously, if my memory serves me right) as \u0026lsquo;Remarks\u0026rsquo; on that book. (I am not sure whether he read all the volumes, or read only the abridged edition of Frazer\u0026rsquo;s book.) In any case, he does not find the Frazer\u0026rsquo;s \u0026rsquo;explanations\u0026rsquo; satisfactory because they transform all \u0026rsquo;non-western\u0026rsquo; cultures into idiotic ones (my term, not his). Amongst other things, he considers Frazer\u0026rsquo;s discussion of the rain dance in that set of \u0026lsquo;Remarks\u0026rsquo;.\nWittgenstein notices that Frazer tries to \u0026rsquo;explain\u0026rsquo; the practice of rain dancing by attributing some sets of beliefs to the people whose practice it is. The attribution of such beliefs, says Wittgenstein, \u0026rsquo;explains\u0026rsquo; human practices only by trivializing them (my words, not his). That is to say, they \u0026rsquo;explain\u0026rsquo; the practice of rain dancing as an expression of some sets of beliefs. He calls such an attempt a \u0026lsquo;sickness\u0026rsquo; (his favorite metaphor). He points out too that this \u0026rsquo;explanation\u0026rsquo; is not satisfactory because it cannot explain why these people perform the rain dance only during the rainy season. (Of course, one can give any number of silly explanations, including the \u0026rsquo;explanation\u0026rsquo; that the performers are \u0026lsquo;conditioned\u0026rsquo; to perform the rain dance during the rainy season. What Wittgenstein was talking about was a non ad hoc explanation.)\nWillem brings out another kind of objection. Willem is not implying that irrigation is unknown to the \u0026rsquo;native American Indians\u0026rsquo; in his analysis of the conversational fragment he cites. He is saying just the opposite. He is saying something like the following: one could suggest that rain dances are performed because the performers need rain water for their crops. (And, of course, they believe that their jumping up and down in some manner will cause the rains to come. This is what Frazer\u0026rsquo;s \u0026rsquo;explanation\u0026rsquo; amounted to.) So, if these people are \u0026rsquo;taught\u0026rsquo; about irrigation, then they will become \u0026lsquo;rational\u0026rsquo; (or \u0026lsquo;scientific\u0026rsquo; as the case may be) and get an insight into the \u0026lsquo;superstitious\u0026rsquo; nature of their practices. Willem is drawing attention to the fact that this argument is wrong. The \u0026lsquo;rain doctor\u0026rsquo; knows about irrigation and says that this has nothing to do with the rain dance. In other words, one should not further \u0026rsquo;explain\u0026rsquo; the rain dance by speaking about the \u0026rsquo;need\u0026rsquo; for rain water either.\nThe general point about the example of the rain dance is this then. Here too is a practice distorted by the kind of explanation that is provided. It is important to understand what is being said and what is not. Neither Wittgenstein nor Willem is arguing that some practice in a culture is beyond criticism just because it is a practice in that culture. They both are saying something like this: make sure that your \u0026rsquo;explanation\u0026rsquo; of a practice does not distort the practice; do not confuse a distorted description of a practice with its \u0026rsquo;explanation\u0026rsquo;.\nIn other words, this rain dance example is a further illustration of the fact that social sciences (in the case of Frazer, the discipline in question is anthropology) are unable to provide knowledge. (This is an illustration, not a \u0026lsquo;proof\u0026rsquo; for the claim.) They seem to think that a distorted description is an \u0026rsquo;explanation\u0026rsquo; and in the process of providing such a description, they transform human practices into \u0026ldquo;pieces of stupidity\u0026rdquo;. Again, this does not mean that there are no \u0026lsquo;stupid\u0026rsquo; practices in human cultures. This is not the issue. The issue is: is it plausible to accept that all the practices of entire cultures are pieces of stupidity? Wittgenstein did not think so: \u0026ldquo;it will never be plausible to say that mankind does all that out of sheer stupidity.\u0026rdquo; I agree with him.\n","tags":["Jeffry Kripal","Paul Courtright","Wendy Doniger","rain dance","Wittgenstein"],"title":"Why Social sciences are not providing knowledge, including the likes of Wendy Doniger and her children?","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/why-social-sciences-are-not-providing-knowledge-including-the-likes-of-wendy-doniger-and-her-children/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","social sciences"],"content":" To begin with, there is the feeling that scientific explanations, with their emphasis on rationality and objectivity, are reductive in nature. Wherein lies the root of this feeling? Let us say that some physical theory describes the motion of a snow flake gently floating down to earth or a rose petal lazily spinning in the air. Or that some branch of human genetics computes the probability of a particular human child being born with absolutely dark eyes or ones that are brilliantly blue. Is either of these two explanations reductive in nature? Not quite: their mathematical calculations tell us very little about the laziness of the petal or about the brilliance of blue eyes, it is true, but it is not their \u0026lsquo;job\u0026rsquo; to do so. If you want to relish descriptions of an autumn evening or a spring morning, you do not open Feynman\u0026rsquo;s Lectures on Physics, do you? You go elsewhere. In other words, the theories in the natural sciences are not \u0026lsquo;reductive\u0026rsquo; in the sense that they do not reduce the beauty of a particular sunset to the motion of earth around the Sun even if they explain sunrise and sunset.\nThe current crop of the so-called social sciences does precisely the above. While ostensibly about human beings, their psychologies, their societies and their cultures, the tales they tell shine forth in the splendor of a monochromatic dullness. (Most of us know something or the other about explanations from these so-called social sciences, so I will not try to give examples.) Why? Here is the first possible reason: they have to give reductive explanations because they are \u0026lsquo;scientific\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;objective\u0026rsquo;. Without \u0026lsquo;reducing\u0026rsquo; human beings into objects, one cannot do science and the existing social sciences merely follow the scientific \u0026lsquo;method\u0026rsquo;. This reason does two things simultaneously: (a) it \u0026rsquo;explains\u0026rsquo; the fate that has befallen the social sciences and humanities; (b) it justifies the poverty of these theories by blaming it on the nature of human beings and the nature of \u0026lsquo;science\u0026rsquo;. We have silly sociological theories and stupid psychological ones, because it is in the nature of human beings to defy being objectified; science cannot work any other way. As I say, this is but one way of looking at the so-called social sciences today. Needless to say, this is the dominant mode as well.\nThere is also another way, my way, of looking at the issue. This is how western culture has been studying human beings, their societies, and their cultures all this while. There is nothing remotely \u0026lsquo;scientific\u0026rsquo; about either this venture or its results. The justification they provide (see 2b above) is an expression of an empty pretentiousness: because \u0026lsquo;we\u0026rsquo; have not been able to study human societies and cultures differently, the intellectuals from the western culture pontificate, no one else can. The limits of our culture are also the epistemological limits of human beings. Surely, they say, if we have not succeeded, that is because no one can! Why do I say that this is the way of the \u0026lsquo;western culture\u0026rsquo;? What has this culture to do with the monochromatic formalism I spoke of earlier?\nWhen Christianity met (or meets) other \u0026lsquo;religions\u0026rsquo; (especially \u0026rsquo;the heathen religions\u0026rsquo; like \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;Buddhism\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;Sikhism\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;Jainism\u0026rsquo; and so on), there is only one way it can describe them: these \u0026lsquo;religions\u0026rsquo; do not worship \u0026lsquo;God\u0026rsquo; but the \u0026lsquo;Devil\u0026rsquo;. We are the heathens and the pagans, and the differences (subtle or gross), if any, between these religions are at best those that exist within the heathen religions. Of course, there are \u0026lsquo;rays of light\u0026rsquo; to be found in the heathen religions too: but that is accounted for by the fact that these religions are the corruptions and degenerations of the \u0026lsquo;primal\u0026rsquo; religion that God (of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob) gave to Man. (The same story is told by Judaism and Islam as well, but I will not talk about either of them now.) Over the last two thousand years, Christianity has worked out immensely sophisticated notions of Man, society, and so on. These notions have become a part of our daily language-use: whether you speak English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, or whichever other European language. That is not all.\nThese Christian ideas about Man and his psychology, society and culture, have become the presuppositions for what we call \u0026lsquo;social sciences\u0026rsquo; and the \u0026lsquo;humanities\u0026rsquo; today. (In my book, I describe this process which I call the \u0026lsquo;secularization\u0026rsquo; of Christianity in detail.) They are so deep and so pervasive within the western culture that they set limits to the western imagination itself: it is not simply possible for this culture even to imagine that other ways of thinking and going-about the world are possible. The so-called social sciences today, endlessly embroider this theology: all peoples and cultures (except themselves) are heathens. If this is all they tell, it is, one must admit, pretty boring. Indeed so: everyone and everything (excepting the western culture) are the same, and the most \u0026lsquo;interesting\u0026rsquo; things are to be found in the western culture. Whether you speak of politics (from \u0026lsquo;dictatorships\u0026rsquo; to \u0026lsquo;democracy\u0026rsquo;), knowledge (\u0026lsquo;science\u0026rsquo;), settling human disputes (\u0026lsquo;Law\u0026rsquo;), welfare of people (from \u0026lsquo;slavery\u0026rsquo; to \u0026lsquo;capitalism\u0026rsquo;), or whatever takes your fancy, it transpires that the western culture has them all. What they do not have at the moment, they say, is what they have lost (i.e. had them \u0026lsquo;once\u0026rsquo;). All other cultures end up becoming pale or erring variants of the western culture, in exactly the same way our \u0026lsquo;religions\u0026rsquo; are pale and erring variants of Christianity.\nOf course, it does not stop there. Why has the western culture reduced the other cultures to a pale and erring variant of itself? That is because, it is so: it is epistemologically impossible that human cultures are different in any way other than how the western culture has described them! It calls this reduction \u0026lsquo;science\u0026rsquo;: \u0026lsquo;objective\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;value free\u0026rsquo;, and what not. Philosophers and social scientists endlessly assure us that it cannot be any other way. This is not \u0026lsquo;science\u0026rsquo; but bad, baaaaad Christian theology. It has become \u0026lsquo;secularized\u0026rsquo;, become established in the universities with professorial chairs, grants, and doctorates and what-have-you, but it remains as dully monochromatic as its religious original: Who is Ganesha? The minion of the Devil. Who is Saraswathi? The minion of the Devil. Who is Krishna? The minion of the Devil. Who is Sharada? The minion of the Devil. What do we do? We worship idols, whether made of stone or clay. We are mentally deficient: that is the reason why we worship cycles, cars, the pen (Aayudhapuja), the cow and the crow, the naked fakir and the stone penis. Not only are the Indians guilty as charged: all heathen cultures are that as well. The Egyptians, the Mayans, the Africans, the Thais, the Japanese … The list extends to all cultures and all peoples who are not Jewish and Muslim. (These two are \u0026lsquo;deficient\u0026rsquo; in their worship; they might be heretics but not heathens.) If this is the litany, you can have only one reaction: Ho Hum! (A huge Yawn!)\nThe \u0026lsquo;varieties\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;differences\u0026rsquo; in human cultures get reduced to the same: they are all versions of worshipping the Devil. The so-called social sciences are on this track. This is not a simple expression of racism, western superiority or Orientalism (even if they are all that). Rather, it has to do with what western culture is, what its \u0026lsquo;social sciences\u0026rsquo; are, and what the relation is between these two and the religion that Christianity is.\nIn other words, this is how I \u0026rsquo;explain\u0026rsquo; the reduction that the co-called social sciences indulge in: the reduction occurs not because they are objective and scientific explanations, but because they are secularized theological claims. Until recently, I was in the strict minority of one in the republic of \u0026rsquo;learning\u0026rsquo; but I do not believe that you need to win two-thirds of the vote to decide about the truth or falsity of scientific theories. So I soldier on, certain that I have good arguments and an exciting research programme; where possible, I try to show that my story is more interesting than any other that exists in the market-place. In the long run, I know that this story will win out; until such stage, there are the words: \u0026ldquo;Karmanyeevadhikaaraste, Maa Phaleshu Kadaachana\u0026rdquo;.\nFrom all of these, it follows that I am not trying to compare our culture with the western one any more than I want to compare, say, \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo; with Christianity. But what I do want to do is to understand both: our culture and the western one, our traditions and the western Christianity. It is not enough, if it is a \u0026rsquo;true\u0026rsquo; understanding that I merely think I am right. You and the others must not only understand what I say, but you must also be sure that it is not merely my personal prejudices that get bundled together as an \u0026rsquo;explanation\u0026rsquo;. In other words, you should be able to \u0026rsquo;test\u0026rsquo; my theory in any number of ways: from checking it against your own experiences to drawing conclusions from my arguments that I am not even aware. That is what knowledge and objectivity all about: am I ranting and raving, or am I saying something worth thinking about and exploring further?\nAs an unrepentant heathen, I do not believe in the truth claims of Christianity that it is \u0026rsquo;the true\u0026rsquo; religion. As a member of the Indian culture, I do believe that alternative (more realistic, more factual and more productive) heuristics exist in our culture that will help human cultures to understand each other. As an intellectual, I believe that developing them is my priority. As a scientist, I believe that if what I say is knowledge, it will also be like what scientific knowledge is: tentative, hypothetical, and \u0026rsquo;testable\u0026rsquo; (in a broad sense). And, finally, as a human being, I do not believe that knowledge reduces the complexity of the world but teaches us instead to truly appreciate how marvelous we and our worlds, both natural and cultural, really are.\n","tags":[],"title":"Reductive explanations in social sciences – S.N.

I do not identify Wendy\u0026rsquo;s statement as an \u0026lsquo;ad hoc\u0026rsquo; explanation. I say that it trivializes what I am doing by providing a distorted description of what I do. Here is what I say: \u0026ldquo;I am doing Puja to Shiva.\u0026rdquo; No discussion about \u0026lsquo;Lingam\u0026rsquo; or its many meanings. This is a wrong way of conducting a discussion. She cannot, therefore, argue that I am giving an \u0026lsquo;ad hoc\u0026rsquo; explanation because I am not giving an \u0026rsquo;explanation\u0026rsquo; of what I am doing but merely describing it.\nLet us sketch some scenarios in order to see what conversational moves are there in such a discussion.\n**(**1) She sees me doing \u0026lsquo;something\u0026rsquo; and asks me what I am doing.\n(2) I say I am doing Puja to Shiva. From here on, two possible threads of discussion open up. The first thread goes like this.\n(3) Either she asks \u0026lsquo;why\u0026rsquo; I do it: I say, it is our tradition, or that I am a Bhakta of Shiva, or because my mother said I should, or whatever else happens to be the case. Or she asks me why Shiva has the form he has: either I tell her the story from the Puranas, or provide her a \u0026lsquo;sthala purana\u0026rsquo; (i.e. a story about that particular temple) or I say, \u0026rsquo;this is how we do it\u0026rsquo;.\n(4) Let us say, she pursues the story from the Puranas and asks me \u0026lsquo;So, you are worshipping the Lingam of Shiva\u0026rsquo;. I say, \u0026lsquo;yes, indeed, this is Shiva Lingam\u0026rsquo;.\n(5) Being persistent, she goes further: \u0026lsquo;do you know what \u0026lsquo;Lingam\u0026rsquo; means?\u0026rsquo; and I reply \u0026lsquo;well, yes, I do know some of its meanings as we use it in our language\u0026rsquo;.\n(6) Suppose she isolates one meaning, say, phallus and asks me: \u0026lsquo;So, you say you are worshipping Shiva\u0026rsquo;s Lingam\u0026rsquo;. I reply, unperturbed, \u0026lsquo;yes, but I said so already: this is Shiva\u0026rsquo;s Lingam. That is why we call it Shivalingam and not, say, KuberaLingam\u0026rsquo;. In this thread, where I am using Indian words, she cannot even come close to saying what she wants to.\nSuppose at step three, we switch to speaking in English.\n(3\u0026rsquo;) She asks what \u0026lsquo;puja\u0026rsquo; is and what \u0026rsquo;lingam\u0026rsquo; means. Here is what I would say today: \u0026ldquo;\u0026lsquo;Puja\u0026rsquo; is best understood as a ritual; as far as \u0026lsquo;Lingam\u0026rsquo; is concerned, I suggest you see it as \u0026rsquo;the form\u0026rsquo; in which this ritual is performed to Shiva\u0026rdquo;. Again here, two possible threads open up: the first where she \u0026lsquo;contests\u0026rsquo; my translation and the other where she accepts it.\nLet us pursue the second thread to begin with.\n(4\u0026rsquo;) \u0026lsquo;Why has Shiva taken this form?\u0026rsquo; Because I am not trying to be polemical, I tell her our stories from the Puranas and say it is one of the stories from our tradition. And I add, \u0026rsquo;to perform puja to Shiva means to perform the ritual to this form\u0026rsquo;. Because my description has the form of a definition (Shiva puja=ritual to this form) no sensible discussion about it is possible.\n(5\u0026rsquo;) She can come up with another definition, but then, I say \u0026lsquo;yes, but that is not my definition\u0026rsquo; and the discussion is over. On this thread, where we are discussing in English, she cannot say what she wants to either.\nLet us now suppose she contests my translation given in step (3\u0026rsquo;). How is she going to do it?\n(4\u0026rsquo;) \u0026ldquo;But you are wrong. \u0026lsquo;Puja\u0026rsquo; is \u0026lsquo;worship\u0026rsquo; and \u0026rsquo;lingam\u0026rsquo; means \u0026lsquo;penis\u0026rsquo;. Therefore, you are \u0026lsquo;worshipping a penis when you say that you are doing puja to the Shiva Lingam\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;. Here is what I would say today: \u0026ldquo;You see, the English word \u0026lsquo;worship\u0026rsquo; comes basically from Christian theology where one worships either the God or the Devil and nothing else. Under no interpretation of such a theology could one consider Shiva as \u0026lsquo;God\u0026rsquo;, leaving us with only one possibility that Shiva is either the Devil or his minion. Is this what you want say: that we are worshipping Devil or his minions? In that case, Wendy, we are not discussing a translation issue but a Christian theological one.\u0026rdquo; Again, two threads open up: either she denies it or asks for further explication. Let us take up her denial first.\n(5\u0026rsquo;) \u0026ldquo;No, that is not what \u0026lsquo;worship\u0026rsquo; means. It means \u0026lsquo;reverence\u0026rsquo;. I am not a Christian, I was born a Jew; I know nothing of Christian theology even though I was married to one for some time.\u0026rdquo; I would say the following today: \u0026ldquo;Wendy, I would be willing to accept your definition of \u0026lsquo;worship\u0026rsquo;. But if I do so, I must do violence to other people and cultures: the Jewish, the Christian and the Muslim. From your definition, it would follow that they are not \u0026lsquo;worshipping\u0026rsquo; God at all! And further, they cannot. In all these cultures, one can show \u0026lsquo;reverence\u0026rsquo; to the elderly, the king, knowledge, the powerful, etc. To say that they show \u0026lsquo;reverence\u0026rsquo; to God in the same way is to transform all of them into \u0026lsquo;idolaters\u0026rsquo;, which, according to their theologies, is the greatest sin! I am sorry, but your translation of \u0026lsquo;puja\u0026rsquo; is not a mere linguistic issue.\u0026rdquo; Again, the discussion shifts to another level. She cannot pursue this line of enquiry either.\nLet us say she asks for explication, the other thread in step (4\u0026rsquo;). How can the discussion proceed?\n(5\u0026quot;) Here let me bend the stick in favour of Wendy. \u0026ldquo;But every Sanskrit-English dictionary, and every Indian teacher in Sanskrit who knows English, translates \u0026lsquo;puja\u0026rsquo; as \u0026lsquo;worship\u0026rsquo;. Are you saying their knowledge of either languages is deficient and you are the only one who knows how to translate \u0026lsquo;Puja\u0026rsquo; correctly?\u0026rdquo; Being a reasonable person, I would not get offended by her rhetorical attempts to make me appear ridiculous. I would say the following: \u0026ldquo;You see, Wendy, we all learnt English through Indian languages and were taught that \u0026lsquo;Puja\u0026rsquo; means \u0026lsquo;worship\u0026rsquo;. We give the meaning of \u0026lsquo;Puja\u0026rsquo; to the English word \u0026lsquo;worship\u0026rsquo;. The first generations of translators \u0026lsquo;decided\u0026rsquo; to translate \u0026lsquo;puja\u0026rsquo; as \u0026lsquo;worship\u0026rsquo; because they were convinced that we are \u0026lsquo;idolaters\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;worshipped\u0026rsquo; the Devil and his minions. So, you see, we have to discuss the historical issues involving colonialism and what it means to a culture like ours in order to satisfactorily resolve the issues of translation. That is all I am saying. Shall we do so? Have your read \u0026lsquo;The Heathen in his blindness: Asia, the West and the dynamic of religion\u0026rsquo;?\u0026rdquo;\nThus I can go on sketching several other scenarios of the possible conversational moves open to Wendy in conducting such a conversation. In none of them can she induce the cognitive wrongness that was induced in me when I was a boy of 14. She simply does not have the cognitive ability to come up with an explanation that can trivialize my experience any more. Let me just pen a few reflections about this state of affairs, because it is very important to realize what has happened consistently throughout these conversations.\n(A) The first thing to notice is that, in all these scenarios, I am defining the terms of the debate. She is unable to do this with respect to what I am doing.\n(B) I am able to do it because I am knowledgeable about the western culture. That is, I am not ignorant of the western culture the way I was when I was 14 or 24. Therefore, I am able to tell her that she does not understand her own culture as well as I understand hers.\n(C) My principle of charity forbids me from transforming any culture, whether hers or mine, into a bunch of idiots. My conversational move in (5\u0026rsquo;) makes me defend the Jewish, Islamic, and Christian cultures because of this principle. Of course, the same principle makes me defend Indian traditions as \u0026lsquo;reasonable\u0026rsquo; ones too.\n(D) I am not making use of any fancy defensive \u0026rsquo;explanation\u0026rsquo; - some or another kind of \u0026lsquo;symbolic\u0026rsquo; explanation - (or even any \u0026rsquo;explanation\u0026rsquo;) that many Indians come up with to defend their own traditions. Such \u0026rsquo;explanations\u0026rsquo; arise out of ignorance: both of their own traditions and, above all, of the western culture. They have very little understanding of the subjects they talk about, but the \u0026lsquo;conviction\u0026rsquo; they know what is there to know is matched by none. Most English-speaking Indian intellectuals are a pompous and empty lot: they talk and argue for the sake of doing so, and believe that \u0026lsquo;knowledge\u0026rsquo; is a matter of providing citations and references to books. (I will be writing the article I promised you, as an answer to your question, where I will take up this issue in some detail.) But they have no depth of understanding regarding either their own traditions or those of the West. They are like the JNU \u0026lsquo;intellectuals\u0026rsquo;: empty, sanctimonious, convinced of their own intelligence, but full of hot air.\n(E) To understand my mother, I needed to understand my mother-in-law. What you see in my imaginary conversation with Wendy is an exemplification of this realization. There will be no Indian Renaissance without breeding a new set of intellectuals. The current lot is not even worth the paper on which they write and produce so much nonsense. This might sound a harsh judgment. Undoubtedly, there are some fine individuals among them; I know a few of them personally myself. But this is how I look at the issue.\n","tags":["Wendy Doniger"],"title":"Denying Experience: Do Hindus ‘worship’?

However, I will eschew making some kinds of qualifications academics are prone to make, so that any intelligent, but layperson can not only follow the discussion but also evaluate what is being said.\n(B)I do not subscribe to the \u0026lsquo;identity politics\u0026rsquo; popular in the US universities, any more than I belong to the community of writers who call themselves \u0026lsquo;post-colonial\u0026rsquo; or as defenders of the \u0026lsquo;sub-altern\u0026rsquo; studies. I find such writings intellectually both puerile and pernicious.\n(C) In no form or fashion do I want to claim that the location of a person is relevant to evaluating what he says. Caste, creed, ethnic origins, cultural location, skin-colour, passport, etc. are no more relevant to this debate than the fact that the \u0026lsquo;Jewishness\u0026rsquo; of Albert Einstein is relevant to evaluating his theory of general (or special) relativity. That is to say, if we can do physics, Mathematics, Biology, etc.; if we can write in illuminating ways about St. Augustine or Martin Luther; I do not see why someone from another culture (whether Western, African, or American Indian) cannot do the same about Shankaracharya or Ramakrishna Paramahamsa.\n(D)The above stance is not a mere moral one, as far as I am concerned. This is an integral part of what it is to contribute to human knowledge. In so far as possessing a white skin does not make one into a scientific researcher only by virtue of this fact alone, the same does not disqualify one from being a researcher either. It is strictly irrelevant. However, this does not mean that it is irrelevant to producing that knowledge. In more ways than one, one\u0026rsquo;s context is important and, perhaps, in this column I can talk about the ways in which it is the case. But this concerns the production of knowledge not its evaluation.\nTherefore, I will be interrogating Jeffrey Kripal with respect to one single question: has he produced knowledge or not? I do not believe he has; I believe his stance prevents him from recognizing it; I do not believe he knows either of these two. I will try to provide arguments in defense of these charges. This is my brief.\nDear Jeffrey Kripal,\nMany voices will have joined in this debate by the time I get to publish this. Mine is one such. In the course of the communication, it is possible that I raise my voice now and then to make some point or another. Let this only draw your attention to the fact that we are disputing some issues not as disembodied minds but as human beings. Menschliches, Allzumenschliches (Human, All-too-Human), as Nietzsche put it so beautifully while titling one of his contributions thus.\nYour first book raises many issues; your other book even more. As does Rajiv Malhotra\u0026rsquo;s article. So does your response. I want to take up many of them; but my \u0026lsquo;wordiness\u0026rsquo; (as some people so kindly characterize my style) will no doubt prevent me from doing all I want to. But the issue I want to tackle requires this writing style. So, please indulge me. In order to set the problem up, I will begin by sketching some relevant anecdotes.\nAs is the case with most Indians, I learnt English through an Indian language. I was taught that puja was worship, devas meant \u0026lsquo;gods\u0026rsquo; (with this capitalisation) and so on. It was not clear what exactly \u0026lsquo;God\u0026rsquo; was even though I was taught that you write \u0026lsquo;God\u0026rsquo; with a \u0026lsquo;big G\u0026rsquo; as we used to say. I guess I assumed that \u0026lsquo;God\u0026rsquo; referred to the entity you \u0026lsquo;chose\u0026rsquo;: mine, for instance was \u0026lsquo;Ishwara\u0026rsquo;. Somehow, I fell in love with this \u0026rsquo;erotic ascetic\u0026rsquo; (as Wendy Doniger titled her book on Shiva): with his abode in the \u0026lsquo;cemeteries\u0026rsquo;, with his tendency to be easily provoked to anger; his \u0026lsquo;veebhoothi\u0026rsquo; and his snake and, of course, his children Ganesha and Skanda. No doubt, it has something to do with my name and my \u0026lsquo;short temper\u0026rsquo; (as we say in India) too. One day, I must have been around 14 then, I \u0026lsquo;discovered\u0026rsquo; that Linga meant phallus (a \u0026lsquo;penis\u0026rsquo; as it was explained to me) and that it was a \u0026lsquo;symbol\u0026rsquo; of male fertility. So, when my sisters and mother went to do puja in the nearby temple of Mallikarjuna (another name for Shiva), they actually went to worship a male penis. I was terribly, terribly embarrassed by this explanation, felt it was wrong too, but did not know what to say about it. I still remember running to the temple to see whether the Shiva linga looked like a penis. I must confess that it did not. However, my insistence on this fact generated a jeering laughter from the person who had \u0026lsquo;broken this news\u0026rsquo; to me: \u0026ldquo;How many have you seen? That is what the penis will look like when you grow old.\u0026rdquo; My sense of wrongness persisted, the embarrassment never left me, especially when Europeans asked me what \u0026lsquo;Shiva linga\u0026rsquo; stood for. But I did not know what to say.\nFast forward. Nearly a decade later. I am 24 and on my first trip to Europe. I \u0026lsquo;knew\u0026rsquo; about homosexuality abstractly (i.e. it never occurred to me to visualise it concretely), and had \u0026rsquo;no problems with it\u0026rsquo; (as I used to put it in those days). However, I was quite unprepared for the sight of males \u0026lsquo;French kissing\u0026rsquo; each other openly and therefore was incredulously fascinated by the scene when I first came across it in Amsterdam. Anyway, I went back to India having learnt about some of the outward signs of manifesting homosexual affection.\nAs you will no doubt know, it is a common practice for friends to walk the streets in India, holding hands and moving them breezily. It is equally common to put your arm across the shoulders of your friend and walk or cycle. In India, I had a friend who had this habit of clasping your hands and walk along with you. After my return from Europe, I could not reciprocate any more: I knew what it \u0026lsquo;meant\u0026rsquo;. Even though I had no problem doing the same before I went to Europe, after my return, I could not. It was embarrassing; but I could not share this feeling with my friend who had never been to Europe. I could not tell him to stop doing it either because it would have affected our friendship. So, I tried not to walk next to him when we were together in a group. When two of us were alone and on the streets, I solved \u0026rsquo;the problem\u0026rsquo; by constantly holding a lighted cigarette in the hand he would want to clasp. Instinctively, as it happened many-a-times, he would move to the other side; then, so would my cigarette.\nFast forward again. Nearly a quarter century later. Today, I am able to reflect about what embarrassments like the above signified. Now I have begun to fashion the intellectual and conceptual tools needed to interrogate these experiences: not mine alone but those of a culture. What was the nature of wrongness and embarrassment I felt when I \u0026lsquo;discovered\u0026rsquo; that linga \u0026lsquo;meant\u0026rsquo; penis? Why did I feel embarrassed to hold my friend\u0026rsquo;s hand? What sense of \u0026lsquo;wrongness\u0026rsquo; prevented me from telling him what \u0026rsquo;embarrassed\u0026rsquo; me about this simple act of affection between friends? And so on and so forth.\nMany readers of the debate that has ensued after Rajiv Malhotra\u0026rsquo;s article are expressing this sense of \u0026lsquo;wrongness\u0026rsquo; as well. Probably, most of them do not belong to the \u0026lsquo;Hindu right\u0026rsquo; or to the \u0026lsquo;Hindutva\u0026rsquo; movement. Nor are they expressing an ironed out, prudish \u0026rsquo;neo-Vedantic\u0026rsquo; strain, as you put it. Something else is involved. Before interrogating this experience, let me tell you what happened recently. I asked my brother (in India) to read the Sulekha column and tell me of his responses. Unprepared for what he was going to encounter, he had the article and the responses printed out and read them through. The other day, I rang up to ask him what he made of all this. He told me that he could not sleep the whole night after reading Rajiv Malhotra\u0026rsquo;s article. He just sat the night through he said, much to his wife\u0026rsquo;s worry who told him that he was \u0026lsquo;foolish\u0026rsquo; to read all kinds of stuff and upset himself. \u0026ldquo;Why do they write about us like this,\u0026rdquo; he asked, \u0026ldquo;what injustice (Anyaaya) have we done to the Americans that they write about our deva\u0026rsquo;s this way?\u0026rdquo; He feels enraged, ashamed, humiliated and wounded, without knowing what to do about any of these feelings. \u0026ldquo;I feel like scratching my body incessantly\u0026rdquo; (a typical Indian expression of helplessness), he said, \u0026ldquo;they \u0026lsquo;should not\u0026rsquo; have written this way. It is wrong. It is a paapa\u0026rdquo; (Ganesha is his favorite \u0026lsquo;God\u0026rsquo;. His home is full of pictures of all kinds of Ganesha\u0026rsquo;s: the baby Ganseha, the crawling Ganesha, the dancing Ganesha and, of course, any number of seated ones.) Why do my brother and many others like him on this board experience feelings like \u0026lsquo;injustice\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;humiliation\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;moral wrong\u0026rsquo; and so on? If they are \u0026lsquo;shocked\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;indignant\u0026rsquo;, which they undoubtedly are, what kind of a shock and indignation is it?\nSurely, Jeffrey Kripal, this is the first thing you have to explore when you want to \u0026lsquo;understand\u0026rsquo; a culture different from your own. You say, in your defense, that you have assembled a thick file of correspondence (both positive and negative) from Indians and that you are \u0026lsquo;sensitive\u0026rsquo; to their feelings. This is not an issue about your sensitivity or mine, my friend, but about cultural sensibilities. What kind of shock and sense of wrongness does one feel to see Ramakrishna portrayed as a sort of pedophile? (Of course, you do not quite \u0026lsquo;say\u0026rsquo; it in these terms; we will have time to look at your nuances later.) You have the answers ready: I know them, so do the readers. Instead of discussing them in the abstract, let us try and interrogate these experiences themselves, and do an exercise in \u0026lsquo;cultural hermeneutics\u0026rsquo; as it were.\nHere is the first striking thing: these purported \u0026rsquo;explanations\u0026rsquo; trivialize experiences. When I \u0026lsquo;found out\u0026rsquo; that my mother, my sisters, all women and all men, were merely worshipping the male penis it told me the following: (a) that what I was doing was, in fact, \u0026lsquo;worshipping\u0026rsquo; the penis; (b) that I was a \u0026lsquo;fool\u0026rsquo; to think that I was doing something else other than this. That is to say, not only did it make all hitherto acts of worship look foolish, it also insisted that I was being doubly \u0026lsquo;foolish\u0026rsquo; for not knowing this.\nBy virtue of this, it \u0026rsquo;transformed\u0026rsquo; my experience. What does the transformation consist of? Such purported explanations re-describe experiences by twisting or distorting them. Before I went to Europe, holding hands was not experienced by me as an expression of homosexuality but now it gets distorted to become one after my encounter with the European culture. Same thing with respect to the re-description of linga as penis.\nOf course, it is the case that scientific theories \u0026lsquo;correct\u0026rsquo; experiences too: we see a stick appearing bent when immersed in water and see the movement of the sun across the horizon. Our scientific theories tell us that neither is true. In such cases, it is important to note that these theories preserve our experiences the way they are: in fact, the scientific theories explain to us the necessity of such appearances. They do not distort them, much less deny them.\nThat is what these purported explanations do: deny our experiences. Our worship of the linga is in reality not a worship of Shiva at all, but a \u0026lsquo;subconscious acknowledgement\u0026rsquo; of some \u0026lsquo;repressed\u0026rsquo; notion of fertility (or whatever else). Whatever we \u0026rsquo;experience\u0026rsquo; is not the said object at all but something else.\nWhat happens when your experience is denied by being distorted and trivialized? If you \u0026lsquo;accept\u0026rsquo; this story of penis, both erect and limp, can you feel the same sense of \u0026lsquo;reverence\u0026rsquo; (or call it what you want) that you did once, remember it too, without feeling a perfect ass? You cannot. You cannot have access to such an experience any more. That is, these purported explanations deny access to our own experiences.\nHere lies the root of the sense of \u0026lsquo;wrongness\u0026rsquo; that my brother and many others feel. Who or what is denying access to our own experience? It is not a theory, but a theorizing of someone else\u0026rsquo;s experience. Because this point can be easily misunderstood, let me unravel this just a bit.\nMuch before Freud wrote whatever he did, we had people from other religions coming to India to say the same thing: first from Islam and then from Christianity. They told us (not only them, many Indians in their wake told us that as well!) that we were worshipping the cow, the monkey, the penis, the stone idol and the naked fakir. This is how these people experienced us and our activities. Their theologies had prepared them for such an experience much before they came to our part of the world. Of course, they \u0026lsquo;saw\u0026rsquo; only what they expected to see.\nThe descriptions the missionaries provided, the reports of Christian merchants, the interpretations of the Muslim kings, the developments within Christian theology, etc. were the \u0026lsquo;facts\u0026rsquo; that Freud sought to understand. (To the extent he believed that he was laying the foundation of a \u0026lsquo;scientific\u0026rsquo; theory, to that extent these were the \u0026lsquo;facts\u0026rsquo; he was accounting for.) What did he \u0026rsquo;theorize\u0026rsquo; then? He theorized upon the European experience of other cultures and upon a theological elaboration of these experiences.\nConsequently, who or what is denying the access to our experience? The experience of another culture. (Or, the \u0026rsquo;theorizing of such an experience.\u0026rsquo; Though important in its own right, we can safely drop this distinction. Taking it into consideration would make the analysis complex without adding anything of substance.) This lies at the root of the feeling of wrongness: our experiences are being trivialized, denied, distorted and made inaccessible by someone else\u0026rsquo;s experience of the world. Hence the feeling of moral or ethical wrongness, because such a situation is neither justified nor justifiable. One is made to think that, apparently, there is only one way of experiencing the world: the \u0026lsquo;western way\u0026rsquo;.\nThus some among us protest: this situation is morally wrong. \u0026ldquo;What injustice have we done that you speak of us this way? It is a paapa\u0026rdquo;, as my brother put it. Like Rajiv Malhotra, there are others who argue this point of view eloquently and with repeated insistence. But such men and women are easily branded: as the RSS, as the Hindutva and, of course, the ever-present threat of being damned as a \u0026lsquo;Hindu fundamentalist\u0026rsquo;. Others, much like the 14-year-old boy that I once was, fall silent because another kind of wrongness is involved as well: the cognitive wrongness.\nScientific theories, in so far as they explain our experiences, do so without denying or trivializing the latter. But the explanations of the sort you give, and those I heard, do not explain; they merely trivialize, distort and deny what we experience. They do not shed any light on our experiences, but render them opaque and inaccessible. Galileo did not deny that we see the movement of the sun on the horizon or that we see it rise and set. None would have taken him seriously, then or later, if he had done either. Instead, he explained the necessity of this perception, while explaining that the world is not structured this way. To be sure he challenged; but to whom or to what did he address it to? To a set of beliefs about the world and to the authority that defended those beliefs. He did not tell you or me that we hallucinate every time we see the movement of the Sun; he claimed that the geocentric theory was false. This is not what you are doing, Jeffey Kripal. You are telling us we have a false experience and not that we have a false theory about mysticism. How do you accomplish this? By trivializing and denying our experience. And this makes most of us fall silent, making us dumb. The way a boy of 14 could not think of anything to say when he heard that the Shiva linga was the male penis. Not because it struck a chord in him, but because he did not know how to counter it. He fell silent because he did not know how to express the sense of cognitive wrongness he felt, a situation that many among of us find ourselves in.\nToday, more than three decades later, that boy has grown up. He has studied books, thought about questions and analyzed the relevant experiences. Today, he is able to say what is cognitively wrong: such explanations do the opposite of what scientific theories do. He now knows that these \u0026rsquo;explanations\u0026rsquo; do nothing of the sort they claim; they are merely a way of structuring the experience of a people from another culture. He knows that these pseudo-explanations, that is what they are, sound fancy; knows too that many from his culture parrot this exotic product. But since when, he asks himself, are scientific truths decided by means of majority votes? Thus he claims that the first charge is true Jeffrey Kripal: your story is wrong not only morally but also cognitively. That is, you have not produced knowledge. You could not have produced it because you have not \u0026rsquo;explained\u0026rsquo; the experience but, instead, provided a trivialized and distorted description of such an experience. You are not even close to capturing (let alone explaining) the Indian \u0026lsquo;mysticism\u0026rsquo; or its cultural forms. In fact, he says, you are blind even to seeing it.\nWhat an extraordinary thing to say! You have written a book about the mysticism of Ramakrishna and, yet, here I am, suggesting that you are not even able to see it. So, a bit of explanation is in order. It is tricky, so let us take it by stages. 13.1. Let us step back from the psychoanalytical explanations and ask ourselves the following question: which problem was Freud trying to solve? Of course, there were many: he wanted to investigate into the nature of \u0026lsquo;hysteria\u0026rsquo;; he wanted to figure out the story behind incest fantasies; he wanted to understand the slips of the tongue, etc. I do not mean any of these. What is the underlying problem behind these issues? Philosophers of science identify such problems as the \u0026lsquo;problem-situation\u0026rsquo;. What then was Freud\u0026rsquo;s problem-situation? Both the nature of the psychoanalytic practice and the structure (and content) of the psychoanalytical explanations give us ample clues in the direction of an answer. In its blandest form, it is this: \u0026ldquo;Is one\u0026rsquo;s experience in the world (especially about oneself and the others) veridical (i.e. true)?\u0026rdquo; If we keep in mind what I have said hitherto and what you implicitly assume, it can be put even more provocatively: Is the experience of an individual directly accessible to the individual whose experience it is?\n13.2. Freud\u0026rsquo;s answer is known: no, he said, one can access one\u0026rsquo;s own experience only through the mediation of another, in casu, the psychoanalyst. This is not the only reason why Freud\u0026rsquo;s story appears unbelievable. There is something else of importance as well.\nI am sure you will admit that not only the notion of experience but also its existence is of crucial importance to us human beings. We think that experience is valuable and important; it is both the source of and the precondition for most learning. Given its centrality to human existence, one would naturally expect the western tradition to be bothered about figuring out what this \u0026rsquo;experience\u0026rsquo; is all about. Yet, amazingly enough as it turns out, such is not the case. Despite books and articles in many, many disciplines bearing the title, the nature of \u0026rsquo;experience\u0026rsquo; is hardly studied. More often than not, it is reduced to thoughts, feelings, perception (or even sensation) and action. None of these, either severally or jointly exhausts experience because one could experience any or all of them as well. (One can experience thoughts, feelings, etc.) Thus, what is \u0026rsquo;experience\u0026rsquo;? An important question, but very ill understood.\nSuch being the case, Freud\u0026rsquo;s observation and his sensing of the \u0026lsquo;problem-situation\u0026rsquo; is very sensitive indeed. Of course, he hypothesized that the individual experience is not directly accessible to the said individual, and postulated many mechanisms to account for this non-accessibility. We need take no sides on the \u0026lsquo;validity\u0026rsquo; or otherwise of his individual hypotheses here, even though I will return to this issue in another way at the end of this column.\n13.3. There is, however, another culture in the world, which has made this \u0026lsquo;problem-situation\u0026rsquo; an absolutely central focus of its enquiry. All the Indian traditions, without any major exception as far as I know, have made experience and its interrogation central to their enquiry. Naturally, they too discovered that experience is not \u0026lsquo;veridical\u0026rsquo;; there are \u0026rsquo;things\u0026rsquo; that prevent us from accessing these experiences. Different traditions called them differently: Maaya, Avidya and Agyana, are the best-known categories in this context. They thought each of these categories was an instance of \u0026lsquo;paapa\u0026rsquo; and, in fact, removing this has been their central goal: Gyaanoodaya or the \u0026lsquo;arising of knowledge\u0026rsquo; (again, it is called differently by different traditions). The hindrances to knowledge were either \u0026lsquo;illusions\u0026rsquo; (of sorts) or ignorance (of sorts). One could eliminate them, they said, and developed any number of practical ways of doing so. (The plurality of the Indian traditions is partly a plurality of the ways of removing the veil of ignorance.)\nThough ill understood by most Indologists and philosophers, these notions are crucial. \u0026lsquo;Ignorance\u0026rsquo; is not mere \u0026lsquo;absence of information\u0026rsquo;; it is accorded a positive role, and seen as a positive force that actively hinders the emergence of knowledge. Maaya is not mere illusion; the world exists and impinges upon us too much to make the facile claim of the sort that Patrick Hogan makes in his article on Sulekha. In any case, these traditions believed too that some kind of \u0026lsquo;mediation\u0026rsquo; would be helpful in accessing one\u0026rsquo;s own experience. They called such a mediator \u0026lsquo;Guru\u0026rsquo; and suggested that, in most cases, one needed a Guru to achieve \u0026rsquo;enlightenment\u0026rsquo;.\n13.4. In other words, Jeffrey Kripal, there exist two rival or competing practical traditions that address themselves to the same (or very, very similar) problem-situation. By virtue of this, they become rival or competing research traditions that provide different answers to the same problem-situation.\n13.5. Why did you not look at the Indian traditions this way to understand Kali\u0026rsquo;s Child? The Indian traditions challenge Freud\u0026rsquo;s theories. Why did you not look at the issue in this manner?\nIt is not as though you are ignorant of the Indian traditions. Even if you are, your mentor Wendy Doniger is supposed to be the expert on \u0026lsquo;Hinduism\u0026rsquo;. Why did it not occur either to her or to you that the theories you used were already facing challenges from within the Indian traditions? Here is my simple answer: you have been blinded to the existence of Indian traditions as alternatives to Freud.\n13.6. This is not all. You do something more in your blindness. You use Freudian explanation to characterize a rival research tradition. Such a move can only yield a caricatured, distorted version of the competitor. When I was young, I remember one of my uncles making fun of my exposition of the Darwinian evolutionary theory with the following riposte: \u0026ldquo;You might be proud to accept that your ancestors are monkeys. I, however, am not.\u0026rdquo; I felt like a fool again, because I did not know how to respond to my uncle. As I read the research and the controversies later, I discovered that this is one of the most standard ways of ridiculing the evolutionary theory. Who does the ridiculing? Those who belong to the rival research traditions, of course! By caricaturing Galileo\u0026rsquo;s theory, Aristotelians ridiculed it; this is how modern medicine looks at Paracelsus or the medical practices in the Europe of the Middle Ages and so on. That is what you do as well. To use the stories of the Viennese master to understand Kali\u0026rsquo;s child is like using creationism to portray Darwin\u0026rsquo;s theory. You are blind to this distortion as well. So, how could you describe Ramakrishna, when you cannot see him? You cannot; the second charge is obviously not so farfetched after all.\nThis blindness inherent in your venture must render us blind too whether the \u0026lsquo;us\u0026rsquo; is a Sudhir Kakar or a Sumit Sarkar. It does. But in a different way and for a different reason. I suppose you have no problem in accepting the suggestion that theories about cultural worlds have their roots in the experiences of such worlds. These theories describe experiences; they reflect on experiences; they problematize such experiences and think through them. In other words, if I want to theorize about the Indian culture, I need to have access to an experience of the Indian culture (whether directly or indirectly). These explanations deny the access by acting as a filter between our own experiences and us. In one sense, all theories act as some kind of a filter: they select some salient aspect of the experience and focus upon it. In the case we are talking about, the situation is not the same. These purported explanations act as a distorting glass. I knew I had such experiences; I saw that others apparently continued to have the experiences I had before (I continued to see adult male friends holding hands, I continued to see people going to do puja to the Shiva Linga, etc); I knew too that I had these but was unable to access them because of these explanations. That is, these explanations came actively between my own experiences and me, and actively prevented me from describing or reflecting on my own experiences. Did I really \u0026lsquo;see\u0026rsquo; the homosexuality of my friend when he held my hands? No. Did I really \u0026lsquo;see\u0026rsquo; the penis when I looked at the Lingam? No, I did not. Our experiences of the world and the explanations that are used are at loggerheads with each other: without speaking about experience, one cannot say what the \u0026lsquo;Indian experience\u0026rsquo; consists of; the (Freudian) stories we reproduce tell us that there is no \u0026lsquo;Indian experience\u0026rsquo; to talk of.\nThis is the lot and daily life of cultures and peoples colonized by the western culture. The colonization, as many have pointed out, was not merely a process of occupying lands and extracting revenues. It is not a question of us aping the western countries and trying to be like them. It is not even about colonizing the imaginations of a people by making them \u0026lsquo;dream\u0026rsquo; that they too will become \u0026lsquo;modern\u0026rsquo;, developed and sophisticated. It goes deeper than any of these. It is about denying the peoples and cultures their own experiences; of rendering them aliens to themselves; of actively preventing any description of their own experiences except in terms defined by the colonizers. This is the truth about what the Kakars and the Sarkars of my world sell, no matter how they package it, no matter how they market it.\nOf course, there is a very substantial issue here: why do we, Indians, continue to be colonized when the \u0026lsquo;real event\u0026rsquo; ended more than fifty years ago? I will negatively address myself to this issue shortly only to say what the answer cannot be. In this process, I can answer some possible objections, and bring the case to a conclusion.\nThe third charge is that your stance prevents you knowing you are blind. That is to say, why are you blind? Better said, what makes you blind? The answer to this has layers too, and let me peel just a few of them. To do that, I shall have to engage you in your own territory, on your own turf. That is, I want to talk to you about your understanding of your own culture and religion. (Is this not what \u0026lsquo;cultural hermeneutics\u0026rsquo; all about?) Let me, therefore, play the ventriloquist and displace your voice to ask myself a few questions: Is the alienation from our own experience (that I spoke of) any different from what any believer undergoes in the west, when he \u0026lsquo;discovers\u0026rsquo; that God is dead? Is my experience any different from a westerner losing his belief about God and the mystic? Are our travails anything other than the story of \u0026lsquo;modernity\u0026rsquo; as it plays out in India? 16. Yes, to all three questions. Let me get again into an autobiographical mode to talk about some of them. I did not quite tell you what happened during those decades to me when we fast forwarded. Let us rewind a bit and see what happened to the lad between his 18th and 30th year. You see, he wanted to change the world and became a radical. He left home before he was even twenty, lived in the slums, worked in the quarry, went to the villages and even became a Marxist for a period of time. From an \u0026lsquo;orthodox\u0026rsquo; Brahmin, he had metamorphosed into a fire-breathing \u0026lsquo;atheist\u0026rsquo;: India was backward, the \u0026lsquo;caste system\u0026rsquo; was a curse, the Indian traditions were outdated, the \u0026lsquo;gods\u0026rsquo; (though he still wrote it with a \u0026lsquo;small g\u0026rsquo;!) did not exist (except that they once walked the lands of Europe!). A run-of-the-mill progressive, in other words. In short, the revolution could not come soon enough for him. However, what brought him to Marxism also brought him out of it: the inability of these stories to make sense of his experience. So, he came to Europe, not in search of the Holy Grail (how could he? He was born a Brahmin after all!) but to study the root-cause of the problems in Marxist theory. You see, in those days it was difficult for us to find books of Hegel, Fichte, Schelling and many other German philosophers in the public libraries. Even as I began to solve my problems with Marx, a new issue was beginning to force itself on me: I had dimly begun to realize that I was an Indian, and that I lived as such in a culture I hardly understood.\nThis realization turned my world upside down; in doing so, however, it helped me regain access to my own experiences. The world that got turned upside down was the one I thought I lived in all the time. I had thought until then that I knew the western culture like the back of my hand: it was a shock to discover just how far I was from knowing either. I could hold forth on the notions of \u0026lsquo;civil society\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;ought\u0026rsquo; in ethics, the histories of renaissance and enlightenment and, why, I could even eat meat and drink wine. None of these, I discovered, meant anything: I was and remained an Indian, even if I once thought I was \u0026lsquo;modern\u0026rsquo;. Thus, I reflected on my experiences (fed by reading and yet more reading) until I could begin to grasp the outlines of the question, what is to be an Indian? Seventeen years ago, I formulated these reflections as a research project, titling it after a poem from T.S. Eliot that goes like this: \u0026lsquo;\u0026hellip;We shall not cease from exploration, and the end of our exploring shall be to arrive where we started and know the place for the first time\u0026rsquo;. I had indeed arrived where I had started from: India, Bangalore, a Brahmin family. I began to know the place too for the first time, because, at last, I could begin to access my own cultural experiences in the way they need to be accessed. However, the job is not complete and the process not yet over. During all these years, I have been constructing the tools required to gain access to our experiences because I realized too that my individual biography was but the Indian history writ small.\nThat is why I can now say that discovering lingam was called \u0026lsquo;penis\u0026rsquo; did not rob me of my world the same way atheism robs a believer of his world in the western culture. It could not. There are so many reasons why these two processes are not even remotely similar that I cannot hope to mention any of them in the course of this column. Instead, let me recount a story taken from the Chandogya Upanishad.\nIt appears Prajapathi said that he who has found the \u0026lsquo;Self\u0026rsquo; (Atman) and understands it obtains all worlds and all desires. \u0026ldquo;The Devas and the Asuras both heard these words, and said: \u0026lsquo;Well, let us search for that Self by which, if one has searched it out, all worlds and all desires are obtained\u0026rsquo;. Thus saying Indra from the Devas, Virochana from the Asuras, and both without having communicated with each other, approached Prajapathi… They dwelt there as pupils for thirty-two years. Then Prajapathi asked them: \u0026lsquo;For what purpose have you both dwelt here?\u0026rsquo; They both replied: \u0026lsquo;A saying of yours is being repeated … Now we have both dwelt here because we wish for that Self\u0026rsquo;.\u0026rdquo; He makes them both look in a pan of water and asks them what they see. They see their own bodies reflected. He makes them dress up and look again into the water pan asks them what they see. \u0026ldquo;They said: \u0026lsquo;Just as we are, well adorned, with our best clothes and clean, thus we are both there, Sir, well adorned, with our best clothes and clean.\u0026rsquo; Prajapathi said: \u0026ldquo;That is the Self, this is the immortal, the fearless, this is the Brahman\u0026rsquo;. They both went away satisfied in their hearts.\u0026rdquo; Prajapathi reflects on their absence of critical thought and thinks that whichever of the two follows this line of thought will \u0026lsquo;perish\u0026rsquo;. The story continues: \u0026ldquo;Now Virochana, satisfied in his heart, went to the Asuras and preached that doctrine to them, that the self (the body) alone is to be worshipped, that the self (the body) alone is to be served, and that he who worships the self and serves the self, gains both worlds, this and the next.\u0026rdquo; The Story further continues about what Indra did, but that is not relevant to me now. What are the three obvious points in the story:\n18.1. Both the Ausuras and the Devas seek enlightenment. Quite obviously, as this story makes clear, this state does not consist of \u0026lsquo;believing in\u0026rsquo; some deva or the other for the simple reason that they, the devas, thirst after enlightenment too! Further, to reach this state, as it becomes evident when we follow the story further, no \u0026lsquo;grace\u0026rsquo; of any kind of \u0026lsquo;God\u0026rsquo; is required: one needs to think through. (The Indian traditions speak of any number of other ways too, but that need not detain us here.) From this it follows that one\u0026rsquo;s enlightenment is the result of one\u0026rsquo;s own effort. It is a deserved \u0026lsquo;reward\u0026rsquo; that is in proportion to the effort you put in. Between you and the enlightenment, which is the ultimate goal in life, no one or no thing can counteract your efforts.\n18.2. Virochana\u0026rsquo;s insight that the body requires worshipping because it is the \u0026lsquo;Self\u0026rsquo; is a wrong answer because it is superficial. The answer, however, is not false. As the story evolves further, the reader appreciates that the Asura\u0026rsquo;s answer is superficial because Indra is provided with a \u0026lsquo;deeper\u0026rsquo; answer. Some answer is superficial only relative to a deeper one but that does not make the former into a false answer. Virochana\u0026rsquo;s insight appears as materialistic and as \u0026lsquo;atheistic\u0026rsquo; as they come: yet, the story seems to condone it as a possible answer (though wrong and superficial) to seek enlightenment. (This answer will not \u0026lsquo;help\u0026rsquo; and that is why it is wrong.) The discovery that all there is to life is the life one has, or the body one has, does not rob an Indian of anything. Very sharply put: in the Indian traditions, \u0026lsquo;atheism\u0026rsquo; (of a particular sort, see below) can also be a way of reaching enlightenment. (We are not yet talking about \u0026lsquo;Buddhism\u0026rsquo;!) This claim is not even remotely similar to the shock of \u0026lsquo;discovering\u0026rsquo; (in the western culture) that \u0026lsquo;God is dead\u0026rsquo;.\n18.3. What kind of \u0026lsquo;atheism\u0026rsquo; am I talking about? Not Western atheism because that makes no sense to the Indian traditions because of two things: (a) As the story above suggests, the road to \u0026rsquo;enlightenment\u0026rsquo; does not go through Jerusalem. That is, Prajapthi does not tell Indra that he should \u0026lsquo;believe\u0026rsquo; in \u0026lsquo;God\u0026rsquo; in order to be enlightened. (b) Consequently, Indian traditions are not \u0026rsquo;theistic\u0026rsquo; (poly-, heno- or mono- or whatever) the way Judaism, Christianity and Islam are. Consequently, western forms of \u0026lsquo;atheism\u0026rsquo; do not have the western kind of a theistic doctrine to oppose, when they come to India.\nYou might object that the distinction drawn I have drawn above between the \u0026lsquo;wrong\u0026rsquo; answer and the \u0026lsquo;false\u0026rsquo; one is a quibble about the meaning of words. It is not: there is a cognitive issue involved here. When one has a false answer, one can know that it is false and, perhaps, even localize its falsity. To reject a false answer, one does not need the presence of an alternative answer. This is not the case with a wrong answer. One might \u0026lsquo;feel\u0026rsquo; that something is wrong without being able to say what is wrong or even reject the wrong answer. (Look at what I have been saying throughout this communication.) One needs the presence of an alternative and a better answer in order to say what was wrong with the \u0026lsquo;wrong answer\u0026rsquo; and reject it.\n18.4. The contrast between our Asuras and the Devil in the Bible cannot be greater. Even though, in the classical but simple interpretation, the Devil himself is a fallen angel, he does not believe in God, but merely acknowledges His existence. As the Gospel puts it, \u0026ldquo;Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble\u0026rdquo; (James 2:26; my emphasis.) The Devil makes us deny the \u0026rsquo;true\u0026rsquo; God, says the religion that Christianity is. God reveals Himself to save us from the \u0026lsquo;clutches\u0026rsquo; of the Devil, it assures us further. To become an atheist in the West is to lose \u0026lsquo;faith\u0026rsquo; in this revelation. Where is this \u0026lsquo;atheism\u0026rsquo; and where our traditions? Where is the Devil, and where our Asuras?\nThus, our Asuras are not like the Devil or his minions in the Bible. Not only do they seek \u0026rsquo;enlightenment\u0026rsquo;, as the above story makes it clear, but some of them are also the greatest of the bhaktas of our devatas. The reason why Rama was born, they say, was to kill Ravana \u0026ndash; a supreme Bhakta. He deserved not to die in any way other than by being slain by Vishnu himself. To this day, we celebrate the greatest king (an asura) we ever had, and the greatest bhakta who ever lives: Lord Bali (an immortal) on whose head Trivikrama (Vaamana, as he is also called) placed his third foot. Each year, it appears, he ascends from the bottom of the earth to find out how his subjects are faring: the streets are lit as our houses with their doors open, so that he may come in and feel welcomed. We call this the festival of lights, the Deepavali. You know all this. Why do I tell it to you then? It is to say that our \u0026lsquo;atheisms\u0026rsquo;, our \u0026lsquo;asuras\u0026rsquo;, the \u0026lsquo;immorality\u0026rsquo; of our devas do not rob us of our traditions the way atheism does rob a believer in the West. Devatas may die, be born again, punished, or even remain immortal: our traditions do not suffer from any of these but live on precisely because of these. Consequently, today, without rejecting any piece of knowledge I have ever learnt, I can access my traditions and my experience in a very profound way. That is why, Jeffrey Kripal, you would be wrong to say that what I felt when I was fourteen is what the believer feels when he loses his faith in the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. This is another process altogether. When people protest against your portrayal of Ramakrishna, the majority of the Indians are not saying what you think they are. The language they use may sound familiar to your ears; what they say might remind you of your own experience. To see and understand us this way, however, is to understand very little about what makes us into different cultures or even what is interesting about this.\nDuring the last two decades, I did not merely build the tools to recover my own experiences. I discovered that I could not do this without understanding the western culture either. My attempts at understanding one could not be begun without trying to understand the other. To know my mother better, it appears, I need to know my mother-in-law as well. So, let us look at how youhave been treating the latter because we know what you have done with the former. How has psychoanalysis, sociology, psychology, anthropology, or whatever else described what religion is? That is to say, what do they assume when they try to explain religion, if they explain it at all? They assume that religion is a human product, if not a human invention. But Jeffrey Kripal, this assumption denies them their study object: A Christian believer sees the Bible as the word of God and not just as a book. You cannot explain this belief by appealing to any sets of natural causes unless you begin with the assumption that the believer is wrong about his own experience. Of course, you cannot countenance God in your research; however, if you do not, you are not studying religion as the believer experiences it, but its caricatured representation. In other words, your Freud cannot explain religion. He explains it as merely a human product, an assumption for which he has no grounds. To formulate simply: atheism is a philosophical option, but this option will deny you from doing science. Doing theism, however, will give you theology but not science. To a Christian, the existence or non-existence of Jesus is of great importance, but the answer to the question about the historical Jesus will not tell you anything about his Christ-Nature. If he is not the Christ, Jesus of Nazareth is merely a man, not even \u0026rsquo;the Son of Man\u0026rsquo;. But then, of course, you cannot assume that Jesus is Christ and write a scientific tract about it either. Underlying this dilemma is a whole host of other problems. (To write further on this requires a book. I have written one such, which you might care to read.) Therefore, it appears, by assuming the stance that you do towards the study of religion, you do \u0026lsquo;unto your fellow-men what you do unto us as well.\u0026rsquo; You caricature the experience of the believer in your culture; you caricature the experiences of our entire culture. It is this that blinds you to what you are doing.\nThat means, your descriptions of our experiences are doubly caricatured. Firstly, you tell us that what we \u0026lsquo;see\u0026rsquo; is not what we \u0026lsquo;see\u0026rsquo;: the linga is not the linga but a penis. As I said earlier, this is what religions like Christianity and Islam had told us. You tell me they are right. This way, you impose your cultural experience upon us and deny our experiences. Secondly, you tell us that, even here, what we do is something else: it transpires that we are not \u0026lsquo;worshipping\u0026rsquo; penis or falling in love with Shiva. We do not \u0026lsquo;worship\u0026rsquo; at all (one can only \u0026lsquo;worship\u0026rsquo; either God or the Devil) and Shiva is but an \u0026rsquo;erotic ascetic\u0026rsquo;. The aspect has two tails that sting: why does the imagination of the Indian culture express itself in such grotesque forms as the penis, the monkey, the stone idol with four arms, and an elephant-headed human? Why is the western imagination confined to more \u0026lsquo;decent\u0026rsquo; things like visualizing God as the \u0026lsquo;father\u0026rsquo;? Enter Wendy Doniger and her children, who answer these questions in ways known to us all. Is there any wonder people are furious? Are you really that amazed?\nLet me bring the case to a conclusion: what are you trying to \u0026lsquo;understand\u0026rsquo; when you use your \u0026lsquo;hermeneutic\u0026rsquo; to understand Ramakrishna? How you see him? How your culture sees him? Or how we see him? What are you theorizing about? Your experience, your culture\u0026rsquo;s experience, or ours? You insist that how your culture experiences the world is also the only possible experience of the world. (Not explicitly, of course. But, as I have argued, that is what you do.) You want to tell us what Ramakrishna\u0026rsquo;s \u0026lsquo;mysticism\u0026rsquo; is all about because this is the only way your theories allow you to see it. Your theories, your explanations, your assumptions deny us what you would not, as a person, dream of denying to us: that we too have an experience, another one perhaps, but one that is as \u0026lsquo;valid and legitimate\u0026rsquo; as any human experience can be.\nYou end your article with these words: \u0026ldquo;I at least am ready to laugh again, to exchange gifts, to argue, to apologize, to weep. I always have been.\u0026rdquo; I believe you. But do you know, people from other cultures do so too? We too laugh, exchange gifts, argue, apologize and weep? You know that we do it; you assume you know what they are because that is what you do too. But do you know how we do any or all of these things? Does it occur to you that we might do them differently? Do you, Jeffrey Kripal, know how we cry or even why? I wonder.\nFriendly greetings\nBalu\nThe translation is taken from Müller. The Upanishads.

A Wendy says \u0026ldquo;Yes\u0026rdquo;, a Balu says \u0026ldquo;No\u0026rdquo;. For some person, not on this board, there is not a dialog; it is a reading of Wendy, a reading of Balu - how to decide between the two answers, which one represents the truth about Hindus?\u0026rdquo;\nDepending on the patience of the visitor, a number of answers are possible including an identification of the nature of the dispute.\nIn the context of the Catholic mass, do the bread and the wine mean or refer to anything other than the flesh and blood of Christ? The Catholics say \u0026lsquo;yes\u0026rsquo; (this is their doctrine of \u0026rsquo;transubstantiation\u0026rsquo;), the Protestant says \u0026rsquo;no\u0026rsquo;. How to decide between the two answers and which one represents the truth about the Catholics? Or does one want to say, which one represents the truth about Christianity? Or does one want to say, which one represents the truth about the world? Notice that, in each case, the dispute is not about the meaning (connotation) or the reference (denotation) of the word \u0026lsquo;bread\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;wine\u0026rsquo;: it is a theological dispute that appears to be about the meaning and reference of words. So, how to decide between the answer in this case? Depends on your theology.\nIn the context of Christian worship, does the word \u0026lsquo;The Bible\u0026rsquo; connote or denote anything other than the word of God, in particular a book? One says \u0026lsquo;yes\u0026rsquo;, the believer says \u0026rsquo;no\u0026rsquo;. Is this about the meaning or reference of the word \u0026lsquo;The Bible\u0026rsquo;? In English, the word \u0026lsquo;The Bible\u0026rsquo; does not mean \u0026lsquo;a book\u0026rsquo;. It is a name. What does it name? A book. Any book? No. All books? No. Only books? No, because it could be a scroll too. So, some books, some scrolls and even some \u0026lsquo;recitations\u0026rsquo; could all be called \u0026lsquo;The Bible\u0026rsquo;. Let us go further. Could one use the word \u0026lsquo;The Bible\u0026rsquo; to name any of the above in different languages? Well, yes. So, what does the word \u0026lsquo;The Bible\u0026rsquo; name? Something that is \u0026rsquo;the same\u0026rsquo; irrespective of the language, or the form this \u0026lsquo;something\u0026rsquo; assumes. \u0026lsquo;The Bible\u0026rsquo; names this. So, what is the dispute about? The one who says that \u0026lsquo;The Bible\u0026rsquo; denotes or connotes \u0026lsquo;a book\u0026rsquo; is fixated on the physical shape of some book he saw somewhere and somewhen without even thinking his own claim through. So, one does not even have to refer to what the believers believe in order to show this. How to decide between the answers in this case? Depends on your understanding of what language is with respect to its use sociologically.\nIn the context of physics, does the word \u0026lsquo;mass\u0026rsquo; denote or connote an invariant or a variable? A Newtonian says an \u0026lsquo;invariant\u0026rsquo;; an Einsteinian says a \u0026lsquo;variable\u0026rsquo;. For someone who does not know Physics, there is no dialogue. A reading of a Newton and a reading of Einstein. How to decide between the two readings, which one represents the truth about the physicists? I am sure we can elaborate on these ourselves. What is the dispute about? The truth of the reading has to do not with the community of physicists, not what any group says at any given moment of time, but with what a scientific theory is and how one chooses between competing theories.\nThese three examples are enough to illustrate the following: what appears as a dispute about the meaning and reference of words can be about things that have absolutely nothing to do with either the denotation or the connotation of the words. This is the first thing one will have to tell someone who is not on the board. Having said this, we can now focus on what the dispute is between a Wendy and a Balu.\nIn the context of puja, does Shivalinga denote or connote anything other than Shiva, in particular \u0026ldquo;phallus\u0026rdquo;? Does ShivaLinga \u0026lsquo;mean\u0026rsquo; phallus? No, of course not. (\u0026lsquo;Linga\u0026rsquo; might, but not \u0026lsquo;Shivalinga\u0026rsquo;. But I will come to this.) Does the word mean \u0026rsquo;the phallus of Shiva\u0026rsquo;? Yes it does. In what way, precisely? The only way of answering this question is to circumscribe the reference first. Let us assume the existence of an entity \u0026rsquo;named\u0026rsquo; Shiva. Let us assume too that he has a phallus. Then Shiva Linga names the phallus of Shiva. However, if it refers to such a unique entity as \u0026rsquo;the\u0026rsquo; phallus of Shiva there can be only one such. (Shiva does not have infinite number of phalluses; and Shiva is an entity different from Durga, Ganesha and, say, a mortal called Balu.) So, do we do puja to this unique entity? That cannot be the case: there are finitely many shiva lingas in India and outside. So, what we do puja to is not a unique entity which is \u0026rsquo;the\u0026rsquo; phallus of Shiva but a \u0026lsquo;form\u0026rsquo; (or \u0026lsquo;representation\u0026rsquo;) of this unique entity. What kind of a \u0026lsquo;form\u0026rsquo; is this? It cannot connote or denote the \u0026lsquo;material\u0026rsquo; of which \u0026rsquo;the\u0026rsquo; phallus is made of. Whatever be the material out of which \u0026rsquo;the\u0026rsquo; phallus of Shiva is constructed, it cannot be simultaneously constructed out of stone, aluminum, marble and so on. So, it will have to be the \u0026lsquo;shape\u0026rsquo; of \u0026rsquo;the\u0026rsquo; phallus of Shiva. Therefore, if something is to be a \u0026lsquo;Shiva linga\u0026rsquo; at all, it must have a shape of \u0026rsquo;the\u0026rsquo; phallus of Shiva and that shape must be invariant across Shiva lingas.\nThe very same devotees of Shiva, however, do puja to \u0026lsquo;Jyothirlinga\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;Aatmalinga\u0026rsquo; too. They are Shiva Lingas as well. Either one denies, pace the above argument, that these two are Shiva Lingas at all, or one has to say that these Lingas have the same \u0026lsquo;shape\u0026rsquo; as \u0026rsquo;the\u0026rsquo; phallus of Shiva. Neither of these two possibilities is true. The first is empirically false (both synchronically and diachronically); the second is to literally \u0026lsquo;see\u0026rsquo; phallus where there is none, in \u0026rsquo;light\u0026rsquo;.\nThe only possible conclusion: Shivalinga cannot possibly refer to the \u0026lsquo;shape\u0026rsquo; of \u0026rsquo;the\u0026rsquo; phallus of Shiva. It is a form, which has little to do with the \u0026lsquo;shape\u0026rsquo; of Shiva\u0026rsquo;s Penis. Thus, for the lack of an alternative (at this stage of the discussion), we have to settle for the following: ShivaLinga is the \u0026lsquo;form\u0026rsquo; in which we do Puja to Shiva. Apparently, this mind-numbing (linguistic and philosophical) tour merely tells us what our grandmothers told us in all their simplicity: we do puja to Shiva in the form of Linga.\nOf course, one can go further in such a discussion along any number of other lines. It is not my intent and, I presume, neither yours to do so. Hopefully, this goes some way to clarifying the question you raised. The issues and the disputes are not so arbitrary any more than they are merely questions of alternate readings or etymological fights. Other substantial issues are involved and it is not an \u0026lsquo;undecidable\u0026rsquo;!\n","tags":["Wendy Doniger"],"title":"Does Shivalinga ‘mean’ phallus? A theoretical dispute","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/does-shivalinga-mean-phallus-a-theoretical-dispute-s-n-balagangadhara/"},{"categories":["dialogues","Balagangadhara"],"content":" Let us begin with one of the minimal conditions for inter-cultural (verbal) communication. And that is: people should be able to have conversations with each other. It is legitimate to claim that one does not need to know what a \u0026lsquo;conversation\u0026rsquo; is in order to have a conversation. Therefore, whatever else we may want to say, it would be very difficult to maintain that there is no conversation in other cultures. Equally difficult would it be to hold that some cultures are inferior to others regarding their practice of conversational activity. In other words, our intuitions do not allow us to assert either a factual or a normative claim, which would either deny the existence of conversation in other cultures or suggest that members from some cultures are incompetent conversationalists.\nThe western culture has produced several theories about and several theorists of conversation. These theories are the results of research into the nature of conversation. Such theories shed light on the nature and properties of conversation. Some of the famous maxims of conversation are known (and practiced?) by many of us. Strange though this suggestion might sound, we have learnt such maxims in the West after we left India. As examples, consider the following two maxims: \u0026lsquo;Be relevant\u0026rsquo; (or \u0026lsquo;be to the point\u0026rsquo;) and \u0026lsquo;Be brief\u0026rsquo;.\nWhatever these theories do or do not, they should at least help us affirm the points made in the first paragraph. In order to see how our theories of conversation help us relate to them, let me introduce the following scenarios set in the Asian continent. (All of them true, all narrated to me by the Europeans and a few any numbers of times. That is why I have structured the scenarios the way I have.).\n3.1. As a white man and foreigner, you are a teacher in an English class in China. All of a sudden, one fine day, the Chinese director of the school drops in during the afternoon and requests to speak to you. After nearly a quarter of an hour, during which time the director has praised your work and qualities sky high, and just when you thought that he was coming to the real point of his visit he politely takes leave. You know that what he said was not \u0026lsquo;what he came to say\u0026rsquo;; nevertheless, you also realize that \u0026lsquo;something\u0026rsquo; has been said. (This is the experience of an American, who suffered a nervous breakdown after living for about two years in China under these conditions.)\n3.2. As a white man and foreigner, you are travelling somewhere in Asia (say, Thailand). Intending to take the public transport, you go to a bus stop and enquire a native passer-by when the next bus is due. The native consults his wristwatch, assures you that you could expect it any minute and moves along. An hour and a half later, while still waiting for the same bus, you spy the same native returning from his errand. Furious, you collar him and ask him the same question. Though a bit surprised at your rage, when the native gives the same answer, you realize that you have been had: that guy had no more clue about the bus timings than you had!\n3.3. As a white man and foreigner, you are travelling on a train in India. Seated next to you is a Brahmin, eager to strike up a conversation and impress you with his learning. Your sensibility is shocked by the poverty in India, and by the existence of \u0026lsquo;untouchability\u0026rsquo; in that culture. Outraged and incensed by the indifference that Indians show to poverty and suffering around them, you quiz this Brahmin about why he is unmoved. The Brahmin assures you with great solemnity that most of the \u0026lsquo;beggars\u0026rsquo; you have seen are really no beggars at all, but, to the contrary, rather wealthy. Many, in fact, are wealthier than either of you. In support of this fact, the Brahmin tells you a tale (an anecdote) about some beggars who turned about to be the greedy rich in disguise! Regarding the lot of those beggars who are not cheaters, he merely shrugs his shoulders and says that it is their karma. You are utterly shocked by both the flimsiness of his \u0026rsquo;explanation\u0026rsquo; and by the total lack of humanity in that Brahmin. Both of you know that the \u0026lsquo;anecdote\u0026rsquo; was a figment of his imagination.\nEach of the three scenarios is a part of our folklore: almost each traveler and tourist who has been to Asia will have some such tale to tell.\nThere will not be much of a controversy, if we identify all three as conversations. That is to say, two or more people are involved; there was some kind of a question and answer, some exchange of information in some context or the other. We do not suppose that one needs to be knowledgeable about conversation theory in order to identify that a conversation has taken place. And yet, were we to look at some of the existing theories about what conversation is, we are led to some nontrivial and startling conclusions: it would appear either that there has been no conversation at all or that in each of them some or other \u0026lsquo;maxim\u0026rsquo; has been violated.\nIn and of itself, this piece of knowledge is not startling. But it does become so when we take into account that these types of conversation are not exceptions but standards, and that they all are examples from non-western cultures!\nIn the first case, for example, the Chinese director was neither brief nor relevant; in the second, the native was violating the \u0026lsquo;cooperation principle\u0026rsquo; and was lying; in the third the same holds true as well.\nOur theories of conversation, then, generate the conclusions that other cultures either do not know how to have a conversation or that they always violate the norms of conversation or, even more crudely put, most of the time only westerners are competent conversationalists. This is a logical possibility, to be sure; but there is something utterly implausible about such conclusions. Our conversational \u0026rsquo;theories\u0026rsquo; generate such conclusions because of some assumptions they make. Let me try and identify just three of them.\nThe first assumption: Common to all (or nearly all) theories of conversation is the assumption that conversational relations (like, say, that of \u0026lsquo;relevance\u0026rsquo;) hold between beliefs. (I do not mean religious beliefs, but beliefs of any kind.) That is to say, the semantic relations between propositions constitute the main area of inquiry. (Some statement A is relevant to some statement B: therefore, \u0026lsquo;relevance\u0026rsquo; has to do with the meaning of the statements A and B.)\nThe second assumption: Theories of conversation do not refer to the fact that it is people who indulge in conversation; yet, one intuitively thinks that it is human beings who indulge in conversations. These two ideas are not (necessarily) opposed to each other. That is, the distance between the theories and our intuitions is bridged (often) by a metaphysical assumption, which is highly culture specific: only human beings have beliefs. Or, at least: human beings embody beliefs.\nThe third assumption: With respect to this property of embodying beliefs, there is a third assumption about the nature of persons. This says that humans are equal with respect to this property.\nThe first assumption allows you to \u0026lsquo;discover\u0026rsquo; relations between beliefs; the second and the third assumptions enable you to develop a general theory of what it is to have a conversation. If this caricature is even approximately true, we can raise the question now: What if there exist cultures and societies, where none of the above assumptions are true? That is, what if there are cultures and societies, which do not make this kind of a distinction between human beings and the rest of nature; to whom the \u0026lsquo;observational\u0026rsquo; term, viz., human beings turns out to be a very \u0026rsquo;theoretical\u0026rsquo; term? Clearly, in such cases, our theories of conversation break down. By the same token, they cease being universal in the sense of being theories of human communication.\nWhat I would like to propose is that this is indeed the case: in each of the scenarios sketched above, what we see is the breakdown of our theories of conversation. In these cultures, the kind of conversation held depends on exactly who the participants are; the \u0026lsquo;relevant\u0026rsquo; answer to a question depends upon just who is asking the question and who is doing the answering. What is a relevant answer to a question in one conversation need not be a relevant answer to the same question in another conversation.\nThe above considerations are enough for me to raise two general points: one about us and the other about inter-cultural communication. Let me begin with the first. Why do we Indians, so proudly at times, accept ideas from conversation theories (even if we do not know where they come from) with so little reflection? In fact, I have had people preaching to me that we Indians are a \u0026lsquo;garrulous\u0026rsquo; lot and that we better learn from the western culture the virtues of being relevant, brief and to the point. Why so little understanding of the issues involved? Why the urge not to think our own experiences through and look at our own inheritance and culture? I do not want to praise the Indian culture as the best form of life; but I do want to say that it is our form of life and just as \u0026lsquo;valid\u0026rsquo; as any other form of life. Let us learn all we want to and can from the West: I have learnt a great deal already and continue to do so. But that is possible only if we do not denigrate either of the two cultures. (This is a huge issue, and I hope to return to this someday.) Personally, I am only glad that I have learnt to know them both so intimately.\nIf we continue along the lines of the thoughts sketched above, we see that the theorists of inter-cultural communication have not even begun to suspect the kind of problems involved in thinking about the theme. No wonder the problems of inter-cultural communication, instead of going away, return with a vengeance. Because, as the earlier points will have hinted at, the entire discussion is not about inter-cultural communication at all but about intra-cultural communication. Better put, the whole issue is about the monologue the western culture has within itself and other cultures have to merely play their scripted role. How should different cultures speak both to the West and to each other within the framework of the western culture? Obviously, this is not merely a cultural, political or an economic question but one that arises within the theories of conversation!\nIn other words, the \u0026ldquo;denial of our experience\u0026rdquo; takes place in more forms and fashions than we understand. While we protest about it in one area, we acquiesce to it in another. This is something we need to keep in mind.

The inherent logic of such an enterprise forces one, as it were, to build alternate theories to the existing, \u0026lsquo;western\u0026rsquo; theories. Instead of explaining this statement in the abstract, let me take a concrete example to illustrate what I mean.\n1.2. In the University of Chicago, there is a certain Richard Shweder. He practices \u0026lsquo;Cultural Psychology\u0026rsquo;, and is (was?) professor of \u0026lsquo;Human Development\u0026rsquo;. He is rather well-known for his \u0026lsquo;cross-cultural\u0026rsquo; studies: he and his students have published many works comparing psychological developments across the two cultures that India and America are. (In fact, he received a medal from the American Association of the Advancement of Science, if I remember properly, for one of his articles: \u0026lsquo;Does the concept of the Person vary cross-culturally?\u0026rsquo; This was a study about the concept of \u0026lsquo;self\u0026rsquo; in the USA and Orissa, India.) A few years ago, he published a study on the nature of moral development and the growth of moral awareness cross-culturally: again, India and the USA were the two compared cultures.\n1.3. To study this, Shweder and his co-workers developed a questionnaire supposed to test the presence of several moral notions among their subjects. (This article is called \u0026ldquo;Culture and Moral Development\u0026rsquo;, by Richard Shweder, Manamohan Mahapatra and Joan G. Miller. A convenient reprint is to be found in \u0026ldquo;Cultural Psychology: Essays on Comparative Human Development, Eds., James Stigler, Richard Shweder and Gibert Herdt, Cambridge University Press, 1990, Pp.130-204. I will cite from this work.) The interviewees are both children and adults. From the list of the cases that Shweder uses, here are the first five - in order of perceived \u0026lsquo;seriousness of breach\u0026rsquo;, as judged by Hindu Brahman eight-to ten-year-olds:\nThe day after his father\u0026rsquo;s death, the eldest son had a haircut and ate chicken.\nOne of your family members eats beef regularly.\nOne of your family members eats a dog regularly for dinner.\nA widow in your community eats fish two or three times a week.\nSix months after the death of her husband, the widow wore jewellery and bright-colored clothes (Ibid. p.165).\nIt is important to note that, in India, while there was a consensus between the children and the adults regarding the first two cases (p.184), there was a lack of consensus only among children regarding the last three cases. Keeping in mind that they are ordered in terms of the \u0026lsquo;perceived seriousness of the breach\u0026rsquo;, we further come across (ibid., P.165):\nAfter defecation (making a bowel movement) a woman did not change her clothes before cooking. 13.In a family, a twenty-five-year-old son addresses his father by his first name.\nAnd, as the fifteenth, \u0026ldquo;a poor man went to the hospital after being seriously hurt in an accident. At the hospital they refused to treat him because he could not afford to pay (ibid).\u0026rdquo;\n1.4. We can, I suppose, grant the truth of these statements. We can grant too that many Indians (both children and adults) would probably consider such actions not just as paap but as mahapaap. If not \u0026lsquo;sins\u0026rsquo;, they are at least some kind of \u0026rsquo;ethical transgressions\u0026rsquo; and not mere breaches of social etiquette. As the sequence of questions in the interview makes it clear, the respondents were asked to motivate (or clarify) their stance. A fragment from such interviews, applied to a hypothetical\nBrahmin adult should make the point clear.\n\u0026ldquo;1. Is the widow\u0026rsquo;s behavior wrong? (Yes, Widows should not eat fish ¼)\nHow serious is the violation? (A very serious violation¼)\nIs it a sin? (Yes. It\u0026rsquo;s a \u0026ldquo;great\u0026rdquo; sin.) ¼ \u0026quot; (p.168)\nLet us consider a similar fragment from a hypothetical American adult.\n\u0026ldquo;1. Is the widow\u0026rsquo;s behavior wrong? (No. She can eat fish if she wants to.)\nHow serious is the violation? (It\u0026rsquo;s not a violation.)\nIs it a sin? (No.)\u0026rdquo; ¼ (ibid.)\n1.5. If Shweder is right in identifying our paap either as \u0026lsquo;sin\u0026rsquo; or as \u0026lsquo;immoral\u0026rsquo;, one conclusion is inescapable: we Indians must be absolute cretins really. I mean, we seem to think that what the widow eats, what she wears, etc. are ethically more important than whether a poor man gets treated in a hospital or not. However did our culture manage to survive for a couple of thousand years, when it is governed by such idiotic \u0026rsquo;norms\u0026rsquo;?\nAs though to rub salt in the wound, Shweder assures us that the situation is really not all that pathetic. In fact, he says, one could actually provide \u0026lsquo;reasoned defense of family life and social practice\u0026rsquo;, albeit in the form of an \u0026ldquo;ideal\u0026rdquo; argument structure. How does it look? \u0026ldquo;The body is a temple with a spirit dwelling in it. Therefore the sanctity of the temple must be preserved. Therefore impure things must be kept out of and away from the body (p. 198).\u0026rdquo; It is important to note that this \u0026lsquo;reasoned\u0026rsquo; defense occurs only to Shweder\u0026rsquo;s mind: no child \u0026lsquo;argues\u0026rsquo; the way Shweder does.\nDuring the colonial period, we were described as immoral people. This is one end of the spectrum. At the other end, we have \u0026rsquo;liberals\u0026rsquo; like Shweder, who make us into a bunch of moral cretins. So, it appears, we have two choices: either we are immoral or we are moral idiots. Not much of a choice, is it?\nWhy does this situation come about? This is not a translation problem (\u0026lsquo;how should we translate paap into English?\u0026rsquo;), but an empirical and theoretical problem: what is it about the western ethical tradition that makes the Indian culture either immoral or morally senile?\nTo answer this question, we need to develop a theory of ethics, which does two things simultaneously: (a) show how and why there is an ethical domain in the Indian culture and in what ways it differs from the Western ethical domain; and (b) what are the constraints on the western ethical tradition that it is forced to describe us the way it has.\nThis means such a theory of ethics will be a direct competitor to the Western thinking on ethics. That is to say, our \u0026lsquo;westology\u0026rsquo; will not remain a mere \u0026lsquo;westology\u0026rsquo; but will be forced to provide an alternative and competing way of looking at the ethical phenomenon itself.\nThis is what I discovered when I started working my project out. My theory of religion is an alternate to the current theories of religion: it shows not merely that the western intellectuals are wrong but also explains why they had to be necessarily wrong. Idem for my current work in ethics.\nIt is here that one experiences the humiliation of racism. It is almost inconceivable to the western intellectuals, at least this has been my experience, that an Indian could stand up and prove that three hundred years of western scholarship has been wrong. You are never forgiven for this insult; I mean, it is simply not on. If you reproduce the \u0026lsquo;post-colonial\u0026rsquo; verbiage, you will be rewarded with a professorship in Columbia, Chicago or California. But, beware, if you say, let us compete on equal terms scientifically; may the best theory carry the day; and that happens to be your theory!\n","tags":["Rajiv Malhotra"],"title":"Why ‘Westology’ ala Indology doomed to fail?","uri":"/hipkapi/posts/why-westology-ala-indology-doomed-to-fail-s-n-balagangadhara/"},{"categories":["Balagangadhara","enlightenment"],"content":"I would like you to consider the following four kinds of answers, each pitched at a different level of generality and at a different level of description. One could provide more, but these four should be enough to give a taste of the kind of wine you might care to drink.\nSuppose that one were to ask you: how to go about doing \u0026lsquo;science\u0026rsquo; (in general) or, say, doing \u0026lsquo;physics\u0026rsquo;? What kind of an answer could you possibly give? If you do not want to be unkind, you will probably give answers that will not be satisfying to the questioner. Like what? May be you will say: one needs to read, think about a problem, provide a solution and critically evaluate the hypothetical answer and so on. If the questioner presses his point and asks: yes, but how does one go about doing any of these, what will your answer be? The only reasonable answer you can give him is to point him in the direction of a model: go, read that book on physics, you will perhaps say, and then you have an idea of what I am talking about.\nThis is also my second answer to your question. I have provided precisely such a model in my book \u0026ldquo;The Heathen in his blindness: Asia, the West and the dynamic of religion\u0026rdquo;. Developing an alternative to the existing social sciences is not the idle dream of a vain intellectual; there exists a model that has already begun the process. Therefore, from now on, the discussion is not any more about whether and how such attempts are necessary or desirable but one of evaluating the said model and, if found to be a beginning, continuing to build more such or similar models.\nIn what way, you may ask, will such an attempt be different than the existing social sciences? Instead of drawing your attention once again to answer (2) and say \u0026lsquo;go and find out how it is different\u0026rsquo;, I would like to take another route. I will treat your difficulty as a \u0026lsquo;philosophical\u0026rsquo; problem. As you say, the \u0026lsquo;facts\u0026rsquo; and the data\u0026rsquo; are the same; so \u0026ldquo;how do we build new standards/baseline\u0026rdquo;? Of course, the history of sciences (the natural sciences, that is) gives us any number of illustrations of what the question entails. Let me use the simplest one: people saw, and continue to see, the setting and rising of the sun; its movements across the horizon. These are the \u0026lsquo;facts\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;data\u0026rsquo; that all of us have. For a long period of time, some thought what they saw was how the world was. Then came some other people who said the following: this is indeed what we see, we are compelled to see it this way because the reality is exactly its opposite. That is, they explained not only what we saw, told us why our perception was wrong but, more importantly, told us too why we had to perceive it the way we do. (This was the novelty of the \u0026lsquo;heliocentric theory\u0026rsquo;. Aristarchus, I think his name was, had long, long ago developed the \u0026lsquo;heliocentric\u0026rsquo; theory as a possible model without, however, doing what Galileo\u0026rsquo;s explanation could, i.e. explain the \u0026rsquo;necessity\u0026rsquo; of this perception.) The \u0026lsquo;facts\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;data\u0026rsquo; were the \u0026lsquo;same\u0026rsquo; for both the geo- and helio-centric theories. The difference lay in their theories and, you will admit, what a difference it made! In this sense, the difference between the current and the \u0026rsquo;new\u0026rsquo; social sciences will be of the same kind. Believe me, when I tell you this in all seriousness, there is and there will be a world of a difference between what is and what is going to be. Of course, this is not yet enough for you to know the \u0026lsquo;quality\u0026rsquo; of the wine. Let me pour you a small glass, so that you may taste it for yourself.\nSince this wine is coming from my cellar, you are beholden to listen to me about how I acquired it. Such tales are not only a part of the ritual of tasting good wines but they also add to the taste of the wine. Nowhere is this analogy more apt than with respect to what i am now going to say. For a couple of years now, I am irresistibly pulled in the direction of \u0026lsquo;aadhyaatma\u0026rsquo;. More often than not and with increasing frequency, I contemplate on going on what we call \u0026lsquo;vaanaprastha\u0026rsquo;. I would have done it by now, were it not for the fact that I still have to do certain things as a \u0026lsquo;gruhastha\u0026rsquo;; but the pull is increasing. (No doubt, it has to do with my age and my cultural education; I am glad of them both, but this explanation does not lessen the force of the pull.) In any case, I have slowly started revisiting (in a manner that is different from the way I visit other books and articles, and I find myself spending more and more time doing so) some of the texts and some of the authors from the Indian traditions. Here are just two examples of the results of this \u0026lsquo;revisiting\u0026rsquo;.\n4.1. Most of us know the following verses from the gita that begins with \u0026ldquo;yadaa yadaa hi dharmasya\u0026rdquo; and ends with \u0026ldquo;sambhavaami yuge yuge.\u0026rdquo; Permit me to give a rough translation of these four lines for the sake of this discussion: \u0026ldquo;whenever dharma begins to wane and adharma waxes, which happens in each yuga; to protect the good and punish the wicked, and to re-establish dharma, iI fashion myself.\u0026rdquo; you also know how most have been taught to interpret these verses: krishna\u0026rsquo;s avataara occurs in each \u0026lsquo;yuga\u0026rsquo; and that it has either already taken place in our yuga, or that it will still happen again, etc. However, if you read it again with the eyes of a twenty first-century human being, here is what is striking and, if true, breath-taking. These verses are telling us the following (I am going to reformulate the substance of these verses in my terminology and not just provide an \u0026lsquo;interpretation\u0026rsquo;): there is an assumption that there is a process of learning to be moral and that this is a learning process in society. It is inevitable, this is the second assumption, any social learning process can and does undergo degeneration. From this it follows, this is what the verses now describe, that: when such a degeneration of the learning process occurs, at some critical phase in the degeneration at the level of society, other mechanisms in society are going to kick in and regenerate this learning process (i.e. the process of learning to be moral). This is a breath-taking claim about the nature of moral learning in India (let us keep it confined to India at the moment). Of course, they (the writer/writers of gita) formulate this \u0026lsquo;insight\u0026rsquo; using the images familiar to them about Krishna and his \u0026lsquo;avataaras\u0026rsquo;. But that need not detain us. But what should, is their insight into the nature of society. Where and how did they discover these things? How did they discuss these things? What kind of a research did they do so that they came to have this extraordinary insight? This insight, even if it proves to be wrong, is light years ahead of any extant psychological or sociological theory about moral learning and moral development that you care to mention. So, just these two verses are formulating a scientific hypothesis in the best sense of the term about the nature of moral learning. Believe me, I am dumb struck. The western culture has not even suspected the existence of what these verses take for granted (for example, the two assumptions I have just identified). How and why did the Indians think of these things those many thousands of years ago?\n4.2. A second example of a different kind, which is equally random. You know that Indians are alleged to believe in the \u0026lsquo;doctrine of punarjanma\u0026rsquo; (rebirth). You know too that either it causes \u0026rsquo;embarrassment\u0026rsquo; to the scientifically minded Indians or generates indifference in them. You also know, I suppose, that this \u0026lsquo;doctrine\u0026rsquo; plays an important role in the \u0026lsquo;Hindu\u0026rsquo; traditions, the \u0026lsquo;Buddhist\u0026rsquo; and the \u0026lsquo;Jain\u0026rsquo; traditions. So, how to understand this \u0026lsquo;doctrine\u0026rsquo;? (I will not talk here about the modern Indian philosophy because I find that the worst place to begin understanding anything Indian is the modern Indian philosophy. But this is an irrelevant pot-shot.) To understand this, i first need to set the problem up. Some Indian traditions claim that there is a difference between \u0026lsquo;aatma gyana\u0026rsquo; (or aatma vidya) and \u0026lsquo;brahma gyana\u0026rsquo; (or brahma vidya): the first precedes the second and the second follows the first. Despite this, the transition is neither smooth nor self-evident. So, what is the difficulty here? If you look at Shankaracharya (say his aatmabodha, for example), you can see what kind of a difficulty he is talking about. It is what we call \u0026rsquo;the problem of induction\u0026rsquo;, i.e. how could we make a universal statement on the basis of any number finite singular observations? (By observing that 10 Mexicans have a sombrero on, how justified are we in making the statement \u0026lsquo;all Mexicans wear sombreros\u0026rsquo;?) It transpires that the transition from aatmagyana to brahmagyana (at an experiential level and not as an abstract philosophical problem) involves such a difficulty: to go from the particular aatman to the universal brahman. (This is not esoteric, but experiential.) Here is what Shankara says: one must use yukti (\u0026rsquo;tricks\u0026rsquo;). He also gives an example of such a \u0026lsquo;yukti\u0026rsquo;: \u0026rsquo;neti neti\u0026rsquo; (not thus, not thus). In our modern day terminology, it merely means that one needs to use some cognitive strategies (i.e. heuristics, algorithms, rules of thumb, however you may want to call them) and \u0026rsquo;neti, neti\u0026rsquo; is one such. You know what is another such cognitive strategy? Exactly: the \u0026lsquo;doctrine\u0026rsquo; of punarjanma. (I will not go into how this strategy works, etc. on this thread.) What does this mean? The \u0026lsquo;doctrine\u0026rsquo; of punarjanma is not a \u0026lsquo;doctrine\u0026rsquo;: it is not a description of the world at all, but a cognitive strategy! If it is that, then we can understand why the \u0026lsquo;buddhists\u0026rsquo; speak of \u0026lsquo;punarjanma\u0026rsquo; even when they deny the existence of \u0026lsquo;aatman\u0026rsquo; and not face cognitive embarrassment. Not only that: if it is a cognitive strategy, it must be a recognizable part of the Buddhist \u0026lsquo;meditation\u0026rsquo;. If anyone has followed Buddhist meditation, you will know that this \u0026lsquo;doctrine\u0026rsquo; is used as a visualization technique in the process of generating certain kinds of emotions. Why is it that generations of Indian and western scholars insist talking about the \u0026lsquo;doctrine\u0026rsquo; of punarjanma and fail to see for what it is? You see, my research programme generates these kinds of reformulations of the \u0026lsquo;ancient\u0026rsquo; Indian traditions. (As far as I know, I am the only one who is making such extraordinary claims.) Tell me, would these constitute some indications of what it means to take steps in the process of building an \u0026lsquo;alternate\u0026rsquo; social science? Of course, this is just a sip of the wine: to prove that it is not sour, or is not over the hill. It has yet to reach its prime, and we have many more tons of grapes to harvest yet. But is it worth the effort? Is it promising? What do you think?\n","tags":["Gita"],"title":"How to go about developing an alternative to the so-called social sciences?  -- S.N.

Before we do either (this is one of the things I have discovered through my own research during the last two decades), we need to be clear about (c) how we should not analyze this situation. Given that all three (in their general form) have been my obsessions, I have been reflecting on them deeply, seriously and systematically for some time now. I would like to share some of the results of this reflection. In the first part, I will take a (rather slow) run up to tackling the third issue first. And even here, I look at RISA lila as an exemplification of a more general issue or as an expression of a much broader tendency.\nI. How not to analyze?\nPerhaps, it is best to begin in an autobiographical mode. I came to (continental) Europe some 25 years ago, naively thinking that \u0026lsquo;cultural difference\u0026rsquo; is something that \u0026lsquo;cosmopolitan\u0026rsquo; Indians would not experience: after all, I had studied natural sciences in India; knew English rather well; was more familiar with the British and European history than I was with that of India (I once had plans to join the IAS by doing exams on these subjects); felt right at home with the Western philosophy … It took me about 4 years of living in Europe, without relating to any Indian (or even Asian) community because I did not want to land up in an emotional and social ghetto, to realize that I was wrong: \u0026lsquo;cultural differences\u0026rsquo; were no fictitious invention of anthropologists; it involved more than being a vegetarian or being barefoot at home when the weather was not too cold. This realization was instrumental in shaping my research project: what makes the Indian culture different from that of the West? (I never felt anything other than an Indian amongst the Europeans.)\nI began to research this issue with some vague hunches and intuitions as my reference points: there was no literature to guide me in my endeavor. Of course, the first fields I went into were Indology and Anthropology. Pretty soon I discovered that neither was of any use. Not only did they fail to provide me with any insights, but they also succeeded in merely enraging me: the kind of rage you feel when you read the analyses of Wendy Doniger or Kripal. Indology is full of \u0026lsquo;insights\u0026rsquo; like those you have read in Rajiv\u0026rsquo;s article. What has varied over time is the intellectual jargon that clothes these \u0026lsquo;analyses\u0026rsquo;. Going deeper into the history of these disciplines (with respect to India) drove home some lessons very deeply: in both form and content, there was pretty little to differentiate between the Christian missionary reports of the 18th to 20th centuries and the Indological tracts. And that between a Herder and a Goethe on the one hand (the German Romantics who \u0026lsquo;praised\u0026rsquo; India while being derogatory about it at the same time) and a James Mill and an Abbé Dubois on the other, there was not much of a space to draw a dividing line. Researching further, I discovered that these \u0026lsquo;Indological truths\u0026rsquo; were enshrined in the \u0026lsquo;modern\u0026rsquo; social sciences: whether you read along with a Max Weber on \u0026rsquo; The Religions of India\u0026rsquo; or thought along with a Karl Marx on the \u0026lsquo;Asiatic mode of production\u0026rsquo; or even disagreed with the omnipresent \u0026lsquo;Oriental Despotism\u0026rsquo; of a Karl Wittfogel. Modern psychoanalysis of India, beginning with Carstair\u0026rsquo;s \u0026lsquo;The Twice Born\u0026rsquo; through \u0026lsquo;The Oceanic Feeling\u0026rsquo; of Mussaief-Masson (another Indologist using psychoanalysis to understand Indian religions), had already told our tale: Indian culture was \u0026rsquo;narcissistic\u0026rsquo; (in the sense of \u0026lsquo;secondary narcissism\u0026rsquo;) and thus pathological in nature.\nMy initial reactions to these discoveries were: horror, rage and a conviction that \u0026lsquo;racism\u0026rsquo; is inherent in these writings. Pretty soon, this conviction about \u0026lsquo;racism\u0026rsquo; of European authors gave way to doubts: Is it possible to convict all European authors of racism? Are we to assume that, in the last 400 years or so, all writers who wrote on India were racists? If yes, how to understand the powerful impact these writers and their theories have had on the Indian authors and Indian social sciences? If no, why did they say pretty similar things? Is one to say that the \u0026lsquo;respected\u0026rsquo; Indian social scientists are no better than brown sahibs? Is Indian social science merely a disguised variant of Indology? So on and so forth.\nToday, many of us are familiar with Edward Said and his book \u0026lsquo;Orientalism\u0026rsquo;. In his wake, many buzz-words like \u0026rsquo;essentialism\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;Eurocentrism\u0026rsquo; (though interesting, Blaut is not theoretically well-equipped), \u0026lsquo;Orientalist discourse\u0026rsquo;, the \u0026lsquo;us-them dichotomy\u0026rsquo; etc. whiz around. I would be the last to detract from the merits of Said\u0026rsquo;s book: he was one of the earliest writers to have drawn attention to the systematic nature of the western way of talking about the Orient. Despite this, the concept \u0026lsquo;Orientalism\u0026rsquo; is totally inadequate to analyze the situation underlying RISA lila. Surely, the question is: Why is the West Orientalist? Said\u0026rsquo;s plea ends up denying any possibility of understanding cultural differences or indeed why Orientalism came into being, or what sustains it. To say, as the \u0026lsquo;post-colonials\u0026rsquo; do, that the relation between \u0026lsquo;power/knowledge\u0026rsquo; answers this question is to make a mystique of the dyad of Foucault as though it \u0026rsquo;explains\u0026rsquo; anything. If this buzzword does anything at all, it helps us \u0026rsquo;explain\u0026rsquo; why the \u0026lsquo;post-colonials\u0026rsquo; earn a good living in the States: they talk the talk of their employees, and walk the walk of their patrons. (This is not to deny that there are genuine and committed people among them, or even to deny that they want to address themselves to genuine and urgent issues. It is only to draw attention to the phenomenon of \u0026lsquo;post-colonialism\u0026rsquo;.)\nWhat I am saying is that one should not think that these paintings are \u0026lsquo;racist\u0026rsquo;, or \u0026lsquo;orientalist\u0026rsquo; or a \u0026rsquo;eurocentric\u0026rsquo; . These words obfuscate the deeper issue, one which is more insidious than any of the above three. It might or might not be the case that Wendy and her children are \u0026lsquo;racist\u0026rsquo;; ditto about their \u0026rsquo;eurocentrism\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;orientalism\u0026rsquo;. But when you realize that they are not saying anything that has not been said in the last three hundred years (despite their fancy jargon), the question becomes: why does the western culture systematically portray India in these terms? To say that western culture is, in toto, racist or \u0026rsquo;eurocentric\u0026rsquo; is to say pretty little: even assuming, counterfactually, that the western culture is all these things (and that all the westerners are \u0026lsquo;racist\u0026rsquo;, etc), why do these attitudes persist, reproduce themselves and infect the Indians?\nThere is a weightier reason not to tread this path. In fact, it has been a typical characteristic of western writings on other cultures (including India) to characterize the latter using terms that are only appropriate to describe individual psychologies: X culture is stupid, degenerate, and irrational; Y culture is childish, immature, intuitive, feminine, etc. To simply repeat these mantras after them is to achieve very little understanding.\nMany say repeatedly that these writings \u0026lsquo;deny agency to the Indian subjects\u0026rsquo;. I am familiar with this phrase through \u0026lsquo;post-colonial\u0026rsquo; writings. This too is a mantra; like many of them, without having the desired effect. And why is that? It might appear to make sense if we merely restrict ourselves to Wendy and her children\u0026rsquo;s analyses of Ganesha, Shiva or Ramakrishna Paramahamsa. However, it loses all plausibility when we realize that, for instance, social sciences use one and the same \u0026rsquo;epistemology\u0026rsquo; to analyze both the west and India and that despite this, their claims about India reproduce the \u0026lsquo;Indological truths.\u0026rsquo; (Those who do not believe me are invited to dip, for example, into those multiple theories of \u0026rsquo;the Indian Caste System\u0026rsquo;: from the sociobiological theories of a Van den Berghe - a sociologist - through the social choice theories of an Olson jr. - an economist-cum-political scientist. Even a book that wants to criticize the writings that \u0026lsquo;deny agency\u0026rsquo; to the Indians, \u0026lsquo;Castes of Mind\u0026rsquo; of Nicholas Dirks, ends up doing nothing else than \u0026lsquo;deny agency to the Indians\u0026rsquo;.) Quite clearly, \u0026rsquo;the problem\u0026rsquo; cannot be solved by \u0026lsquo;discovering\u0026rsquo; some or another pet epistemology (like Ronald Inden does, in appealing to Collingwood).\nIn a way, one could say, we need to do to the west what it has done to us, namely, study it anthropologically. But how to go about doing this and not simply reproduce what generations of thinkers (from the west) have already said about the West? It is amusing to use Freud to analyze their Freudian analyses of Indian religions; or use Patanjali\u0026rsquo;s Chakras to typify their personalities. But at the end of the day, we are still left with the task of studying and understanding why the western culture talks about us the way it does.\nIn other words, it would be a conceptual blunder to look either at Wendy or her children as exponents of racism, eurocentrism or even Orientalism alone. (They might be any or all the three. But that does not really matter.) We need to realize that they are doing two things simultaneously: drawing upon the existing social sciences and also contributing to their further \u0026lsquo;development\u0026rsquo;.\nI will explain the significance of the last sentence later. For the present, let me just say this: our problems do not either begin or end in religious studies or Indology. They are deeper. Much, much deeper. To tackle RISA lila as a separate phenomenon, i.e., to focus either on Wendy or her parampara alone, would be to compound tragedy with conceptual blunder. Not only that. It would prevent us from understanding RISA lila for what it is: a phenomenon that is typical of the western culture.\nII. How to analyze social sciences: Secularization\nEarlier, I drew attention to the fact that Wendy and her children draw from the existing social sciences, while contributing at the same time to their further \u0026lsquo;development\u0026rsquo;. In this post, I will elaborate what this statement means, what it implies, and what it says about the \u0026lsquo;western culture\u0026rsquo;. Let me see how far I can go in this post with respect to the objective without being inordinately long. However, it is only fair that I warn you beforehand: I will only be able to isolate an important thread; within the confines of this post, I cannot prove my claims. (To those interested in \u0026lsquo;proofs\u0026rsquo;, I refer them to my book.)\nNot many would challenge the claim that Christianity has been highly influential in the development of the western culture. We need to take this statement utterly seriously. It means that many things we \u0026rsquo;take for granted\u0026rsquo;, whether in the West or in India, come from the influence that Christianity has exerted. I claim that Christianity expands in two ways. (This is not just typical of Christianity but of all religions. I will talk only of Christianity because I want to talk about the western culture.) Both of these have been present ever since the inception of Christianity and have mutually reinforced each other. The first is familiar to all of us: direct conversion. People from other cultures and \u0026lsquo;religions\u0026rsquo; are explicitly converted to Christianity and thus the community of Christian believers grows. This is the \u0026lsquo;surface\u0026rsquo; or explicit expansion of Christianity. In India, both in the colonial and modern times, this has been a theme of intense controversy but, according to me, not of very great consequence when compared to the second way Christianity also expands.\nFunnily enough, the second way in which Christianity expands is also familiar to us: the process secularization. I claim that Christianity \u0026lsquo;secularizes\u0026rsquo; itself in the form of, as it were, \u0026lsquo;dechristianised Christainity\u0026rsquo;. What this word means is: typically Christian doctrines spread wide and deep (beyond the confines of the community of Christian believers) in the society dressed up in \u0026lsquo;secular\u0026rsquo; (that is, not in recognizably \u0026lsquo;Christian\u0026rsquo;) clothes. We need a very small bit of Western history here in order to understand this point better. 2.1. Usually, the \u0026rsquo;enlightenment period\u0026rsquo;, which is identified as \u0026rsquo;the Age of Reason\u0026rsquo;, is alleged to be the apotheosis (or the \u0026lsquo;high point\u0026rsquo;) of the process of \u0026lsquo;secularization\u0026rsquo;. What people normally mean by \u0026lsquo;secularization\u0026rsquo; here is the following: the enlightenment thinkers are supposed to have successfully \u0026lsquo;fought\u0026rsquo; against the dominance that religion (i.e. Christianity) had until then exercised over social, political, and economic life. From then on, so goes the standard text book story, human kind began to look to \u0026lsquo;reason\u0026rsquo; instead of, say, the Church in all matters social, civic, political etc. The spirit of scientific thinking, which dominated that age, has continued to gain ascendancy. As heirs to this period, which put a definitive end to all forms of \u0026lsquo;irrational\u0026rsquo; subservience, we are proud citizens of the modern day world. We are against all forms of despotism and we are believers in democracy; we believe in the role of reason in social life; we recognize the value of human rights; and we should understand that \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo; is not a matter for state intervention, but a \u0026lsquo;private\u0026rsquo; and personal affair of the individual in question. This, as I say, is the standard text book story.\n2.2. The problem with this story is simply this: the enlightenment thinkers have built their formidable reputation (as opponents of \u0026lsquo;all organized religion\u0026rsquo; or even \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo; tout court) by selling ideas from Protestant Christianity as though they were \u0026rsquo;neutral\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;rational\u0026rsquo;. Take for example the claim that \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo; is not a matter for state intervention and that it is a \u0026lsquo;private\u0026rsquo; affair of the individual in question. (Indian \u0026lsquo;secularists\u0026rsquo; agitatedly jump and down to \u0026lsquo;defend\u0026rsquo; this idea.) Who thought, do you think, that \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo; was not a \u0026lsquo;private\u0026rsquo; affair? The Catholic Church, of course. Even to this day, it believes that you should believe what the Church says, and that because the Church mediates between Man and God, what you believe in (as a Christian) is decided by the Catholic Church. The Protestants fought a battle with the Catholics on theological grounds: they argued that \u0026lsquo;being a Christian believer\u0026rsquo; (or what the Christian believes in) is matter between the Maker (i.e. God) and the Individual. It was God (i.e. the Christian God), who judged man; and men could not judge each other in matters of Christian faith. The Church, they argued, could not mediate between Man and God (according to their interpretation of the Bible); the Catholic Church argued that men could not, using only their reasoning and interpretative abilities, interpret the Word of God (i.e. the Bible). To think so is to be seduced by the Devil, and the only guarantee against the seduction by the Devil and eternal damnation was the Church itself and its interpretation of the Bible. (There is a famous doctrine of the Catholic Church, which says, \u0026lsquo;Extra ecclesiam nulla salus\u0026rsquo;: there is no salvation - i.e. being saved from the clutches of the Devil - outside the Church.) To cut the long story short, the Protestants won this theological battle. The enlightenment thinkers repeated this Protestant story, and this has become our \u0026lsquo;secularism\u0026rsquo;.\n2.3. The same story applies with respect to what is enshrined in the UN charter. The doctrine of Human Rights (as we know them today) arose in the Middle Ages, when the Franciscans and the Dominicans fought each other. (Both are religious orders within the Catholic Church.) All theories of human rights we know today were elaborated in this struggle that continued nearly for two hundred years. They were theological debates, to understand which one needs to understand Christian theology. (Just take my word for it for now.) When John Locke (a British philosopher) started talking about \u0026lsquo;Natural Rights\u0026rsquo; in the 18th century, he was simply regurgitating a theological debate within Christianity.\n2.4. I am not merely making the point that these ideas had their origin in religious contexts. My point is much more than that: I claim that we cannot accept these theories without, at the same time, accepting Christian theology as true. What the western thinkers have done over the centuries (the Enlightenment period is the best known for being the \u0026lsquo;high point\u0026rsquo; of this process) is to dress up Christian theological ideas (I am blurring the distinction between the divisions within Christianity) in a secular mantle. Not just this or that isolated idea, but theological theories themselves.\n2.5. I am not in the least suggesting that this is some kind of a conspiracy. I am merely explicating what I mean when I say that Christianity spreads also through the process of secularization. What have been secularized are whole sets of ideas about Man and Society which I call \u0026lsquo;Biblical themes\u0026rsquo;. They are Biblical themes because to accept them is to accept the truth of the Bible. Most of our so-called \u0026lsquo;social sciences\u0026rsquo; assume the truth of these Biblical themes.\n2.6. I know this sounds unbelievable; but I have started to prove them. I have already shown, for example, that the so-called religious studies presuppose the truth of Christian theology. That is why, when they study the so-called \u0026lsquo;religions\u0026rsquo; from other cultures, their results do not fundamentally differ from a theological treatment of the same religions. In the book I am now writing on ethics, I am able to show the same: the so-called secular ethics are \u0026lsquo;secularizations\u0026rsquo; of Christian ethics. That is why, according to the modern \u0026lsquo;secular\u0026rsquo; ethics, we are either \u0026lsquo;immoral\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;moral cretins\u0026rsquo;. According to the Christianity, only the \u0026rsquo;true\u0026rsquo; religion can provide a foundation for ethical behavior: the Heathens and the Pagans, because they worship the Devil, are either immoral or intellectually weak. Even in psychology, the notion of the development of \u0026lsquo;person\u0026rsquo; (or \u0026lsquo;self\u0026rsquo;) is a non-trivial secularization of the Christian notion of \u0026lsquo;soul\u0026rsquo;. So I can go on, but I will not. Instead of convincing you, such a list might end up generating disbelief.\nTo begin to appreciate the plausibility (if not the truth) of my claim, ask yourselves the following question: why are the so-called \u0026lsquo;social sciences\u0026rsquo; different from the natural sciences? I mean to say, why have the social sciences not developed the way natural sciences have? There must have been many geniuses in the social sciences; the mathematical and logical sophistication in some of the social sciences is simply mind-bending; we have computers and we can simulate almost anything. Comparatively speaking, it is not as though the social sciences are starved of funding or personnel. Despite all this, the social sciences are not progressing. Why is this? (When you have, say, a problem in a love-relationship, you do not open a text book on psychology; you look for a wise friend or an understanding uncle.) There are many answers provided in the history of philosophy and many of you may have your own \u0026lsquo;favorite\u0026rsquo; explanation. Here is my answer: you cannot build a scientific theory based on theological assumptions. What you will get then is not a scientific theory, but an embroidering of theology. I put to you that this is what has happened. Most of our so-called social sciences are not \u0026lsquo;sciences\u0026rsquo; in any sense of the term: they are merely bad Christian theologies.\nIf this is true, it also helps us understand why both \u0026lsquo;conversion\u0026rsquo; and the notion of \u0026lsquo;secularism\u0026rsquo; jar Indian sensibilities. Somehow or the other, Nehruvian \u0026lsquo;secularism\u0026rsquo; always connotes a denigration of Indian traditions; if you look at the debates in the EPW and SEMINAR and journals like that, one thing is very clear: none of the participants really understands what \u0026lsquo;secularism\u0026rsquo; means. In India, \u0026lsquo;secularism\u0026rsquo; is counter posed to \u0026lsquo;communalism\u0026rsquo;; whereas \u0026rsquo;the secular\u0026rsquo;, in European languages, has only one contrast: \u0026rsquo;the sacred\u0026rsquo;. Now, of course, I do not want to make much out of this; but I thought that it would be interesting to draw your attention to this interesting fact.\nTo summarize what I have said so far. Christianity spreads in two ways: through conversion and through secularization. The modern day social sciences embody the assumptions of Christian theology, albeit in a \u0026lsquo;secularized\u0026rsquo; form. That is why when Wendy and her children draw upon the resources of the existing social sciences, they are drawing upon Christian theology. In this Christian theology, we are worshippers of the Devil. Our gods are demons (followers of the devil). As such, amongst other things, they are perverts: sexually, morally and intellectually. The worshippers of the Devil (which is what we are) are also perverts: why otherwise would we follow the Devil or his minions? Even if Wendy and her children oppose a straightforward Christian understanding openly (because of their genuine conviction), their conclusions are no different from the simplistic story I have just sketched. How can they be driven to embrace Christian theology, even when they either openly reject it or when they know nothing of it? This will be one of the questions I will take up in my future posts, assuming that people remain interested.\nThis is the insidious process I talked about earlier: the process of secularization of Christian ideas. I have not been able to do justice to the richness of this process: an inevitable price one pays for condensing complex analyses into short posts. Let the \u0026lsquo;simplistic\u0026rsquo; presentation not lead you to think that the ideas I am proposing are \u0026lsquo;simplistic\u0026rsquo;. They are not.\nWhy do we, the Indian intellectuals, not see this secularization straight away? Why is the process of secularization not visible to the western intellectuals? These are some of the obvious questions I will tackle.\nIII. Why Secularization not \u0026lsquo;visible\u0026rsquo; to the Western intellectuals?\nIn a way, the answer can be provided in a single sentence: the research questions and the research framework of many-a-social science were set up explicitly by Christian theologians using the resources of Christian theology. (I am using \u0026rsquo;theology\u0026rsquo; as a general term here.) Both the questions and answers have retained their intelligibility, even though the \u0026rsquo;explicit\u0026rsquo; theology has faded into the background. A theological question does not cease to be theological just because the one who answers it does not know much about theology. The very fact that such questions make sense at all (and do not appear nonsensical) is the proof of the fact that the questioner remains within the ambit of a religious framework. (If you have no clue about Physics, the question \u0026lsquo;when does some stellar object become a quasar?\u0026rsquo; will not make much sense. To answer it, if you can answer it at all, you need to draw upon the resources of theories in Physics.) However, this single sentence answer fails to capture the complexity and diversity of the process. Therefore, let me just illustrate what this process really means, or has meant. (I will be taking random examples, and of different kinds just to indicate the depth of the process. If one intends doing more than this, one will have to write umpteen books!)\nConsider, to begin with, the very notion \u0026rsquo;the west\u0026rsquo; or \u0026rsquo;the western culture\u0026rsquo;. During the first 800 years (after the year 300 C.E. - \u0026lsquo;Common Era\u0026rsquo;, which replaces AD that meant the year of the Lord, Anno Domini), it was \u0026lsquo;Eastern Christianity\u0026rsquo; (i.e. the Christianity of the Byzantine Empire with its centre in Constantinople) that dominated the Christian communities. The Church in Rome was merely one of the churches within Christianity. The \u0026rsquo;evangelization\u0026rsquo; of Europe really begins in earnest after 900 C.E. This was a process launched by the Church in Rome, and it occurred in areas to \u0026rsquo;the west\u0026rsquo; of Rome. For this reason, this Christianity came to be called \u0026lsquo;Western Christianity\u0026rsquo; and the emergence of this Christendom to the west of Rome is the emergence of \u0026rsquo;the West\u0026rsquo;.\nConsider these two famous research questions about the \u0026rsquo;transition\u0026rsquo; in history (of both the \u0026rsquo;leftist\u0026rsquo; and the \u0026lsquo;rightist\u0026rsquo; variety): when and how did transition from \u0026lsquo;slavery\u0026rsquo; to \u0026lsquo;feudalism\u0026rsquo; occur in Europe? This issue was discussed by theologians and theological historians for a long time in the following form: how did Christianity put an end to the Pagan Rome? The historians discussed precisely this issue, and in this form, till the end of the eighteenth century as well. The division they made between \u0026rsquo;epochs\u0026rsquo; (a word coined by a French Christian Priest called Bossuet during the 18th century) was the one between pre-Christian (pagan) Rome and the post-Christian Rome. The very same issue, with the very same division has now become a \u0026lsquo;scientific\u0026rsquo; question in the guise of: how did feudalism put paid to slavery? The same can be said about another transition question that bothers Marxist historians: how did feudalism (an \u0026rsquo;epoch\u0026rsquo; of social production) give way to Capitalism in \u0026rsquo;the West\u0026rsquo;? Do you know what this question is a complex translation of? \u0026lsquo;Why did the Protestant reformation against the Catholic Church gain foothold?\u0026rsquo;\nConsider the emergence of the Legal System in the western culture. Its origin does not lie in the Roman Law but in the Church. The theologians of the Roman Catholic Church turned to the Roman jurists in their attempts to build a legal structure for the Church. (This is called the famous \u0026lsquo;Gregorian reformation\u0026rsquo; of the Catholic Church.) Thus a complex system of laws and their justifications (including terms that are fundamental to the modern jurisprudence) arose, called \u0026lsquo;The Canon Law\u0026rsquo;. The \u0026lsquo;Civil Law\u0026rsquo; (using this as a general term) was built by the theologians by modeling it after the Canon Law. Till the 18th century, \u0026rsquo;the faculty of law\u0026rsquo; was a part of the \u0026lsquo;faculty of theology\u0026rsquo; in the western universities and taught only by theologians. To this day, in many universities in Europe this theological heritage is still maintained in the way the law faculties are called: \u0026lsquo;Rechtenfaculteit\u0026rsquo; (\u0026lsquo;Rechten\u0026rsquo; is the plural of \u0026lsquo;Das Recht\u0026rsquo;), referring to the two laws - the canon law and civil law.\nConsider too, for example, one of the notions fundamental to Modern Jurisprudence: \u0026lsquo;will\u0026rsquo;. There have been umpteen discussions about this notion in Philosophy, Law, Psychology, etc. Clearly, or so we think, human beings have a will and exercise it as well. What is the origin of this picture of human beings? Till 300 B.C.E. this notion was \u0026lsquo;absent\u0026rsquo; in what we call the western culture today. Neither the Greek thinkers (like Plato or Aristotle), nor the Roman jurists (who wrote their law digests) had such a notion or such a picture of human beings. The first person to struggle with this notion and write tracts about it was Saint Augustine, one of the most influential Fathers of the Christian Church. Why did the Christians find this notion important? Because, they think, the universe exemplifies the Will of God and human beings should subordinate themselves to this Will. That is to say, the human will must subordinate itself to the divine will. What is human \u0026lsquo;will\u0026rsquo; then? What does this subordination consist of? These and many similar questions arose within the ambit of Christian theology, presupposing a Christian picture of Man. (A picture that was neither Greek nor Roman, and is definitely not Indian.) Yet, how many of us do not practice Law, read and write about human will and even assume as an empirical fact that it is in the nature of being human that we have will? (This is no fact, but a Christian theological picture of man.)\nTake, as another kind of an example, the issue of \u0026lsquo;freedom\u0026rsquo;. This issue is a central one in Philosophy, in moral theories, in political theories (about State and society), in legal theories, and psychological theories, etc. If you were to blandly state this issue in a single sentence: it is a good thing that people are \u0026lsquo;free\u0026rsquo; and that every one \u0026lsquo;ought\u0026rsquo; to be \u0026lsquo;free\u0026rsquo;. In ethical theories, for instance, a moral action is an action of choice, made freely without coercion. In fact, in the absence of \u0026lsquo;freedom\u0026rsquo; morality is not possible. Let me just draw a contrast between this way of thinking (which appears to be true on the basis of \u0026lsquo;universal consent\u0026rsquo;) and our ideas about \u0026lsquo;karma\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;rebirth\u0026rsquo;. (You need not assume the \u0026rsquo;truth\u0026rsquo; of punarjanma in order to follow my point.) If the fruits of one\u0026rsquo;s action do not track (very strictly) the agent across several lives, the idea of both \u0026lsquo;Karma\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;rebirth\u0026rsquo; become senseless. Somehow or the other, these notions are parts of our (i.e. Indian) understanding of morality. That means to say, if there was no binding and strict determinism, ethics is impossible. Here, then, the contrast: according to the western culture, moral action is impossible if it is not \u0026lsquo;free\u0026rsquo;; according to us, without strict determinism, moral action is impossible. Yet, how many of us do not act as though \u0026lsquo;freedom\u0026rsquo; is a \u0026lsquo;self-explanatory\u0026rsquo; concept? Do you know what the origins (it has multiple theological loci) of this problem are? God created Man and gave him the \u0026lsquo;freedom\u0026rsquo; to choose between God and the Devil. (In secularized terms, between \u0026lsquo;good\u0026rsquo; and \u0026rsquo;evil\u0026rsquo;.) The possibility of \u0026lsquo;salvation\u0026rsquo; (i.e. of being \u0026lsquo;saved\u0026rsquo; from the clutches of the Devil) depended on this \u0026lsquo;free choice\u0026rsquo;. Therefore, theological issues arose: What then does \u0026lsquo;human freedom\u0026rsquo; mean? Why did God give \u0026lsquo;freedom\u0026rsquo; to man? Are we \u0026lsquo;condemned\u0026rsquo; to be \u0026lsquo;free\u0026rsquo;? etc. etc. Our svatantra does not mean \u0026lsquo;freedom\u0026rsquo; as its contrast term paratantra indicates. Our \u0026lsquo;gods\u0026rsquo; are sarva tantra svatantara, i.e. beings for whom all tantras are their \u0026lsquo;own\u0026rsquo; (sva). What exactly are we doing then, when we discuss about a \u0026lsquo;free society\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;freedom\u0026rsquo; of individuals, etc, etc?\nInstead of carrying on in this vein let me round off in a different way. Fundamental to Christianity is its belief that there \u0026lsquo;ought\u0026rsquo; to be scriptural sanction for actions in the world. In other words, this religion makes one seek scriptural foundations for one\u0026rsquo;s actions (whether for \u0026lsquo;sacred\u0026rsquo; ones like \u0026lsquo;worshipping\u0026rsquo; or to \u0026lsquo;secular\u0026rsquo; ones like the attitude one should take regarding \u0026lsquo;strangers\u0026rsquo; ). The scripture is one kind of \u0026lsquo;revelation\u0026rsquo; of God\u0026rsquo;s will; the Nature also reveals God\u0026rsquo;s Will. One studies both in order to find out what God Wills so that one may become a part of God\u0026rsquo;s purposes (for human kind) on earth. The Church, as a social organism, confronted many social and political problems during its history. Whether it was a revolt of the peasants, or a fight with the monarchs about the nature of political authority, these phenomena were conceptualized as problems within theology. That is to say, both the way the Church formulated the problem and its responses were founded on the scriptures (and the writings of t he church fathers). The problem of state and society, the limits of political power, etc. were actual issues that the Church confronted. The way it formulated these issues and the kind of answers it sought, etc. were theological in nature. These very same questions and answers (and the underlying framework) have been taken over by the so-called social sciences. So, when they further go on along this track, all they are doing is further embroider Christian theology. No matter what they think they are doing, they are not doing science. Even when they speak of things that become totally nonsensical, if and when explicit theology is left out, they continue to talk as though it makes sense.\nFor an example of this sort, take the notion of \u0026lsquo;polytheism\u0026rsquo; that anthropology of religion, practitioners of \u0026lsquo;religious studies\u0026rsquo;, sociologists, etc. use. This notion is contradictio in terminis, that is to say, it is internally contradictory. \u0026lsquo;Polytheism\u0026rsquo; refers to a doctrine that countenances multiple \u0026lsquo;gods\u0026rsquo;. What does it mean to speak of multiple \u0026lsquo;gods\u0026rsquo;? It is to say that there is more than one \u0026lsquo;God\u0026rsquo;. (There must be at least two). However, who or what is \u0026lsquo;God\u0026rsquo; that there may be more than one? If, in order to answer this question, one refers to the meaning of this word, unsurprisingly it turns out, the dictionary meaning is also the meaning of Christian religion. Amongst other things, \u0026lsquo;God\u0026rsquo; is the creator of the universe. If this is what God means, there cannot be more than one \u0026lsquo;God\u0026rsquo;. (How can one make sense of the statement that there are multiple \u0026lsquo;creators\u0026rsquo;, when \u0026lsquo;God\u0026rsquo; refers to that being which created the Universe?) How, then, can one speak of \u0026lsquo;polytheism\u0026rsquo;? Only if one assumes that there is one \u0026lsquo;God\u0026rsquo; and some several other creatures who are other than this \u0026lsquo;God\u0026rsquo; and yet claim the status of \u0026lsquo;godhood\u0026rsquo;. The claim of such creatures must be false: because the very definition of \u0026lsquo;God\u0026rsquo; attributes this status to only one entity. Or, there must be one \u0026rsquo;true\u0026rsquo; God, and many \u0026lsquo;false\u0026rsquo; gods, who are different from and other than the True One. This is precisely what Christian theology says: there is but one \u0026rsquo;true\u0026rsquo; God, and there are many \u0026lsquo;false\u0026rsquo; gods (the Devil and his minions). A \u0026lsquo;Polytheist\u0026rsquo;, then, worships these multiple \u0026lsquo;gods\u0026rsquo; (and not the True One). That is to say, a polytheist is a \u0026lsquo;heathen\u0026rsquo; who worships the devil. This is what Christianity said of the Roman religions, the Greek religions, the Indian \u0026lsquo;religions\u0026rsquo;, etc. How is it possible that \u0026lsquo;scientific\u0026rsquo; studies take over the word \u0026lsquo;polytheism\u0026rsquo; and blithely use it without recognizing that it is senseless to do so without assuming the truth of Christian theology?\nWhat I am saying, in other words, is that the western intellectuals are blind to secularized theology, because that is all they know. This is their tool, and they have no other. Only when we develop alternate manners of theorizing about Man and Society will they too be able to see the theological nature of their thinking. Until such stage, all they can do is to ridicule the suggestion that they are merely embroidering theology.\nThe process of secularization of Christianity is complex, rich and varied. In each of the domains I have researched, the form of secularization of theology has been different. The routes travelled have been varied: but the results have been the same. But this should not transform my suggestion into a mantra. We need to plot out the rich and varied contours of the process of secularizing of Christianity. When we do so, we will truly be initiating a revolution in human thinking: at last, one can begin to speak in terms of the sciences of the social. Until such stage, all we have are bad Christian theologies masquerading as \u0026lsquo;social sciences\u0026rsquo;.\nIV. What should be done?\nThus far we have seen that the western representations of India do not so much express the perfidious intentions (or subconscious desires) of the writers as much as the secularized Christian theology that guides research. If this is true, there arise other questions that beg clarification: what, then, could we say about the Indian writings in Indology, sociology, etc? Are the Indian writers too not influenced, whether directly or indirectly, by the very same \u0026rsquo;theories\u0026rsquo; that incorporate the secularized Christian theology? If they are, surely, there will be but a thin dividing line between the Indian representations of India and the western ones. If they are not, how could they be impervious to and unaffected by secularized Christian theories, while their western colleagues are? Despite the enormous importance of this theme, I shall leave it aside for now.\nIn explaining the obliviousness of western thinkers to their acceptance of secularized theology, I suggested that only when we present alternate ways of describing the world could they gain insight to the theological nature of their endeavor. If this diagnosis stands up to scrutiny, our task is also clear: start working towards the goal of building such theories. In the last two decades, I have come to the realization that there is far more to this task than is apparent at first sight. My ideas on this matter have evolved not only by studying histories and sociologies of science (about how theories grow, get propagated and get accepted) but also by appreciating the complexity of the task while trying to carry it out. Here, I want to share some of my thoughts on this subject.\nLet me begin by picking up an obvious question: Why should we be bothered to carry this task out (and all that it entails) at all? Of course, no one is or can ever be compelled to carry this task out. Yet, there is a partial answer that can go some way in meeting the real concern behind this problem. Because of reasons of space, let me make talk about Indian culture as an entity and about its experiments to provide some semblance of an answer.\nImagine, if you will, that Indian culture is an entity and that all Indians are its members. Imagine too that one day, it realized that it was not sure any more about the nature of the world it inhabited: What should it be doing? What is its place? How should it adapt? What does adaptation consist of? The only way it can ever find answers to these questions is through experimentation: trying out this or that strategy, growing new things as and when needed. Only its members can help of help; they are the ones to experiment with. Let us agree not to ask further questions about how this culture came to this realization and that we do not dispute about dating this event: India\u0026rsquo;s independence from the British. Thus, this entity, the Indian culture, takes to massive experimentation telescoping, in this process, events of many decades elsewhere into a single decade (and sometimes even less) in its history. Let us chronicle these experiments.\nFirst, it takes to \u0026lsquo;socialism\u0026rsquo;: \u0026lsquo;Nehruvian\u0026rsquo; socialism, the socialism of Lohia, the socialist attempts of the communist parties of India. Just as these experiments take-off, this culture starts exploring their limits even before a new generation is born: the Naxalites and the ML movement in Bengal impact India\u0026rsquo;s youth in different parts of India and both socialisms (of Lohia and of Nehru) begin to crack under the pressure of events even as, in the late 60\u0026rsquo;s, people elsewhere in the world begin to discover \u0026lsquo;student power\u0026rsquo;. Many activist youth groups emerge in different parts of India, born outside the existing left, but already radicalized. Just as these groups appeared to run out of steam, the Indian culture paused, and as though considering, plunges into another massive experimentation: \u0026lsquo;Dalit\u0026rsquo; movement, \u0026lsquo;secessionist\u0026rsquo; movements, which pits not the bourgeoisies against the proletariat but groups against each other. Even as these impact the culture, through \u0026lsquo;reservation policies\u0026rsquo; and contraction of the living space for some of India\u0026rsquo;s children, a new experimentation begins: it is time for ratha yatra and Babri Masjid. This experimentation still continues and as it does, this entity launches yet another with no parallels in human history: the Indian culture sends two or more millions of its members to America. This is no exodus, much less of an exile, even if these members insist on speaking of the \u0026lsquo;Diaspora\u0026rsquo;.\nWhat has Indian culture found out through all these experiments? Some of India\u0026rsquo;s children still continue with these experiments; some have ceased doing so. This means either some answers are no answers at all or at best, partial ones. Is India \u0026lsquo;socialist\u0026rsquo;? Or is she the proletariat? Or, perhaps, the landless peasant? Is she the \u0026lsquo;Dalit\u0026rsquo;, or merely the \u0026lsquo;woman\u0026rsquo;? Has she always been a Sikh, a Tamil or a Marathi, and never a single entity? Is she a \u0026lsquo;Hindu\u0026rsquo;, a Muslim or merely \u0026lsquo;secular\u0026rsquo;? India, it appears, has been interrogating herself through all these experiments: who is she? This is no third-rate \u0026lsquo;identity politics\u0026rsquo; of the post-colonials taught in Chicago or Columbia, but the strivings of a culture. We, her children, express this striving as well. Whatever our individual motives, whatever our individual biographies, today, on this thread, we too are asking the same question: what is it to be an Indian?\nMuch like her, we cannot reject the past: without it, we are not who we are any more. Nor could we turn our back to the present: that is where we have to live. Our cultural past must be made to talk in the language of the present: that, I have discovered, is the task for the future. At this moment, however, we need to become aware that we are asking this question and that the answer matters to each one of us. That is why we should be bothered about carrying out the task I spoke of. What is involved in accomplishing this task? Here too the answer is simple: a collective effort. What does such an effort entail? I can share the results of my reflections on my experience in pursuing this task for nearly two decades now.\nThe first step, quite obviously, calls for spreading awareness about the nature of western representations of India. This entails that we find (a) people willing not only to challenge the western \u0026lsquo;scholars\u0026rsquo;, where and when they give talks in public forums about India etc. but also (b) speakers from the Indian community in the US, who try actively to supplant these \u0026lsquo;scholars\u0026rsquo;. This requires that such speakers are continuously fed with literature of two sorts: (a) a debunking kind; and (b) the sort which provides new and novel conceptualizations of many aspects of the Indian culture itself.\nThis suggests that a serious and systematic research must be undertaken by many different people on many different themes. My knowledge of the intellectual scene tells me that there are very few such people. So, one has to look at recruiting younger, gifted people into doing research.\nFor this to happen, we need three things: (a) an intellectual visibility and respectability for this kind of research so that fine, younger minds are attracted: (b) a reward system that makes it worthwhile for them to pursue such a research for a decade at least; (c) a training in not only doing such research, but also help in publishing them in highly visible journals so that they can then go on to populate chairs in the academia.\nParallel to doing all these, there is also the mammoth task of planting these seeds in the Indian soil itself. In order to appreciate the complexity of this task, we need to have some answers I raised in the first paragraph. Let us, therefore, leave this aspect of the enterprise out of this post for the moment.\nIf these things are to happen at all, it is obvious that we need an organization. Only such an entity can formulate such long term plans, translate them into viable strategies, and pursue them systematically.\nCan this be done? I personally believe so. We have the kind of brains we need: people who can strategize; those can build organizations: those who can raise finances; those who can go straight to the heart of a problem and represent it in simple terms; based on little material, those who anticipate and formulate central questions for enquiry; and, above all, an interested and concerned audience.\nIndia, today, is at a cross-road: she has been in many such cross-roads in the past, and she will be in many more in the future. Neither is relevant to us, because we can make a difference only to this one. We have the persons. We have the brains. We have the talents. We have the energy. We have the money. We have the instruments, the knowledge and the abilities. We have the capacity to create the know-how as we work on the project. What more do we need?\nI think our culture is going to see a renaissance. Such a renaissance will be of importance not just to us, Indians, but to the entire humankind. Because it is going to lay the real foundations for the sciences of the social and thus give a surprising answer to the question, \u0026lsquo;what is to be an Indian?\u0026rsquo; This process is going to take place: sooner, if we can accelerate the pace; later, if we do nothing about it. In the latter case, that event may not happen in your lifetime or mine; but happen it shall. Of this, I am utterly convinced. It is this conviction that has kept me going all these years; it is the same conviction that has made me want to reach out to those of you who have followed this discussion about RISA lila.\n","tags":["Jeffry Kripal","Paul Courtright","Wendy Doniger"],"title":"Negative portrayals of non-Western Cultures like Indian: Secularization of Christianity – S.N.
