      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the about page. Here you can write about yourself, your project, or your company. If you don&amp;rsquo;t have anything interesting to say about yourself, like me, you can always borrow words from wonderful people from the past :)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With  sufficient  imagination  a  man  could  write  a  whole  series  of   versions  of   his  life;  it  would  form  a  union  of   sets  in  which the facts would be the only elements in common. People, even  intelligent  people,  who  are  young,  and  therefore  inexperienced and naïve, see only cynicism in such a possibility. They are mistaken, because the problem is not moral but cognitive. The number of  metaphysical beliefs is no greater or less than the  number  of   different  beliefs  a  man  may  entertain  on  the  subject  of   himself—  sequentially,  at  various  periods  of   his  life,  and occasionally even at the same time. Therefore,  I  cannot  claim  to  offer  anything  other  than  the  &lt;em&gt;notions of  myself&lt;/em&gt;  that I have formed over the space of  roughly forty  years,  and  their  only  singularity,  it  seems  to  me,  is  that  &lt;strong&gt;they are not flattering&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
