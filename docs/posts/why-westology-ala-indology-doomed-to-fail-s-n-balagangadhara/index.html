      <div class="post-content">
        <p>1.1. The inherent logic of such an enterprise forces one, as it were, to build <em>alternate</em> theories to the existing, &lsquo;western&rsquo; theories. Instead of explaining this statement in the abstract, let me take a concrete example to illustrate what I mean.</p>
<p>1.2. In the University of Chicago, there is a certain Richard Shweder. He practices &lsquo;Cultural Psychology&rsquo;, and is (was?) professor of &lsquo;Human Development&rsquo;. He is rather well-known for his &lsquo;cross-cultural&rsquo; studies: he and his students have published many works comparing psychological developments across the two cultures that India and America are. (In fact, he received a medal from the American Association of the Advancement of Science, if I remember properly, for one of his articles: &lsquo;Does the concept of the Person vary cross-culturally?&rsquo; This was a study about the concept of &lsquo;self&rsquo; in the USA and Orissa, India.) A few years ago, he published a study on the nature of <em>moral development</em> and the growth of moral awareness cross-culturally: again, India and the USA were the two compared cultures.</p>
<p>1.3. To study this, Shweder and his co-workers developed a questionnaire supposed to test the presence of several moral notions among their subjects. (This article is called &ldquo;Culture and Moral Development&rsquo;, by Richard Shweder, Manamohan Mahapatra and Joan G. Miller. A convenient reprint is to be found in &ldquo;Cultural Psychology: Essays on Comparative Human Development, Eds., James Stigler, Richard Shweder and Gibert Herdt, Cambridge University Press, 1990, Pp.130-204. I will cite from this work.) The interviewees are both children and adults. From the list of the cases that Shweder uses, here are the first five - in order of <em>perceived</em> &lsquo;seriousness of breach&rsquo;, as judged by Hindu Brahman eight-to ten-year-olds:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The day after his father&rsquo;s death, the eldest son had a haircut and ate chicken.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One of your family members eats beef regularly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One of your family members eats a dog regularly for dinner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A widow in your community eats fish two or three times a week.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Six months after the death of her husband, the widow wore jewellery and bright-colored clothes (Ibid. p.165).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It is important to note that, in India, while there was a consensus between the children and the adults regarding the first two cases (p.184), there was a lack of consensus only among children regarding the last three cases. Keeping in mind that they are ordered in terms of the &lsquo;perceived seriousness of the breach&rsquo;, we further come across (ibid., P.165):</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>After defecation (making a bowel movement) a woman did not change her clothes before cooking.</li>
</ol>
<p>13.In a family, a twenty-five-year-old son addresses his father by his first name.</p>
<p>And, as the fifteenth, &ldquo;a poor man went to the hospital after being seriously hurt in an accident. At the hospital they refused to treat him because he could not afford to pay (ibid).&rdquo;</p>
<p>1.4. We can, I suppose, grant the truth of these statements. We can grant too that many Indians (both children and adults) would probably consider such actions not just as <em>paap</em> but as <em>mahapaap</em>. If not &lsquo;sins&rsquo;, they are at least some kind of &rsquo;ethical transgressions&rsquo; and not mere breaches of social etiquette. As the sequence of questions in the interview makes it clear, the respondents were asked to motivate (or clarify) their stance. A fragment from such interviews, applied to a hypothetical</p>
<p>Brahmin adult should make the point clear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;1. Is the widow&rsquo;s behavior wrong? (Yes, Widows should not eat fish ¼)</p>
<p>How serious is the violation? (A very serious violation¼)</p>
<p>Is it a sin? (Yes. It&rsquo;s a &ldquo;great&rdquo; sin.) ¼ &quot; (p.168)</p>
<p>Let us consider a similar fragment from a hypothetical American adult.</p>
<p>&ldquo;1. Is the widow&rsquo;s behavior wrong? (No. She can eat fish if she wants to.)</p>
<p>How serious is the violation? (It&rsquo;s not a violation.)</p>
<p>Is it a sin? (No.)&rdquo; ¼ (ibid.)</p>
<p>1.5. If Shweder is <em>right</em> in identifying our <em>paap</em> either as &lsquo;sin&rsquo; or as &lsquo;immoral&rsquo;, one conclusion is inescapable: we Indians must be absolute cretins really. I mean, we seem to think that what the widow eats, what she wears, etc. are <em>ethically</em> more important than whether a poor man gets treated in a hospital or not. <em>However did our culture manage to survive for a couple of thousand years, when it is governed by such idiotic &rsquo;norms&rsquo;?</em></p>
<p>As though to rub salt in the wound, Shweder assures us that the situation is really not all that pathetic. In fact, he says, one could actually provide &lsquo;reasoned defense of family life and social practice&rsquo;, albeit in the form of an &ldquo;ideal&rdquo; argument structure. How does it look? &ldquo;The body is a temple with a spirit dwelling in it. Therefore the sanctity of the temple must be preserved. Therefore impure things must be kept out of and away from the body (p. 198).&rdquo; It is important to note that this &lsquo;reasoned&rsquo; defense occurs only to Shweder&rsquo;s mind: no child &lsquo;argues&rsquo; the way Shweder does.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>During the colonial period, we were described as <em>immoral</em> people. This is one end of the spectrum. At the other end, we have &rsquo;liberals&rsquo; like Shweder, who make us into a bunch of moral <em>cretins</em>. So, it appears, we have two choices: either we are immoral or we are moral idiots. Not much of a choice, is it?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why does this situation come about? This is not a <em>translation</em> problem (&lsquo;how should we translate <em>paap</em> into English?&rsquo;), but an empirical and theoretical problem: <em>what is it about the western ethical tradition that makes the Indian culture either immoral or morally senile?</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To answer this question, we <em>need</em> to develop a theory of ethics, which does two things <em>simultaneously</em>: (a) show how and why there is an <em>ethical domain</em> in the Indian culture and in what ways it differs from the Western ethical domain; and (b) what are the <em>constraints</em> on the western ethical tradition that it is <em>forced</em> to describe us the way it has.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This means such a theory of ethics will be a direct <em>competitor</em> to the Western thinking on ethics. That is to say, our &lsquo;westology&rsquo; will not remain a mere &lsquo;westology&rsquo; but will be forced to provide an <em>alternative</em> and <em>competing</em> way of looking at the ethical phenomenon itself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is what I discovered when I started working my project out. My theory of religion <em>is</em> an alternate to the current theories of religion: it shows not merely that the western intellectuals are <em>wrong</em> but also explains why they had to be <em>necessarily</em> wrong. Idem for my current work in ethics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is here that one experiences the humiliation of <em>racism</em>. It is almost inconceivable to the western intellectuals, at least this has been my experience, that an Indian could stand up and <em>prove</em> that three hundred years of western scholarship has been wrong. You are never forgiven for this insult; I mean, it is simply not on. If you reproduce the &lsquo;post-colonial&rsquo; verbiage, you will be rewarded with a professorship in Columbia, Chicago or California. But, beware, if you say, let us compete on <em>equal terms</em> scientifically; may the best theory carry the day; and that happens to be your theory!</p>
