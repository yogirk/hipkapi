        <p>With some justifiable distortion, one can claim that the Indian Adhyatmic traditions revolve partially around some &lsquo;philosophical&rsquo; questions: what is real and what is existence? Is there a distinction between the two and, if yes, how to draw that line? This is a distortion because the debate never took this form; it is justifiable nonetheless to present it this way because it gives us a handle to tackle them today. However, we need to note that this is our way of posing the question, not theirs. Therefore, whether or not &ldquo;believing&rdquo; in Rama or Krishna entails the existence of such entities requires clarity about notions like &rsquo;existence&rsquo; and &lsquo;belief&rsquo; in the Indian traditions. I do not have this clarity and, only recently, I was told that the Indian intellectual traditions (in Sanskrit) do not have a word for &lsquo;belief&rsquo;. (It is as yet unclear to me what this implies: does it have the same force as the statement that Indians did not have a word for &lsquo;gravitation&rsquo; either or whether the notion of knowledge that we have is different from what we think knowledge is today.) Consequently, I cannot say much about this discussion today.</p>
<p>Only recently, I have begun to come to grips with what meditation is (as I can endorse it within the framework of my knowledge about the 21st century world). This understanding of what &lsquo;adhyatma&rsquo; is has also helped me come to grips with the notions of &lsquo;real&rsquo; and &rsquo;existence&rsquo;, the way, I believe, Indian traditions have used them so far. One of these days (hopefully, soon) I intend to write a note on the issue of adhyatma. Until such stage, I am afraid you have to be content with this (rather cryptic) remark.</p>
<p>You ask: &ldquo;What does it mean to be a bhakta of Rama or Krishna? Does it mean we should believe certain things about them? Or does it mean we display certain attitudes towards these characters and stories?&rdquo; The answer is: choose whichever option helps you to become their bhakta, if that is what you want. To bhakti, both the questions and their answers are utterly immaterial. Ramayana is a way of achieving enlightenment and neither the success nor its efficacy depends on either the questions or their answers. Answering these questions will not help you become their bhakta; neither does ignorance about these prevent you from becoming one.</p>
<p>In the simplest possible terms, and to repeat once again: Ramayana is a way (to some, the only way) to reach enlightenment. When I write the note I intend, you will see that this is the basic truth about Ramayana. (When you understand this, as our traditions never tire of saying, you will have understood everything.)</p>
