hipkapi</span></div></header><div class=post-excerpt><p>About the state, state action and the issue of public interest. There are multiple problems here, which I am only slowly beginning to recognize. I will share two such problems with you without, however, being able to concretely spell out the alternatives. (a) Consider the belief that the state &lsquo;ought&rsquo; to act in the public interest. This belief makes sense if we assume that it is possible to speak in terms of &lsquo;public interest&rsquo; in some non-trivial fashion. Both Kenneth Arrow and Amrtya Sen have proved theorems that show that any such use incoherent: Arrow argued that we cannot speak of &lsquo;public will&rsquo; in any coherent way; Sen argued that we cannot aggregateprivate preferences into a consistent and coherent set of &lsquo;public preferences&rsquo;. Our notion of &lsquo;public interest&rsquo; includes these two notions and, as a consequence, does not allow of a coherent conceptualization. Even banning smoking in public places (whatever the notion of a &lsquo;public space&rsquo; be) is not very coherent, if argued in terms of &lsquo;public interest&rsquo;. In this sense, justifying complex actions, which carry unintended consequences, in the name of public interest is not an interesting exercise. (b) Despite this, the idea of the state and its relation to public interest preoccupies people because of something else: that is the belief that every institution in society has an &lsquo;interest&rsquo; and the state has a &lsquo;public interest&rsquo;. That is, there is an underlying assumption of &lsquo;intelligibility&rsquo; to claims about &ldquo;institutional interests&rsquo;: each institution has an interest the way each individual has either a &lsquo;desire&rsquo; or &lsquo;interest&rsquo;. The more I read history, the less intelligible it has become to me. I believe that this claim is a &lsquo;secular translation&rsquo; of the idea that <em>the Christian Church has some set of interests</em> and political thinking, since the Middle Ages in Europe, has so constantly hammered on this theme that it has become a trivial fact that we take for granted. It is totally unclear to me how we identify the &lsquo;interests&rsquo; of a social institution, the State included, and how we find out whether we are wrong or right in attributing such an &lsquo;interest&rsquo; to a social institution. In other words, we have no clue how we solve our disagreement in this area of legal and political philosophy: the more radical the disagreement, the less clear how we should solve the issue: suppose I deny that the State has any set of interests that it can call its own, how do we solve this disagreement? On the basis of some or another definition about what &lsquo;interest&rsquo; is or what &lsquo;State&rsquo; is?</p></div><footer class=card-footer><div class=compact-post-categories><a href=/hipkapi/categories/balagangadhara/ class=compact-post-category>Balagangadhara</a>

hipkapi</span></div></header><div class=post-excerpt><p>Larry Laudan&rsquo;s <a href=https://www.academia.edu/805698/Is_Reasonable_Doubt_Reasonable>&ldquo;How Reasonable is &lsquo;Proof Beyond a Reasonable Doubt&rsquo;?&rdquo;</a> (published in the journal Legal Theory), shows how the principle of proof beyond a reasonable doubt is utterly unreasonable when one analyzes it in terms of  epistemological standards. Laudan&rsquo;s argument is convincing. The problem is it makes all these judges and lawyers look like <em>fools</em>. Balu was not satisfied by Laudan&rsquo;s pragmatic justification of proof  beyond a reasonable doubt (of 10 accused, the principle will lead to 9 being legitimately convicted and 1 innocent fellow going to the gallows). Interestingly, the advocacy of this legal principle often invokes a notion of &lsquo;moral certainty&rsquo;. It is as though when a group of 12 (?) jury members and a judge unanimously come to the decision that there is proof beyond a reasonable doubt, then the individual at the other end must be guilty of whatever he or she is accused of. Now, this attitude, Balu suggests, reflects the notion of conscience in the Christian religion. According to the theology of conscience, God has inscribed His Law for humanity in all human creatures. A few definitions can show what conscience means to Christians: &ldquo;The conscience of man…Is a man&rsquo;s judgement of himselfe, according to the judgement of God of him.&rdquo; Or: &ldquo;Conscience is that Power, or Faculty of the Mind, which judges of our Actions according to a right Rule, whether they be agreeable to it or not.&rdquo; This rule is God&rsquo;s Will. Conscience is called &ldquo;that universal Monarch, whose Ubiquitary Throne is establish&rsquo;d in every mortal Breast.&rdquo; A Quaker writes that conscience is &ldquo;an Ability in the Understanding of man, by a reflective act to judge of himself in all he does, as to his acceptance or rejection with God&rdquo; and he adds that &ldquo;this is the inward Rule he hath to walk by.&rdquo; Before the fall, Adam had been perfectly good and even after the fall, humankind retained the knowledge of the perfectly good in contrast with evil. This perfect knowledge allowed man to distinguish &ldquo;between Good and Evil,&rdquo; and worked as &ldquo;a constant witness to God in his soul, and by secret reference to what he was at firrst, tells him what he still ought to be.&rdquo; The left-over of God&rsquo;s Will in us after the Fall is what we still call conscience. In other words, conscience tells us how we ought to act according to God&rsquo;s Will and judges every act of ours in relation to this norm. Given the belief that each individual conscience still reflects the Will of God to some extent (unless it is completely corrupted, but this the selection of jury members is supposed to prevent), the origin of the notions of moral certainty and proof beyond a reasonable doubt becomes clear. When so many good Christians agree on the guilt of the accused, it must be God&rsquo;s Will speaking through their consciences. It is sickening to see how law&rsquo;s reproduction of secularized Christian attitudes towards morality leads to the upholding of a silly principle in the American courts (and to the conviction of innocents).</p></div><footer class=card-footer><div class=compact-post-categories><a href=/hipkapi/categories/balagangadhara/ class=compact-post-category>Balagangadhara</a>

hipkapi</span></div></header><div class=post-excerpt><p>One of these so-called secular accounts that are in fact Christian is the belief that all cultures have a religion. It is simply a secularization of the Christian belief that the biblical God gave religion to humankind, which was transformed into the assumption that religion is a cultural universal during the Enlightenment. This pre-theoretical assumption precedes all empirical research and theory-formation on religion and culture. From the early missionaries to the contemporary anthropologists, no one has ever even doubted that the phenomenon of religion is universal to all cultures. All psychological and sociological and even biological and neurological explanations of religion take this pre-theoretical Christian theological assumption as a starting point. Now, this is hardly scientific, isn&rsquo;t it? In <a href=http://sites.google.com/site/colonialconsciousness/theheatheninhisblindness>his book &lsquo;The Heathen in His Blindness: Asia, the West and the dynamic of religion&rsquo;</a>, Balagangadhara shows that the belief that all cultures have religion has more to do with the structure of the Christian religion than with the nature of human cultures. Furthermore, he develops a theory of religion which reveals that Christianity, Islam, and Judaism are at present the only instances of the phenomenon of religion. On top of that, he shows why those belonging to these religions and to the cultures they have created, are deeply inclined to believe that all human cultures must have a religion or at least a world view. The latter belief in the universality of religion is not a scientific hypothesis at all, but a religious doctrine. He also shows that the pagan traditions have a structure that is completely different from that of these three religions. In other words, the semitic religions and the pagan traditions are not variants of the same supposedly universal phenomenon of religion, rather they are <strong>different phenomena</strong> .</p></div><footer class=card-footer><div class=compact-post-categories><a href=/hipkapi/categories/jakob/ class=compact-post-category>Jakob</a>

hipkapi</span></div></header><div class=post-excerpt><p>Can history-centrism <em>cause</em> some religion or the other to be belief-based? The notion of &ldquo;history-centrism&rdquo; is too vague to allow a serious answer. In so far as this refers to a &ldquo;Grand narrative&rdquo;, and this narrative is either an oral or a written account, it is a <em>candidate</em> for the status of &lsquo;belief&rsquo;. Consequently, your question takes the following form: <em>Does &ldquo;believing in&rdquo; the truth of some or another historical event cause a religion to base itself on &ldquo;beliefs&rdquo;?</em> (The contrast term to &ldquo;belief&rdquo; will have to be attitude or action or event.) As Christians do, you might want to distinguish between &ldquo;believing in&rdquo; (a propositional attitude) and a set of &ldquo;beliefs&rdquo; (which are a set of propositions). In that case, the Christian stance is superior to your formulation: they say that <em>believing in</em> God is primary with respect to the belief that &ldquo;God exists&rdquo; or that &ldquo;Christ has come&rdquo; or any such thing.</p></div><footer class=card-footer><div class=compact-post-categories><a href=/hipkapi/categories/balagangadhara/ class=compact-post-category>Balagangadhara</a>

With Galileo Galilei, two things happened. (a) He argued that the earth moves round the sun. (b) On the basis of this theory, he claimed that we are compelled to observe the movement of the sun around the earth. Because of this, a distinction became necessary: the movement of the sun is merely a phenomenon, whereas the movement of the earth is the real truth. What we previously thought as reality became downgraded to a mere appearance and something we did not know until then became the reality underlying this appearance.</li></ol><p>Of course, appearance is as much a part of Reality as the essence (or underlying reality, or whatever terminology you feel like using) is. So, we have three notions: appearance, the underlying reality, and the Reality that unites appearance with the underlying reality. (One might as well call them reality1, reality2 and reality3.

When I said that I refuse to call the clerk &lsquo;corrupt&rsquo; or that the issue I raise is anterior, I am talking about this phenomenon. One uses the word &lsquo;cheating&rsquo; (something like the Hindi &lsquo;Dhoka&rsquo; probably).

hipkapi</span></div></header><div class=post-excerpt><p>Does the notion of &ldquo;relative ethics&rdquo; make sense within the context of the western ethics? There are some attempts to develop &ldquo;ethical relativism&rdquo;, even though it is not clear what is relativistic about them. One would be a kind of factual claim: different people, different groups, different cultures have different principles which they consider as &ldquo;morally good&rdquo;. This does not make for ethical relativism. The issue still remains: are these principles also ethically good? That is to say, one undertakes a &rsquo;normative&rsquo; enquiry in order to find out whether all these principles are also morally acceptable. The second would be to come up with a moral norm that is &lsquo;relative&rsquo; to some person or group. Any examination would very quickly lead to the conclusion that, in so far as it is a norm, it is universalizable even if the <em>domain of objects</em> appears restricted. (That is because all &lsquo;universal&rsquo; laws specify the domain of objects, whether implicitly or explicitly, where they are applicable. The &lsquo;relativistic&rsquo; norms appear relativistic because they specify the domain explicitly.) In other words, no one has been able to come up with any coherent explication of what &lsquo;relativistic ethics&rsquo; means. (According to me, it is impossible to do so when we speak of normative ethics.)</p></div><footer class=card-footer><div class=compact-post-categories><a href=/hipkapi/categories/balagangadhara/ class=compact-post-category>Balagangadhara</a>
