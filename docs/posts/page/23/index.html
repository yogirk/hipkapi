      <p>Some have expressed the &lsquo;opinion&rsquo; that we should all be properly grateful that people express a point of view, even if they do not enter into a debate with the readers, and that the reader should either take this or leave it. Such opinions are based on either a shallow or wrong understanding of what the &lsquo;freedom&rsquo; to express one&rsquo;s opinion is all about. The legal system does not allow one to &lsquo;simply&rsquo; express one&rsquo;s point of view and &rsquo;leave it at that&rsquo;: the existence of defamation suits is ample testimony to this. In countries in Europe, there are legal guidelines about marketing and advertisement: one cannot simply advertise one&rsquo;s product &lsquo;in any which way&rsquo;. In cases which have engaged people&rsquo;s passions, those who write columns are also bound by ethical obligations to <em>respond</em>. Jeffrey Kripal and Patrick Hogan are teachers who have the moral and social task of <em>forming</em> and <em>educating</em> young minds. They cannot simply express a point of view and &rsquo;leave it at that&rsquo;. Their teaching must be based on rational grounds. When challenged <em>precisely</em> on these grounds by a layer in society, they have the <em>ethical obligation</em> to respond. They also claim to be intellectuals and this entails that they act as such: defend their &lsquo;points of view&rsquo; by providing reasonable arguments. When the latter is challenged, the demands of rationality oblige them to respond. For whatever it is worth, they appeal to their membership in the academia as researches and scientists too. This membership <em>obliges</em> them to respond to criticisms: without criticism, there is no possibility of growth of knowledge. So on and so forth. May I therefore kindly request the advocates of free speech to hold their peace, and that they catch up with their reading of Law and Ethics before they preach sermons to the rest of us?</p>

<p>Earlier, I suggested that the psychoanalytical explanations (like the transformation of Linga into a penis as a fertility symbol etc.) not only trivialize and distort but also deny access to our own experience. In this post, I want to highlight <em>one</em> of the consequences of transforming our experiences in this fashion. In at least two different ways, <em>these explanations hinder the emergence of alternative or different explanations of our experiences</em>. This is relevant to both of us. That is why, when confronted with such explanations, we do not know <em>what to say</em>. These explanations rob us not only of our experience; while doing so, they shut us up as well. As far as you are concerned, while rendering you deaf to the silence from our end, it further <em>blinds</em> you. If this is the case, one might as well ask oneself what you describe. Are you describing what you &lsquo;see&rsquo; in the mystical Ramakrishna? You could not: after all, what can you see, when you are blind? Nor it could be that you describe what you hear: you have become deaf to us. What, then, are you describing when you describe <em>your experience</em>? This issue is what this post will be about.</p>

      <p>As I see it, the issue is not whether Arun Shourie is an intellectual (or whether Prakash Karat and EMS Namboodaripad represent intellectuals). The point I was trying to make is the one between a social movement and intellectuals.  Any movement that captures the imagination of a people (or even of a cross-section of a people) has to have some or another kind of narrative. Normally, the crafting of such a narrative involves the labor of intellectuals. Congress had one such when it was a mass movement; however, it lost that narrative in the course of the last decades. In the process of losing its own narrative, it has also accommodated multiple voices and narrators: the so-called &lsquo;radical&rsquo; intellectuals in India have prospered under the congress rule. The Communist Parties have their intellectuals, both native and foreign and from yesterday and today. The BJP did find resonance in a cross-section of the people in India and yet it does not appear to possess a distinct narrative of its own. The fact that BJP gets characterized in different ways (&lsquo;Hindu Fundamentalist&rsquo;, &lsquo;Fascist&rsquo;, &lsquo;Nationalist&rsquo;, etc) by different people indicates that these characterizations have more to do with the theory that one accepts about these phenomena (&lsquo;religious fundamentalism&rsquo;, &lsquo;fascism&rsquo;, &rsquo;nationalism&rsquo;, etc) than they have to do with the &lsquo;story&rsquo; that BJP tells. Furthermore, the BJP is also hostile to intellectuals: in fact, it is very typical to hear them identify &lsquo;intellectuals&rsquo; with &lsquo;secular thinkers&rsquo;. It is almost as though they think that this social layer, which the intellectuals are, is an &lsquo;alien growth&rsquo; in the Indian culture, something that the British created. While it is undoubtedly true that the kind of academic intellectuals we have today are outgrowths of colonial and post-colonial developments, this situation does not quite explain the hostility of the BJP. Hostility towards knowledge is not &rsquo;native&rsquo; to the Indian culture. At the same time, BJP is not hostile to something that is really &lsquo;alien&rsquo; to Indian culture: Nationalism. Instead, the &lsquo;ideologues&rsquo; of the BJP try to spin a deeply &rsquo;nationalist&rsquo; story.</p>

      <p>The theories (and discussions) about secularism constitute a test case for the claims advanced in &lsquo;The Heathen in his blindness: Asia, the West and the dynamic of religion&rsquo; about the universalizing drive of religion. I have suggested that religion spreads by secularizing itself, and that the distinction between the secular and the religious is drawn by and within a religion. If this is the case, then it must be possible to show that the current theories of secularism are secularizations of a particular set of theological claims. (Theology draws these distinctions and defends them.)</p>

      <p>Recently, the European Parliament hosted a meeting on &ldquo;caste discrimination in South Asia&rdquo;. At the meeting, participants stated that &ldquo;India is being ruled by castes not by laws&rdquo; and that they demanded justice, because there &ldquo;is one incredible India and one untouchable India.&rdquo; The EU was urged to come out with a policy statement on the subject. One MEP, referring to the caste system, said that &ldquo;this barbarism has to end.&rdquo; This is not the first time. However, before the EU decides to publish policy statements on caste discrimination in India, we would do well to reflect on some simple facts.</p>
