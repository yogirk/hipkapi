<p>In so far as the suggestion is that the English word &lsquo;prostitute&rsquo; does not capture the connotations of the earlier uses of &lsquo;Veshya&rsquo;, as I said, I agree with all of you. In this sense, if you further suggest that &lsquo;Apsara&rsquo; should not be considered as a synonym for &lsquo;prostitute&rsquo;, I would also agree. I do not suggest that &lsquo;apsara&rsquo; and &lsquo;prostitute&rsquo; are synonyms: for two words to be synonymous in this context, we need that both words refer to one and the same set of objects. This cannot be the case here because &lsquo;apsara&rsquo; picks out only non-human entities, whereas &lsquo;prostitute&rsquo; can also refer to human beings. I would also be grateful if anyone has a better suggestion for translating &lsquo;Veshya&rsquo;. As I said in an earlier post,&lsquo;courtesan&rsquo; is an alternative. However, a &lsquo;courtesan&rsquo; is also a prostitute, whatever else she is. On this, linguistic part, there are no disagreements.</p>

<li>You suggest that calling Apsaras as &ldquo;prostitutes in the court of Indra&rdquo; is an extreme statement. Of course, you would be right if you mean that the English word does not carry all the connotations of &lsquo;Veshya&rsquo; or even that our current usage of the word &lsquo;Veshya&rsquo; is not as rich as the earlier uses of the same word were. You are right too when you point out that the word &lsquo;Kama&rsquo;, as a pursushartha, embraces a bigger set than sexual pleasure or romantic love. Perhaps, one might prefer the word &lsquo;courtesan&rsquo; to &lsquo;prostitute&rsquo; but that distorts the Indian &lsquo;Veshya&rsquo; too: a courtesan was either a mistress of the wealthy or a prostitute who entertained only the rich. However, I am not sure whether my claim is really that extreme (with the proviso that we keep in mind the current-day changes in the meanings of the words in both English and Indian languages). Let me explain why.</li>
</ol>
<p>When we read, say, Kamasutra, we discover that prostitutes had to be cultured and learned human beings; they were supposed to be proficient in multiple arts including music, poetry, dance, handicrafts and so on. &lsquo;Treating the prostitutes humanely&rsquo; includes teaching these skills to them: after all, many of the arts they practiced to entertain men requires teaching and learning. This suggests that a teacher could take prostitutes as his/her students and that the society did not disapprove. Instead, it countenanced such teaching. However, this is not all there is to the story. Consider the fact that a prostitute is also called &rsquo;nitya sumangali&rsquo;: one who can never become a widow. As you know, the word &lsquo;sumangali&rsquo; is not usedlightly in India and it carries a very positive connotation as is also indexed by the use of &lsquo;su&rsquo;. (Of course, one uses this term also sarcastically in colloquial language but such use does not take away the positive connotation.) Even though the prostitute never marries, our traditions did not withhold the appellation &lsquo;sumangali&rsquo; from her. Consider too, in this context, the &lsquo;good qualities&rsquo; of a wife: &lsquo;Karyeshu dasi, Karaneshu mantri&hellip;.&rsquo; As this verse (I have forgotten both its source and how it ends) continues, it appears that a wife should also be &lsquo;shayaneshu veshya&rsquo; (a prostitute in bed). Quite independent of the conjectures we can make about its anti-feministic character or whatever, think about what this verse is suggesting: the wife should behave like a prostitute in the bedroom. What does that mean? Whether or not it also means that she should entertain her husband through music, recitation of poetry, dance and such like, one thing is clear: she must be well-versed in sexual matters. Step back for a moment and ask yourself how any girl could be well-versed (better than her husband, in fact) in sexual matters. There are only two possibilities: either the girl had a lot of experience in sex before marriage (there goes the idea of virginity of one&rsquo;s wife) or she was trained and educated in the art of sex in her family. Irrespective of which of the possibilities is true, this verse indicates at least two things: being a prostitute did not make one immoral anymore than visiting a prostitute made one immoral. The prostitute had qualities which a &lsquo;good wife&rsquo; should emulate. Note that these qualities are not those that prostitutes also have; the wife is supposed to have those qualities that make a woman into a prostitute (&lsquo;shayaneshu veshya&rsquo;).  Furthermore, in so far as women were taught the &lsquo;art of loving&rsquo; (kama-sutra) in their families, surely, it tells us that the reaction of the middle class in India today is anything but Indian: it is an inherited prudishness drawn from the Victorian morality. It is in this sense that I suggested that the Indians are not prudes in matters of sexuality. In this sense too, in this Indian sense, Apsaras, I claim, are &ldquo;prostitutes in the court of Indra&rdquo;.</p>

      <p>1.1. The Indian traditions did not have the same attitude as Christianity towards prostitution or adultery. And the Indians of yesteryears were not defenders of the Victorian (and Christian) morality. Of course, I approvingly said that the &ldquo;Indians are not prudes&rdquo; but this approval has to do with the thrust of Indian thought, as I have understood it: the impossibility of prohibiting or making obligatory some or another action universally. (This is my formulation, of course.) I do believe that the Indians recognized the impossibility of abolishing prostitution (which is why it is called &ldquo;the oldest profession&rdquo;). Instead, therefore, of banning and condemning prostitution (and subsequently turn a blind eye towards its existence), Indian thinkers suggested that we treat the prostitutes humanely. I have never been to a prostitute nor will I ever go to one; but that does not mean that I want to ignore their existence and treat them as non-humans. Nor am I willing to call all those who visit prostitutes as criminals and perverts. I know of too many lonely men and women who have found human warmth and personal comfort in the arms and companionship of prostitutes to consider them as perverts.</p>

      <p>Let me invite you to do a thought-experiment along with me.</p>
<p>Imagine that all human beings seek happiness. Imagine too that they can all achieve this state of being. Because, as I said in one of my posts, there are no qualifications (or requirements) to reach this end-state; any and all ways are conducive to reach this end-state: thinking, meditation, music, dance, and, yes, even going to temples and reciting &lsquo;sahasranaamams.&rsquo; At any and every stage and moment, people can achieve happiness.</p>

      <p>I think there is a simpler answer to why we do not eat beef: &ldquo;we do not see it as food.&rdquo; In the same way people in the Nazi concentration camps and the Ethiopians during the famine did not see fellow human beings as edible items, we do not see cows as food. (Contrast this with the story of a plane crash in the Andes Mountain some three decades ago, where the dead were cannibalized by the living in order to survive.) Culture, upbringing and even beliefs (in the case of some people) could help explain this situation. The central point, however, is that we do not see it as food.</p>
