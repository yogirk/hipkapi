If you use &lsquo;games&rsquo; in a very, very general sense (viz. there are players, strategies, end-results, and such like), then it might. There is a flourishing branch of mathematics called &lsquo;Game theory&rsquo; that has been used to study many things in nature and society: from the evolution of rules and norms to seeing evolution itself in Game-theoretic terms. I need to warn you that its notion of games is a technical one and involves two or more &lsquo;players&rsquo;, who follow certain strategies for &lsquo;winning&rsquo; to which a certain pay-off is coupled. While it has uncovered certain interesting dilemmas in societies, I do not find it as fruitful as its practitioners claim.</p></div><footer class=card-footer><div class=compact-post-categories><a href=/hipkapi/categories/balagangadhara/ class=compact-post-category>Balagangadhara</a>

hipkapi</span></div></header><div class=post-excerpt><p>About the possibility that I was already &lsquo;westernized&rsquo; by the time I became a teenager. Even this question is wrongly posed. I am not claiming that there is some &lsquo;authentic&rsquo; Indian culture, which lives somewhere or lived some when in India. Such a culture, even if it exists or existed, does not concern me. I am interested in the Indian culture as it <em>exists</em> today: including the aftermath of the Islamic and the British colonization. I am child of <em>this</em> culture, and this is the one I am trying to understand. The Indian &lsquo;Diaspora&rsquo; in the US is <em>as much</em> Indian as some peasant living somewhere in a far-off village in India; they both belong to the Indian culture. Neither this peasant nor the Indians in the US is &lsquo;more Indian&rsquo; than the other. My problem is not: who is the &lsquo;authentic&rsquo; Indian or what is the &lsquo;authentic&rsquo; Indian culture? My question is about the 21st century India, and its present culture, which has absorbed many things, adapted many things from other cultures in many different ways. It is this set of Indian traditions that interests me. Was I &lsquo;westernized&rsquo; by the time I was a teenager? Who knows, or even who cares? What would it mean to say that I was &lsquo;authentically&rsquo; Indian or that I was &lsquo;quasi-westernized&rsquo;? Surely, the issue is not about some kind of &lsquo;purity&rsquo; here. What else is it? Consequently, when I speak of my past, I speak of the past of those who were brought up like me. If we were all partly &lsquo;westernized&rsquo;, then the culture I am talking about is this &lsquo;partly westernized&rsquo; Indian culture. An age long gone by, if it ever existed, does not give me sleepless nights; what does is what is happening now. Thus, when I say I want to understand Indian culture, I am not harking back to some &lsquo;golden age&rsquo;, my friend, but India as I know it today. To understand this India, I need to understand how her traditions are <em>lived</em> today, not what they perhaps meant one thousand years ago.</p></div><footer class=card-footer><div class=compact-post-categories><a href=/hipkapi/categories/balagangadhara/ class=compact-post-category>Balagangadhara</a>

hipkapi</span></div></header><div class=post-excerpt><p>I have had difficulties in understanding the use and meaning of some words, especially &rsquo;essentialism&rsquo; and its cognates. Here are some uses of &ldquo;essentialism&rdquo; I am familiar with.</p><ol><li>One uses &rsquo;essences&rsquo; to designate some basic or fundamental or determining properties of an object, as in: &ldquo;Water is essentially H2O&rdquo;. Here the claim is that some liquid is water if and only if it has the chemical structure of containing two molecules of Hydrogen and one molecule of Oxygen for every single molecule of the liquid in question.</li><li>One uses &rsquo;essences&rsquo; in order to understand counterfactual sentences involving proper nouns, as in: &ldquo;If I were George Bush, I would not have gone to war with Iraq&rdquo;. This sentence is a counterfactual because it begins by assuming a non-fact (I am Balu and not George Bush); picks out a state of affairs where this is true (a possible world where &lsquo;Balu&rsquo; IS &lsquo;George Bush&rsquo;) and makes a (true or false) statement about this (I might or might not have gone to war with Iraq). Many historical claims (and many scientific laws) have the form of counterfactual statements. Here &rsquo;essence&rsquo; is predicated to Balu (something like &ldquo;baluhood&rdquo;) so that Balu remains Balu even if he were to become &lsquo;George Bush&rsquo; in some possible world.</li><li>One uses &rsquo;essences&rsquo; to solve the problem of providing references to proper names, as in &ldquo;Socrates was not a teacher of Plato&rdquo;. In many cases, we identify Socrates as that person who has the property of &lsquo;being a teacher of Plato&rsquo;. If it transpires that such is not the case, we will still not be in doubt about the identity of Socrates because, much like the previous case, it speaks about some &rsquo;essential property&rsquo; of Socrates by virtue of which he remains the same person even when he does not have some or another accidental or contingent property.</li><li>One uses &rsquo;essences&rsquo; while solving the puzzle of identity, as in &ldquo;This is me, a photograph taken when I was three years old&rdquo;. Here, &lsquo;me, when I was three years old&rsquo;, &lsquo;me in America during the 1990 AAR conference&rsquo; etc. become spatio-temporal slices of an &lsquo;I&rsquo;. The &lsquo;I&rsquo; has indefinitely many spatio-temporal slices and these are all slices of one and the same &lsquo;I&rsquo;. The idea is that one does not become someone else other than who one is because of the spatio-temporal career of &lsquo;oneself&rsquo;.</li></ol><p>Even though there are many discussions about each of these uses, there is nothing wrong or illegitimate about using the word &rsquo;essence&rsquo; or indeed to &ldquo;talk in an essentializing way&rdquo;. Quite obviously, the &lsquo;subaltern&rsquo; historiographers could not mean &rsquo;essentialism&rsquo; in any of the above senses, because they suggest that essentialism is something to avoid. I know of one such use of the word in Said&rsquo;s &ldquo;Orientalism&rdquo;, where he suggests that to correlate climatic conditions with the psychology or culture of a people (something that often happened in the eighteenth nineteenth centuries) is to commit the sin of essentialism. Clearly, this is not the kind of essentialism that is at issue here.</p></div><footer class=card-footer><div class=compact-post-categories><a href=/hipkapi/categories/edward-said/ class=compact-post-category>Edward Said</a>

hipkapi</span></div></header><div class=post-excerpt><p>It is true that the modern Jewish thought, which is more influenced by the Rabbinic than by apocalyptic or Qumranic literature, places less emphasis on the Devil. Rabbinic Judaism was less interested in building a demonology than others. It is one thing to say this, but quite another to say that the Judaic tradition knows of the Devil only in terms of the psychological &lsquo;inclinations&rsquo; in man. (It is equivalent to suggesting that there is no demonology in Judaic thought, a preposterous suggestion on any count.) Belial, Mastema, Azazel, Satanail, Sammael, Semyzza, or Satan do not name either psychological or spiritual &lsquo;inclinations&rsquo;, surely. (Think further of what Behemoth, Leviathan, etc. are). The Satan in the Book of Job is already an emissary of God (though not yet the personification of evil), and not a mere &lsquo;inclination&rsquo;. The Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs name Belial or Satan as Chief of evil angels commanding the spirits of wrath, hatred, etc. and as lord of war, fornication, bloodshed, destruction, etc. He tempts and seduces humankind to error.</p></div><footer class=card-footer><div class=compact-post-categories><a href=/hipkapi/categories/balagangadhara/ class=compact-post-category>Balagangadhara</a>

hipkapi</span></div></header><div class=post-excerpt><p>About the multiple meanings for the Puja of Ganesha. Of course, there is no one &lsquo;meaning&rsquo; to this act either now, or before, or in the future, as far as Indians (and the Westerners) are concerned. But that is not being disputed. The dispute arises when some meaning is alleged to portray the &rsquo;experience&rsquo; of a culture, when all it does is distort and deny the experience it is said to portray. However, there is an interesting question here, which is best illustrated using a contrast. In the Catholic Mass, there are <em>limits</em> on what it could be said to mean to a believer. These limits are set by the Catholic theology and belief. (For instance, to a believer, it <em>cannot</em> mean celebrating the Devil.) The puja of Ganesha does not set any such limits to the person who does this puja. (But if someone comes and tells me that I cook sweets on Ganesha Chaturthi because it expresses my &lsquo;subconscious&rsquo; desire for Oral Sex, I am justified in challenging this claim as an &rsquo;explanation&rsquo; of my cooking the sweets.) Here is the question: what is puja in the Indian traditions, if it does not have a particular meaning, and there are no limits on what it means? One thing is already clear: it cannot mean &lsquo;worship&rsquo;! These are the kind of questions I would like to ask; not what &lsquo;interpretation&rsquo; one gives to some action or the other. The answer I give should be capable of being &rsquo;tested&rsquo; in the Indian culture. Then, I will have begun producing an &lsquo;objective&rsquo; theory.</p></div><footer class=card-footer><div class=compact-post-categories><a href=/hipkapi/categories/balagangadhara/ class=compact-post-category>Balagangadhara</a>

It would be eminently desirable. It will take some time though before we get there, but we will surely get there. Thanks to computers, we have a possibility of talking realistically about simulation. However, we have to still go a very long way before we are able to do so. We need to build some theories about social and cultural change and evolution; we need to develop suitable algorithms for simulating these changes; we need to develop more and different kinds of logics (non-monotonic ones) than exist today; we need to simulate some relevant aspects of human reasoning process … It is only now that we are <em>beginning</em> to simulate the evolutionary process and have developed some kinds of algorithms to do so. We need to overlay this with developments (hardly understood today) about social dynamics and cultural dynamics. And then study what could happen. So, it is definitely going to take some time. In all probability, we will first start simulating some fragments of social or cultural reality first (after all, this is what modeling means).</p></div><footer class=card-footer><div class=compact-post-categories><a href=/hipkapi/categories/balagangadhara/ class=compact-post-category>Balagangadhara</a>

hipkapi</span></div></header><div class=post-excerpt><ol><li>Let us begin in a very intuitive way and ask ourselves this question: where do we encounter &lsquo;cultural differences&rsquo;? In human contacts, of course. What kind of human contacts? <em>In inter-individual contacts</em>. That is, we see (or sense, or intuit or whatever) cultural differences in our contacts with <em>individual</em> human beings. You do not meet &rsquo;the western culture&rsquo; but individual Americans, Germans, French, etc. Neither do these individuals meet &rsquo;the Indian culture&rsquo;: they meet individual Indians (or, even better, a &lsquo;Madrasi Brahmin&rsquo;, a &lsquo;Gujerati Baniya&rsquo; - even these are general categories but I use them just to get the point across.) And yet, we appear to see cultural differences in these contacts. How to make &lsquo;sense&rsquo; of <em>this experience</em>? Let us first see what is partially involved to truly appreciate the complexity of our &lsquo;perception&rsquo;.</li></ol><p>1.1. Each individual human being is a complex combination of at least four aspects. There is his biological (or genetic) inheritance; there is his &lsquo;social&rsquo; inheritance (whether he is from the Middle Ages or from a capitalist society); there is his psychological makeup (let us say his &lsquo;personality&rsquo;); and there is his cultural upbringing (whether he is a Madhva Brahmin or a Lingayat, say). When we meet individuals, in many different ways we notice these <em>differences</em>: the biological, the psychological and, after some time perhaps, &rsquo;the social&rsquo; and &rsquo;the cultural&rsquo;. Let us bracket the biological away so that the situation becomes deliciously complex. Let us agree to use the following &lsquo;words&rsquo; (they are just words for now) in order to go ahead and raise the problem. Let us call the &lsquo;social aspects&rsquo; of a person the &lsquo;sociality&rsquo; of the person; the psychological aspects the &lsquo;personality&rsquo; of the person; and the &lsquo;cultural&rsquo; aspects the &lsquo;culturality&rsquo; of the person. Thus we meet individual human beings and see the differences between ourselves and the other human beings. What kinds of differences do we see?</p></div><footer class=card-footer><div class=compact-post-categories><a href=/hipkapi/categories/balagangadhara/ class=compact-post-category>Balagangadhara</a>

Why do I say this? There are primarily two reasons: our ignorance and the principle of &lsquo;charity&rsquo;. Let me explain.</p><p>(a) <strong>Our ignorance</strong>. We know very little about how cultures come into being, how they reproduce themselves and how they disappear. Until such a stage, where we are able to discuss each cultural practice (like rain dance, for example) individually, we should avoid making a virtue of our ignorance. One could come up with any number of explanations today to explain a cultural practice like rain dance. Without exception, they would <em>all</em> be ad hoc in nature and, as such, the opposite of what a scientific explanation is. Therefore, my criticism of such explanations is to show their ad hoc character and, where possible, identify what makes them ad hoc. The purpose? To move forward in order to develop a science of cultures and cultural differences.</p></div><footer class=card-footer><div class=compact-post-categories><a href=/hipkapi/categories/balagangadhara/ class=compact-post-category>Balagangadhara</a>

hipkapi</span></div></header><div class=post-excerpt><ol><li><p>To begin with, there is the feeling that scientific explanations, with their emphasis on rationality and objectivity, are reductive in nature. Wherein lies the <em>root</em> of this feeling? Let us say that some physical theory describes the motion of a snow flake gently floating down to earth or a rose petal lazily spinning in the air. Or that some branch of human genetics computes the probability of a particular human child being born with absolutely dark eyes or ones that are brilliantly blue. Is either of these two explanations reductive in nature? Not quite: their mathematical calculations tell us very little about the laziness of the petal or about the brilliance of blue eyes, it is true, but it is not their &lsquo;job&rsquo; to do so. If you want to relish descriptions of an autumn evening or a spring morning, you do not open Feynman&rsquo;s Lectures on Physics, do you? You go elsewhere. In other words, the theories in the natural sciences are not &lsquo;reductive&rsquo; in the sense that they do not reduce the <em>beauty</em> of a particular sunset to the motion of earth around the Sun even if they explain sunrise and sunset.</p></div><footer class=card-footer><div class=compact-post-categories><a href=/hipkapi/categories/balagangadhara/ class=compact-post-category>Balagangadhara</a>

I do not identify Wendy&rsquo;s statement as an &lsquo;ad hoc&rsquo; explanation. I say that it trivializes what I am doing by providing a distorted description of what I do. Here is what I say: &ldquo;I am doing Puja to Shiva.&rdquo; No discussion about &lsquo;Lingam&rsquo; or its many meanings. This is a <em>wrong</em> way of conducting a discussion. She cannot, therefore, argue that I am giving an &lsquo;ad hoc&rsquo; explanation because I am not giving an &rsquo;explanation&rsquo; of what I am doing but merely describing it.</p></div><footer class=card-footer><div class=compact-post-categories><a href=/hipkapi/categories/balagangadhara/ class=compact-post-category>Balagangadhara</a>
