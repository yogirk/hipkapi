hipkapi</span></div></header><div class=post-excerpt><ol><li>You suggest that calling Apsaras as &ldquo;prostitutes in the court of Indra&rdquo; is an extreme statement. Of course, you would be right if you mean that the English word does not carry all the connotations of &lsquo;Veshya&rsquo; or even that our current usage of the word &lsquo;Veshya&rsquo; is not as rich as the earlier uses of the same word were. You are right too when you point out that the word &lsquo;Kama&rsquo;, as a pursushartha, embraces a bigger set than sexual pleasure or romantic love. Perhaps, one might prefer the word &lsquo;courtesan&rsquo; to &lsquo;prostitute&rsquo; but that distorts the Indian &lsquo;Veshya&rsquo; too: a courtesan was either a mistress of the wealthy or a prostitute who entertained only the rich. However, I am not sure whether my claim is really that extreme (with the proviso that we keep in mind the current-day changes in the meanings of the words in both English and Indian languages). Let me explain why.</li></ol><p>When we read, say, Kamasutra, we discover that prostitutes had to be cultured and learned human beings; they were supposed to be proficient in multiple arts including music, poetry, dance, handicrafts and so on. &lsquo;Treating the prostitutes humanely&rsquo; includes teaching these skills to them: after all, many of the arts they practiced to entertain men requires teaching and learning. This suggests that a teacher could take prostitutes as his/her students and that the society did not disapprove. Instead, it countenanced such teaching. However, this is not all there is to the story. Consider the fact that a prostitute is also called &rsquo;nitya sumangali&rsquo;: one who can never become a widow. As you know, the word &lsquo;sumangali&rsquo; is not usedlightly in India and it carries a very positive connotation as is also indexed by the use of &lsquo;su&rsquo;. (Of course, one uses this term also sarcastically in colloquial language but such use does not take away the positive connotation.) Even though the prostitute never marries, our traditions did not withhold the appellation &lsquo;sumangali&rsquo; from her. Consider too, in this context, the &lsquo;good qualities&rsquo; of a wife: &lsquo;Karyeshu dasi, Karaneshu mantri&mldr;.&rsquo; As this verse (I have forgotten both its source and how it ends) continues, it appears that a wife should also be &lsquo;shayaneshu veshya&rsquo; (a prostitute in bed). Quite independent of the conjectures we can make about its anti-feministic character or whatever, think about what this verse is suggesting: the wife should behave like a prostitute in the bedroom. What does that mean? Whether or not it also means that she should entertain her husband through music, recitation of poetry, dance and such like, one thing is clear: she must be well-versed in sexual matters. Step back for a moment and ask yourself how any girl could be well-versed (better than her husband, in fact) in sexual matters. There are only two possibilities: either the girl had a lot of experience in sex before marriage (there goes the idea of virginity of one&rsquo;s wife) or she was trained and educated in the art of sex in her family. Irrespective of which of the possibilities is true, this verse indicates at least two things: being a prostitute did not make one immoral anymore than visiting a prostitute made one immoral. The prostitute had qualities which a &lsquo;good wife&rsquo; should emulate. Note that these qualities are not those that prostitutes also have; the wife is supposed to have those qualities that make a woman into a prostitute (&lsquo;shayaneshu veshya&rsquo;).  Furthermore, in so far as women were taught the &lsquo;art of loving&rsquo; (kama-sutra) in their families, surely, it tells us that the reaction of the middle class in India today is anything but Indian: it is an inherited prudishness drawn from the Victorian morality. It is in this sense that I suggested that the Indians are not prudes in matters of sexuality. In this sense too, in this Indian sense, Apsaras, I claim, are &ldquo;prostitutes in the court of Indra&rdquo;.</p></div><footer class=card-footer><div class=compact-post-categories><a href=/hipkapi/categories/balagangadhara/ class=compact-post-category>Balagangadhara</a>

hipkapi</span></div></header><div class=post-excerpt><p>1.1. The Indian traditions did not have the same attitude as Christianity towards prostitution or adultery. And the Indians of yesteryears were not defenders of the Victorian (and Christian) morality. Of course, I approvingly said that the &ldquo;Indians are not prudes&rdquo; but this approval has to do with the thrust of Indian thought, as I have understood it: the impossibility of prohibiting or making obligatory some or another action universally. (This is my formulation, of course.) I do believe that the Indians recognized the impossibility of abolishing prostitution (which is why it is called &ldquo;the oldest profession&rdquo;). Instead, therefore, of banning and condemning prostitution (and subsequently turn a blind eye towards its existence), Indian thinkers suggested that we treat the prostitutes humanely. I have never been to a prostitute nor will I ever go to one; but that does not mean that I want to ignore their existence and treat them as non-humans. Nor am I willing to call all those who visit prostitutes as criminals and perverts. I know of too many lonely men and women who have found human warmth and personal comfort in the arms and companionship of prostitutes to consider them as perverts.</p></div><footer class=card-footer><div class=compact-post-categories><a href=/hipkapi/categories/balagangadhara/ class=compact-post-category>Balagangadhara</a>

hipkapi</span></div></header><div class=post-excerpt><p>1. Here is one way of looking at what stories are. They are symbols. What are they symbols of? Well, they could symbolize acts; they could also be symbolically interpreted as justifications of such acts. Under this construal, a story requires an interpretation: one has to interpret the story as a symbol of either an act or as its symbolic justification. (The same applies to looking at stories as symbols of values. The stories, for instance, could be seen to symbolize virtues. Stories could also symbolize passions, feelings, natural forces&mldr;) Then, stories are mostly, if not always, symbols of something or another. When you look at the issue this way, it is almost akin to saying that stories are &ldquo;evidences&rdquo; of sorts: some story or another provides &ldquo;evidence&rdquo; about the presence of &ldquo;something else&rdquo;. (Let us leave aside the issue of what it means to talk of a symbol in all these contexts or what &ldquo;evidence&rdquo; means here. Both terms can be understood in a vague sense for our purposes.) In another language, we can say that all stories are signs.

Let me also add that I find a quest for happiness a normal human striving.</p><p>According to the Indian traditions, experience itself is a state of being: anubhava. In my story, so is happiness (or atmasaakshaatkaara). Need one be enlightened in order to speak about enlightenment? Should that be the case, one cannot strive for enlightenment at all and I think that enlightenment (or happiness) is a legitimate goal for human beings. If happiness is not an esoteric state of being but a legitimate goal for all human beings, there are indefinitely many roads to that state of being. The strength of the Indian traditions lies not merely in recognizing this but also in working out many such routes.</p></div><footer class=card-footer><div class=compact-post-categories><a href=/hipkapi/categories/balagangadhara/ class=compact-post-category>Balagangadhara</a>

We can let someone else do the talking for us, namely Dale B. Martin in his interesting book <em>Inventing Superstition: from the Hippocratics to the Christians</em> (Harvard University Press, 2004):</li></ol><p>&ldquo;One of the basic arguments of this book is that, contrary to many modern assumptions, the category of &ldquo;the supernatural&rdquo; did not exist in ancient culture <em>as</em> <em>a category</em>. Neither popular notions, held by the vast majority of inhabitants of the ancient world, nor philosophical notions (we could say &ldquo;scientific&rdquo; with due consideration for the possible anachronistic connotations of the term) assumed that reality was split up into two realms, one &ldquo;natural,&rdquo; containing things like &ldquo;matter&rdquo; and &ldquo;natural forces&rdquo; such as gravity or electricity, and another &ldquo;supernatural,&rdquo; to which gods and similar beings (demigods, angels, demons, ghosts) could be assigned&mldr; What is important for this post is that the category was not available, either explicitly or by assumption, for persons in the classical Greek and Roman worlds. The Greeks and Romans certainly had no <em>word</em> that was equivalent to the modern English &ldquo;supernatural.&rdquo;&mldr;I do not, however, want just to quibble about words. Classical Greeks and Latin had not term for what passes in the modern world as &ldquo;the supernatural&rdquo; precisely because the ancients did not separate out divine forces and beings from &ldquo;nature&rdquo; and relegate them to a separate ontological realm that could designated by its own label. Generally, for ancient people whatever does exist exists in &ldquo;nature.&rdquo; Almost without exception the Greek term <em>physis</em> (nature) refers to &ldquo;all that is.&rdquo; People might argue that the gods did not exist or that some particular daimon or god or superhuman being did not exist (I know of no ancient author who argued for actual atheism in the modern sense). But in that case, they said that the disputed entity simply did not exist, not that it might exist in some other realm of reality, such as the &ldquo;supernatural.&rdquo; Ancient philosophers might argue that lightning was not caused by a god, but they did not do so by pointing out that lightning occurs in the &ldquo;natural&rdquo; realm and that the gods exist in the &ldquo;supernatural&rdquo; realm and that the two realms are not supposed to interact with one another. Ancient people took the gods and all other beings we would think of as &ldquo;supernatural&rdquo; to be <em>part</em> of nature if they existed at all.&rdquo; (pp. 13-15)</p></div><footer class=card-footer><div class=compact-post-categories><a href=/hipkapi/categories/indian-traditions/ class=compact-post-category>Indian traditions</a>

Let us emphasize the active dimension of the word &lsquo;Bhava&rsquo; to translate it as &lsquo;coming into existence&rsquo;. (&lsquo;Existence&rsquo; and &lsquo;being&rsquo; are also acceptable translations of the word &lsquo;Bhava&rsquo;.) Then &lsquo;Anubhava&rsquo; would mean an apt way of coming-into-existence. The problem here is this: we can ask the question, <em>coming into existence of what?</em> Of course, we can answer it easily by using hyphenation: it is not the coming-into-existence of any &rsquo;thing&rsquo; but coming-into &rsquo;existence&rsquo;. However, this might create more confusion than it solves. So, let us make a compromise here for the sake of clarity: coming-into-existence-of-being. We can also shorten it as coming-into-being, where we understand &lsquo;being&rsquo; as &lsquo;origin&rsquo;. We come into existence, we originate. In this sense, &lsquo;Anubhava&rsquo; talks about &ldquo;an appropriate originating&rdquo;. (This is all heavy-duty philosophy stuff, this is what &lsquo;ontology&rsquo; is, the &lsquo;doctrine of being&rsquo;.) As long as we keep these ideas in mind, we can say that &lsquo;bhava&rsquo; can be translated also as &lsquo;being-there-in the world&rsquo;, or as &lsquo;being present in the world&rsquo;. Thus, &lsquo;anubhava&rsquo;, or experience, is &lsquo;being appropriately present in the world&rsquo; or &lsquo;being aptly present in the world&rsquo;.</p></div><footer class=card-footer><div class=compact-post-categories><a href=/hipkapi/categories/balagangadhara/ class=compact-post-category>Balagangadhara</a>

hipkapi</span></div></header><div class=post-excerpt><p>The biggest issue is: what is experience? All the Indian traditions have been busy with answering this question. But both posing this question and answering it are themselves experiential, as far as the Indian traditions are concerned. For instance, according to the so-called Buddhist traditions, the structures-in-experience are not given in the experience itself: the impermanence and transience of experience has to do with the realization that the description of the experience provides a sense of permanence because all descriptions of experience &lsquo;create&rsquo; structures. Here, it has to do with structures like &lsquo;self&rsquo;, specific emotions, and such like. But that does not mean that the Buddhist tradition says that our &rsquo;experience&rsquo; of a tree, or a stone or a car, etc. is illusory. That is, they do not say that the &rsquo;experience&rsquo; of the external world is an illusion.</p></div><footer class=card-footer><div class=compact-post-categories><a href=/hipkapi/categories/balagangadhara/ class=compact-post-category>Balagangadhara</a>
