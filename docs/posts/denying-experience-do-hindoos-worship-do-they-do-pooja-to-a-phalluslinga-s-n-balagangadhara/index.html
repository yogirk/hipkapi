      <div class="post-content">
        <p>Someone, let&rsquo;s say her name is Wendy Doniger, comes along and sniggers &lsquo;when you worship the lingam, you worship a phallus&rsquo;. I do not identify Wendy&rsquo;s statement as an &lsquo;ad hoc&rsquo; explanation. I say that it trivializes what I am doing by providing a distorted description of what I do. Here is what I say: &ldquo;I am doing Puja to Shiva.&rdquo; No discussion about &lsquo;Lingam&rsquo; or its many meanings. This is a <em>wrong</em> way of conducting a discussion. She cannot, therefore, argue that I am giving an &lsquo;ad hoc&rsquo; explanation because I am not giving an &rsquo;explanation&rsquo; of what I am doing but merely describing it.</p>
<p>Let us sketch some scenarios in order to see what conversational moves are there in such a discussion.</p>
<p>**(**1) She sees me doing &lsquo;something&rsquo; and asks me what I am doing.</p>
<p>(2) I say I am doing Puja to Shiva. From here on, two possible threads of discussion open up. The first thread goes like this.</p>
<p>(3) Either she asks &lsquo;why&rsquo; I do it: I say, it is our tradition, or that I am a Bhakta of Shiva, or because my mother said I should, or whatever else happens to be the case. Or she asks me why Shiva has the form he has: either I tell her the story from the Puranas, or provide her a &lsquo;sthala purana&rsquo; (i.e. a story about that particular temple) or I say, &rsquo;this is how we do it&rsquo;.</p>
<p>(4) Let us say, she pursues the story from the Puranas and asks me &lsquo;So, you are worshipping the Lingam of Shiva&rsquo;. I say, &lsquo;yes, indeed, this <em>is</em> Shiva Lingam&rsquo;.</p>
<p>(5) Being persistent, she goes further: &lsquo;do you know what &lsquo;Lingam&rsquo; means?&rsquo; and I reply &lsquo;well, yes, I do know some of its meanings as we use it in our language&rsquo;.</p>
<p>(6) Suppose she isolates one meaning, say, phallus and asks me: &lsquo;So, you say you are worshipping Shiva&rsquo;s Lingam&rsquo;. I reply, unperturbed, &lsquo;yes, but I said so already: this is Shiva&rsquo;s Lingam. That is why we call it Shivalingam and not, say, KuberaLingam&rsquo;. In this thread, where I am using Indian words, she cannot even come close to saying what she wants to.</p>
<p>Suppose at step three, we switch to speaking in English.</p>
<p>(3&rsquo;) She asks what &lsquo;puja&rsquo; is and what &rsquo;lingam&rsquo; means. Here is what I would say <em>today</em>: &ldquo;&lsquo;Puja&rsquo; is best understood as a ritual; as far as &lsquo;Lingam&rsquo; is concerned, I suggest you see it as &rsquo;the form&rsquo; in which this ritual is performed to Shiva&rdquo;. Again here, two possible threads open up: the first where she &lsquo;contests&rsquo; my translation and the other where she accepts it.</p>
<p>Let us pursue the second thread to begin with.</p>
<p>(4&rsquo;) &lsquo;Why has Shiva taken this form?&rsquo; Because I am not trying to be polemical, I tell her our stories from the Puranas and say it is one of the stories from our tradition. And I add, &rsquo;to perform puja to Shiva <em>means</em> to perform the ritual to this form&rsquo;. Because my description has the form of a definition (Shiva puja=ritual to this form) no sensible discussion about it is possible.</p>
<p>(5&rsquo;) She can come up with <em>another</em> definition, but then, I say &lsquo;yes, but that is not my definition&rsquo; and the discussion is over. On this thread, where we are discussing in English, she cannot say what she wants to either.</p>
<p>Let us now suppose she contests my translation given in step (3&rsquo;). How is she going to do it?</p>
<p>(4&rsquo;) &ldquo;But you are wrong. &lsquo;Puja&rsquo; is &lsquo;worship&rsquo; and &rsquo;lingam&rsquo; means &lsquo;penis&rsquo;. Therefore, you are &lsquo;worshipping a penis when you say that you are doing puja to the Shiva Lingam&rsquo;&rdquo;. Here is what I would say <em>today:</em> &ldquo;You see, the English word &lsquo;worship&rsquo; comes basically from Christian theology where one worships either the God or the Devil and nothing else. Under no interpretation of such a theology could one consider Shiva as &lsquo;God&rsquo;, leaving us with only one possibility that Shiva is either the Devil or his minion. Is this what you want say: that we are worshipping Devil or his minions? In that case, Wendy, we are not discussing a translation issue but a Christian theological one.&rdquo; Again, two threads open up: either she denies it or asks for further explication. Let us take up her denial first.</p>
<p>(5&rsquo;) &ldquo;No, that is not what &lsquo;worship&rsquo; means. It means &lsquo;reverence&rsquo;. I am not a Christian, I was born a Jew; I know nothing of Christian theology even though I was married to one for some time.&rdquo; I would say the following today: &ldquo;Wendy, I would be willing to accept your definition of &lsquo;worship&rsquo;. But if I do so, I must do violence to other people and cultures: the Jewish, the Christian and the Muslim. From your definition, it would follow that they are not &lsquo;worshipping&rsquo; God at all! And further, they cannot. In all these cultures, one can show &lsquo;reverence&rsquo; to the elderly, the king, knowledge, the powerful, etc. To say that they show &lsquo;reverence&rsquo; to God in the same way is to transform all of them into &lsquo;idolaters&rsquo;, which, according to their theologies, is the greatest sin! I am sorry, but your translation of &lsquo;puja&rsquo; is not a mere linguistic issue.&rdquo; Again, the discussion shifts to another level. She cannot pursue this line of enquiry either.</p>
<p>Let us say she asks for explication, the other thread in step (4&rsquo;). How can the discussion proceed?</p>
<p>(5&quot;) Here let me bend the stick in favour of Wendy. &ldquo;But every Sanskrit-English dictionary, and every Indian teacher in Sanskrit who knows English, translates &lsquo;puja&rsquo; as &lsquo;worship&rsquo;. Are you saying their knowledge of either languages is deficient and <em>you are the only one</em> who knows how to translate &lsquo;Puja&rsquo; correctly?&rdquo; Being a reasonable person, I would not get offended by her rhetorical attempts to make me appear ridiculous. I would say the following: &ldquo;You see, Wendy, we all learnt English through Indian languages and were taught that &lsquo;Puja&rsquo; means &lsquo;worship&rsquo;. We give the meaning of &lsquo;Puja&rsquo; to the English word &lsquo;worship&rsquo;. The first generations of translators &lsquo;decided&rsquo; to translate &lsquo;puja&rsquo; as &lsquo;worship&rsquo; because they were convinced that we are &lsquo;idolaters&rsquo; and &lsquo;worshipped&rsquo; the Devil and his minions. So, you see, we have to discuss the historical issues involving colonialism and what it means to a culture like ours in order to satisfactorily resolve the issues of translation. That is all I am saying. Shall we do so? Have your read &lsquo;<a href="http://sites.google.com/site/colonialconsciousness/theheatheninhisblindness" rel="noopener">The Heathen in his blindness: Asia, the West and the dynamic of religion</a>
&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus I can go on sketching several other scenarios of the possible conversational moves open to Wendy in conducting such a conversation. In none of them can she induce the <em>cognitive wrongness</em> that was induced in me when I was a boy of 14. She simply does not have the cognitive ability to come up with an explanation that can trivialize my experience <em>any more</em>. Let me just pen a few reflections about this state of affairs, because it is very important to realize what has happened <em>consistently</em> throughout these conversations.</p>
<p>(A) The first thing to notice is that, in all these scenarios, I am <em>defining</em> the terms of the debate. She is unable to do this with respect to what <em>I am doing</em>.</p>
<p>(B) I am able to do it <em>because</em> I am knowledgeable about the western culture. That is, I am not ignorant of the western culture the way I was when I was 14 or 24. Therefore, I am able to <em>tell</em> her that she does not understand her <em>own</em> culture as well as I understand hers.</p>
<p>(C) My principle of charity forbids me from transforming any culture, whether hers or mine, into a <em>bunch of idiots</em>. My conversational move in (5&rsquo;) makes me <em>defend</em> the Jewish, Islamic, and Christian cultures because of this principle. Of course, the same principle makes me defend Indian traditions as &lsquo;reasonable&rsquo; ones too.</p>
<p>(D) I am not making use of any fancy defensive &rsquo;explanation&rsquo; - some or another kind of &lsquo;symbolic&rsquo; explanation - (or even any &rsquo;explanation&rsquo;) that many Indians come up with to defend their own traditions. Such &rsquo;explanations&rsquo; arise out of ignorance: both of their own traditions and, above all, <a href="/hipkapi/posts/why-understand-the-western-culture-s-n-balagangadhara/">of the western culture</a>
. They have very little <em>understanding</em> of the subjects they talk about, but the &lsquo;conviction&rsquo; they know what is there to know is matched by none. Most English-speaking Indian intellectuals are a pompous and empty lot: they talk and argue for the sake of doing so, and believe that &lsquo;knowledge&rsquo; is a matter of providing citations and references to books. (I will be writing the article I promised you, as an answer to your question, where I will take up this issue in some detail.) But they have no depth of understanding regarding either their own traditions or those of the West. They are like the JNU &lsquo;intellectuals&rsquo;: empty, sanctimonious, convinced of their own intelligence, but full of hot air.</p>
<p>(E) To understand my mother, I needed to understand my mother-in-law. What you see in my imaginary conversation with Wendy is an exemplification of this realization.
