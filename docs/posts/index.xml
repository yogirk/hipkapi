      <title>How to read Gita?</title>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If you insist that without situating Gita in the massive text that Mahabharata is, we cannot understand or interpret Gita, then you provide such a gigantic &lt;em&gt;con&lt;/em&gt;-text to the 18 chapters that the Gita is, and because a move like this can only give interpretations of a small text by situating in such a huge &lt;em&gt;con&lt;/em&gt;-text, any and almost every interpretation can become valid or acceptable or permissible. We will have on our hands a plethora of interpretations, many in conflict with the other, so that we cannot even decide whether there is even one or some interpretation(s) that is (are) better than the other. We end up formulating an impossible problem: which interpretation to choose and why? We cannot appeal to the implicit goal present in text interpretations, viz., consistency and completeness nor to criterion like coherence (because it is unclear what coherence would consist of in this case).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Suppose that you ask the following question instead: which other texts (that is, &lt;em&gt;con&lt;/em&gt;-texts) do we need to read and understand the two articles on relativity? We do need background knowledge to draw some possible implications from these articles, but what &lt;em&gt;con&lt;/em&gt;-texts do we need? Which con-texts are needed to study Feynman’s Lectures, or Darwin’s origin or similar works in the natural sciences? Some knowledge is required; some skills are necessary; we must be able to read a natural language, etc., but these are not &lt;em&gt;con&lt;/em&gt;-texts but requirements to acquire knowledge.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Suppose further that you see the Gita as a text that imparts knowledge. (I will leave out the question what that knowledge could be.) Suppose too that there are prerequisites to acquire this knowledge, as is the case with knowledge. And that we can evaluate and judge the Gita as knowledge as well. Which insurmountable problem does such an approach create? One might not be able to read the Gita and acquire the knowledge it imparts by just knowing a natural language. However, that would apply to all knowledge, would it not? You will not understand the relativity theories just because you can read those articles in, say, the original or in a faithful translation. A popular commentary that ‘explains’ these papers will not make you a physicist either. What hinders us from looking at the Gita this way? What objections are there for such an approach?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In fact, if you look at most claims made about the Gita (Sen, Doniger, Danto, etc.), you notice that they look at the Gita either as a literary text, or as a quasi-moral or philosophical text, or as a religious text etc. I have not come across a single interpretation of even the first chapter of the Gita that goes beyond these approaches and almost all of them tell the same story: Arjuna was despondent or felt extremely sad that he must kill (his relatives) on the battlefield and the 17 chapters of the Gita are there to ‘comfort’ him. How do they do so? The acts and consequences story is one answer. Here are my naïve questions: why write 17 chapters just to say ‘karmanyevadhikaraste…’? After all, this thought is exactly one verse long and, in fact, it is written out in the Gita. What do the other verses do? How, exactly, do these 17 chapters ‘comfort’ Arjuna and ‘therapeutically’ cure his despondency? I have not read anyone either raising these questions or answering them. (I confess that I have not read many commentaries. I am glad about this.) How does the fourth chapter (on Jnanyoga) answer any of the questions that Arjuna raises in the first chapter; what are the answers to those questions; and how exactly do these answers remove Arjuna’s despondency?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Such and many other questions arise if and only if you do not see the Gita as a literary, moral, philosophical, or religious text. If you see it as a knowledge text, these and many more questions arise to which the Gita attempts to give an answer. If one takes such an approach, I see its con-&lt;em&gt;text&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;adding&lt;/em&gt; (in some of the Parvas) explications, clarifications and reasonings that are present in extremely abbreviated forms in the Gita.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;</description>

      <title>Indian education system is a social parasite</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You ask: “(a) Do you mean Islamic colonial rule affected our attitude towards knowledge (how we learn)? And (b) How do we fix the colonial era bureaucracy?” Because of their relevance, my answer is posted on the forum.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To begin answering these huge questions, we must look at the world in terms of “&lt;em&gt;tendencies&lt;/em&gt;” (both social and cultural) &lt;em&gt;at a high level of abstraction&lt;/em&gt;. An example of what it looks like.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Accessing knowledge through past theories</title>
      <link>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/past-theories-and-knowledge/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/past-theories-and-knowledge/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;You raise the question whether using earlier theories, which are &lt;em&gt;superseded&lt;/em&gt; by newer theories, one can (or even could ever) access knowledge? (I am not a physicist, but I do not think that physicists have junked Newtonian theories. I think that Newtonian physics retains its validity in the macroworld we live in and is not considered false. As far as I remember, I have not come across writings that claim that Newton’s theory is false but that most of its consequences (but not all) are derivable in Einsteinian theory, under some ‘limiting conditions’ (like mass remaining invariant, etc.) Anyway, I do not know enough Physics to enter a discussion about it. Arun and Kannan are more competent here than I am.) If we do not get stuck on any one example, it appears to me that there are three questions here: (a) Could defective, incomplete, partial theories help us access knowledge?; (b) Could false, or partially false and partially true, theories help us access knowledge?; (c) Was knowledge ever accessed by past theories, which, as we know today, expressed ignorance?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Pudgala</title>
      <link>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/pudgala/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You say: “&amp;lsquo;person + Indriya + Manas  is the Bhokta&amp;rsquo; renders the sentence meaningless to me.” While that could be true, that sentence makes (and made) perfect sense to millions (over the last two millennia) on earth. Would it help if it read instead: “soul + Indriya + Manas  is the Bhokta; ” or “my inner self + Indriya + Manas  is the Bhokta” or “ the pudgala + Indriya + Manas  is the Bhokta” or any such combination? If it does, then I do not see why ‘person’ would make the sentence meaningless; person is used as a synonym here. Moreover, if using ‘atman’ makes the sentence meaningful (irrespective of, as you put it, “whatever it be’), what is the problem if the word ‘person’ is used to translate ‘atman’? If the meaning problem re-emrges, it must lie in what you think the ‘person’ is, is it not?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Are you raising a translation issue (how to translate dehinaH) here? It means ‘bodied’, ‘that which is bodied” (whatever that may be, to use your phrase). If you have knowledge of what ‘that’ (tat) is, you might say that it ‘has’ a body, it ‘possesses a body’, it ‘owns’ the body, it is ‘in’ the body, etc., depending on whether ‘thatness’ (tatva) is capable of ‘having’, or ‘owning’ or ‘possessing’ and is ‘indwelling’ and so on.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;As you can see, it is actually a knowledge issue about ‘tat’ (that) and ‘tatva’ (thatness). You can be a tatva darshi (one who has seen ‘thatness’) but yet not be a gyaani (i.e., not have the knowledge of what tatva is).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In my talk that you refer to, I raise a question about a knowledge issue. Is atman ‘inside’ the body, i.e., does dehinaH mean ‘embodied’ or is it merely ‘the bodied’ in the second chapter of the Gita?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;II&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Western intellectuals are not idiots</title>
      <link>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/western-intellectuals-are-not-idiots/</link>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;He says: &amp;ldquo;Doniger translates &amp;ldquo;dharma&amp;rdquo; as &amp;ldquo;religion&amp;rdquo;. Apparently, Indians should not criticize that because we know neither what the English word &amp;ldquo;religion&amp;rdquo; means nor do we know what &amp;ldquo;dharma&amp;rdquo; means because neither English nor Sanskrit is our mother tongue.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;First of all I do not say or imply that Indians &lt;em&gt;should not criticize&lt;/em&gt; the translation. I merely point out that (a) there is indeterminacy in translation across two languages and &lt;em&gt;therefore&lt;/em&gt; (b) we can only make &amp;lsquo;qualitative&amp;rsquo; criticisms. That is to say, one must suggest &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; the word &amp;ldquo;Dharma&amp;rdquo; should be translated in all those different contexts that Doniger translates it as &amp;ldquo;Religion&amp;rdquo;. Otherwise, the criticism (&amp;ldquo;that it is not an &amp;lsquo;accurate&amp;rsquo; translation&amp;rdquo;) is bogus.&#xA;Secondly, I did not say nor imply that we&lt;em&gt;do not know&lt;/em&gt; the meaning of &amp;ldquo;religion&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;dharma&amp;rdquo;. That is, I did not claim that these two words are just as intelligible to us as the words &amp;lsquo;pif-paf&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;paf-paf&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;He further says: &amp;ldquo;We may have the word dharma in Hindi but it may mean something different in Sanskrit. Besides, both these words are ambiguous &amp;ndash;another reason we can&amp;rsquo;t criticize the translation since we don&amp;rsquo;t know all the shades of meaning of &amp;ldquo;religion&amp;rdquo; nor of &amp;ldquo;dharma&amp;rdquo;. Similarly when &amp;ldquo;brahmin&amp;rdquo; is translated as &amp;ldquo;priest.&amp;rdquo;  Of course Doniger could have translated &amp;ldquo;dharma&amp;rdquo; as &amp;ldquo;perversion&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;brahmin&amp;rdquo; as &amp;ldquo;idiot&amp;rdquo; and since we don&amp;rsquo;t know what &amp;ldquo;perversion&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;idiot&amp;rdquo; mean either, we couldn&amp;rsquo;t really criticize that as well.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Again, I did not claim nor did I imply that we must know &amp;ldquo;all shades of meaning&amp;rdquo; (whatever that means in the present context) in order to translate. Nor does it follow from anything I have said that one could then use &lt;em&gt;any word&lt;/em&gt; in one language to translate &lt;em&gt;any word&lt;/em&gt; from another language.&#xA;That there is indeterminacy of meaning in translation does not entail that one denies that words have meanings, surely. Words occur in a language and a language has rules, conventions, dictionaries, and such like. It has a syntax, semantics and pragmatics of communication. Who has denied this? Quine has not; nor have I.&#xA;It is the linguistic convention to translate &amp;lsquo;dharma&amp;rsquo; as religion and &amp;lsquo;brahmin&amp;rsquo; as &amp;lsquo;priest&amp;rsquo;. One cannot fulminate against this centuries-old practice unless one comes up with alternatives and shows why the alternative is &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; than the centuries-old practice. Until such stage is reached, wisdom counsels us to keep quiet. To reach such a stage, &lt;strong&gt;it is not Sanskrit or English that one should study&lt;/strong&gt; but the relevant phenomena in the world to build a theory about the phenomenon in question.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The subsequent paragraph simply repeats the same misunderstanding without understanding &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/indians-barren-criticisms-of-western-translations/&#34;&gt;my post&lt;/a&gt;. Of course, to understand my post and react to that, the presupposition is that one has read what linguists and philosophers of language have written about meaning and use. If one has not done this work, and has merely some vague common-sense ideas about translation, then one should have the minimal humility to keep quiet and not attack Doniger&amp;rsquo;s translation.&#xA;This, then, is the &amp;ldquo;point of my argument&amp;rdquo;. Do not think that western intellectuals are idiots and imbeciles. Being an Indian and a native speaker of some Indian language does not give you some marvelous ability to criticize the western intellectuals based on your common-sense ideas about the world. People like Wendy have put in years of serious effort to learn languages and theories and if one wants to take them on, one must make sure that one is their intellectual match. And that requires years (if not decades) of dedicated work. That is the &amp;ldquo;point of my argument&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;</description>

      <title>Spirituality = Adhyatma?</title>
      <link>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/spirituality-adhyatma/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/spirituality-adhyatma/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One could justifiably see spirituality (the Jewish, Christian and Islamic) as ‘Adhyatma’ if one focusses on the psychological transformations that a human being undergoes in the process of moving from the mundane life to a ‘spiritual’ one. You would be closer to the notion of ‘Adhyatma’ if you can also additionally guide such a process. Such guidance requires, of course, that there is some deep understanding of such transformative processes and their mechanisms.&#xA;Yet, I would be hesitant to suggest that ‘spirituality’ translates ‘adhyatma’ or the other way round. From among the many reasons, I pick three:&#xA;(a) because the weight of the word ‘spirituality’ is drawn from Christianity, i.e., the kind of transformative force on a human being that we have in mind is the work of the ‘holy spirit’, it would be inappropriate to translate ‘adhyatma’ as ‘spirituality’;&#xA;(b) it is difficult to characterize the changes in human beings that we are talking about by using this word in Islam and Judaism as well. There is no ‘holy spirit’ in these two religions that does the work of the Trinitarian holy spirit;&#xA;(c) since a ‘spiritual’ person is the result of the workings of the holy spirit, in the context of Adhyatma which insists that transformations are the results of human phenomena working on human beings, the use of this word would be inappropriate. Both the Christian and the Adhyatmic use militates against such a translation.&#xA;In short, no, we should not translate ‘spirituality’ as ‘adhyatma’.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Peoples and Nations</title>
      <link>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/peoples-and-nations/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 29 Mar 2023 09:39:21 +0530</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/peoples-and-nations/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Ancient Romans spoke of ‘Peoples’ and ‘Nations’. They saw traditions making a group into a people and distinguishing people (and, sometimes, ‘nations’) from each other. Different peoples (distinguished from each other on the basis of ancestral traditions) could live together in a nation and a nation itself could host multiple peoples and traditions. Consequently, they did not see Christians as a people because they did not have ancestral traditions to follow.&#xA;The Christians redefined what it is to be a people: they became a ‘communitas’ (a community) because of their ‘religio’. The Christians became a community because they were united “in God” and “in Christ”. They were united too in their “search for God”, which was what “conversio” (‘conversion’) meant to them. Christians were a ‘people’ now, a community that came into existence by their ‘unity in Christ’. The idea that individuals are “united” in “God and Christ” is what brings about a community and thus a people. This is a very Christian idea, which is based on the thought that individuals are united only in God. When secularized, it takes the shape of the idea that “a people” have a “common religion”. Or that every people is a people (or becomes one) because of religion.&#xA;It is this direction that one will have to go. I am working this idea out (every now and then) in my attempt to build a foundation for a theory of comparative politics, where I contrast these Christain ideas with the Indian ones.&#xA;II&#xA;One is the meaning of ‘nation-state’, which is also abbreviated in colloquial use as ‘nation’. This picks out individual countries with physical borders that have sovereign states internally: U.S., India, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, etc are such nation-states.&#xA;The second idea, which has a venerable history of more than 2000 years, is one which sees ‘nation’ as a ‘people’. In that sense the Jews are a ‘nation’ as are the Christians (as they saw themselves earlier and many, even now) and Muslims. Both the Muslims and the British saw a ‘Hindu’ nation in India as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Ontology of Jain authors: Ramayana</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am not sure what the discussions are about. Here are some of the problems that have surfaced.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Do (did) people in India believe that Ramayana is (was) a narration of &amp;lsquo;what really happened&amp;rsquo;? Even without specifying the &amp;lsquo;when&amp;rsquo; and the &amp;lsquo;where&amp;rsquo;, the answer is obvious: some (did) do; some (did) do not; some are agnostic. The question, however, is: What is the question about? What problem is it meant to solve? Does the answer I give solve any problem? If it does not, that shows that this is not the issue at stake. So, what is the issue then?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Can we talk about truth in Fiction? (The example of Holmes.) Yes, we can and do so very regularly, not only in common parlance but also in literary studies. However, the issues are: how should we understand this way of talking (there is controversy about it) and why is this relevant to Ramayana?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Did some Indians begin a discussion about the existence of Ramasethu and the temple of Rama in Ayodhya (of today) only relatively recently? Yes, I think so. I do not know of any discussion that occurred on this issue, say, a thousand years ago. Again, what is the problem?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Did Indians have no notion of the &amp;rsquo;truth of Ramayana&amp;rsquo; before their contact with non-heathen cultures? This is an ill-formed question, as far as I am concerned, because it is unclear what counts as an answer. Equally, it is unclear what the question is about: (a) is it about the Indian notions of &amp;rsquo;truth&amp;rsquo;? (b) is it about the &amp;rsquo;truth&amp;rsquo; of historiography? (c) Is it about the relation between &amp;lsquo;belief about the truth of historiography&amp;rsquo; and the &amp;rsquo;truth of historiography&amp;rsquo; independent of people&amp;rsquo;s beliefs about its truth?&#xA;These are merely some of the questions that have surfaced. May I request that we resume the threads with clear problem statements so that we can make some headway?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;II&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Balagangadhara, emeritus professor at Ghent University, Belgium, has spent more than 40 years studying the science of cultures, especially Western culture, which was deeply influenced by Christianity, and how this framework was used to understand Indian culture, where it was a colonising power. In the process, our British colonial masters’ understanding of Indian traditions, religion and the ‘caste system’ impacted how we, the colonised, began to see ourselves even after 1947.&#xA;His latest book, &lt;em&gt;What Does It Mean To Be ‘Indian’?&lt;/em&gt;, written in collaboration with Sarika Rao, examines how the Islamic and British colonialisms interfered with our understanding of the world and experiences, thus leaving us with several unanswered questions on what it really means to be Indian in the twenty-first century.&#xA;S.N. Balagangadhara’s books and essays include &lt;em&gt;Cultures Differ Differently, Reconceptualizing Indian Studies&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Do All Roads Lead to Jerusalem? The Making of Indian Religions&lt;/em&gt;(co-authored with Divya Jhingran), and &lt;em&gt;The Heathen in His Blindness: Asia, The West, and the Dynamic of Religion&lt;/em&gt;. His students have explored his themes in another book, &lt;em&gt;Western Foundations of The Caste System&lt;/em&gt;(edited by Martin Farek, Dunkin Jalki, Sufiya Pathan, and Prakash Shah).&#xA;In a conversation with Dr Balagangadhara, both over email and in a face-to-face discussion over Zoom, &lt;em&gt;Swarajya&lt;/em&gt;’s R Jagannathan discussed his book &lt;em&gt;What does it mean to be ‘Indian’?&lt;/em&gt;, including the ideas contained in it, and areas for future research. The following is the first part of the Q&amp;amp;A with S.N. Balagangadhara.&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;Swarajya: Does your book &lt;em&gt;‘What Does It mean to Be ‘Indian’?’&lt;/em&gt; seek answers to the question “Who were we as a people before Islamic and British colonialism entered the picture?”&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;**S N Balagangadhara:**No. *What Does It Mean to Be ‘Indian’?*does not speak of some pre-colonial, ‘pristine’ Indian culture. *What Does It Mean to Be ‘Indian’?*is about what it means to be a part of Indian culture in the twenty-first century. The two colonialisms are parts of our past; they cannot be undone or erased. Colonialisms happened and they impacted us. The goal is to understand how they did so and find ways of dealing with them. That is the reason I spend much time on issues like colonialism, culture, and experience.&#xA;However, what the impacts of colonialisms were and how we responded to them are dependent on how we were as a culture. How the two colonialisms changed us depended on who we were (as a culture) before they colonised us. What Islam did to us is partially how we were before that event and British colonialism’s impact depended on what we had become before they colonised us. We were never passive victims; our culture defined (partially) what the colonisers were able to do.&#xA;There is more research to be done, but thus far we know that colonialism creates colonial consciousness which impedes our access to experiences — not at a generic, abstract level but at an individual level. It is something that you and I, our parents, and our children have.&#xA;It is important to reiterate that this book is not peddling cheap identity politics. As I explicitly say:&#xA;“I do not plot cultural differences along geographical, or linguistic or religious lines. Thus, belonging to Indian culture is how we use or deal with the resources of socialization in India. This would mean that belonging to this or that religion does not differentiate people as members of a culture: one could belong to Indian culture whether a Jain, Buddhist, or a Hindu in exactly the same way a Christian or a Muslim is Indian. This accords with what we see in India: a Konkani-speaking Muslim in Mumbai is as much an Indian as a Kannada-speaking Christian in Mangalore, and as a Tamil-speaking Brahmin in Bangalore.”&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;2: You state that colonialism, apart from violence and subjugation, does things to your mind whereby you no longer have access to your own way of experiencing life through your own learnt cultural interpretations. You see everything through the lens provided by the coloniser. My question is: this seems to matter only if the process of colonisation is incomplete, that is we have been outwardly colonised and alienated from our culturally-embedded instincts, but still know that something is amiss about ourselves. But what if we were, say, fully colonised like the pagans of Europe by Christianity? Today’s Christians are all descendants of those early pagan communities, who now fully see their identities as Christian, not pagan. I mean: does colonisation and self-alienation matter only if we are half-colonised, where we still have memories of what we were earlier?&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;The claim is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;that we are not accessing our own way of experience. Rather, we are not accessing our experience. Period. (Read the chapter “India and her Traditions: An Open letter to Jeffrey Kripal”, in my 2012 book, &lt;em&gt;Reconceptualizing Indian Studies,&lt;em&gt;to understand in an abbreviated form what it means to speak of accessing our experience.)&#xA;Also, it is not true to say that we “see everything through the lens provided by the coloniser”. The lens that Indians use(d) is different from what the Africans or the Native Americans use(d), even though these people were also colonised. The lens we ‘use’ is ‘made in India’, even if the ‘technology’ is western.&#xA;Further, the two processes, Christianisation and colonisation, should not get mixed up. Christianisation is the process of converting populations into Christianity. It is a massive socio-cultural process. The British colonised us but did not Christianise us. In fact, though some missionaries wanted it, the British did not even try to do this. According to some estimates, the Christianisation of Europe itself was only completed by the fifteenth century. In fact, according to me, the Protestant Reformation signaled that the Christianisation of Europe was completed by then.&#xA;And we still don’t know why the Roman Empire fell, what happened to the pagans in Rome when Christianity emerged. I develop a partial hypothesis in the second chapter of my first book &lt;em&gt;The Heathen in his Blindness&lt;/em&gt;… (1994).&#xA;Other than that, here are some further thoughts: I think India was already a mature culture when it was colonised. Perhaps, a passing thought is required to say what I mean by a ‘mature’ culture here. The successful and complete Christianisation of (western) Europe can at least partially be connected to the native cultures that Christianity encountered when it went west of Rome to proselytise. In India, there was very little Semitic religions could offer that would trump what was already present: from the abstract Parabrahma to sophisticated literature, arts, and philosophy; from various types of rituals and traditions to a plurality of routes to ‘spirituality’. Such a culture could tame and absorb some of the tendencies of Semitic religions without being overwhelmed.&#xA;Colonialism damaged our culture in the sense that it damaged the &lt;em&gt;transmission&lt;/em&gt; of Indian culture and the formation of our intellectuals. Even in this process, Indian culture didn’t passively undergo the damage. In turn, it also impacted and changed those that entered it. Indian Islam and Indian Christianity are different from what they are in their native soil. Evangelical Christians and madrassas are trying to change this Christianity and Islam in India into something which they believe is ‘the template’ for these religions.&#xA;Finally. At the stage our knowledge is in, we cannot speak of complete or incomplete colonialism because we have no metric using which we can measure either the degrees or the extent of colonialism. Conversion to Christianity did not make Indians either partially or completely colonial: The Church of South India (including the other dioceses that are conglomerated there) is not a colonising institution, even if colonialism established it (in some sense). Madras Christians are not really all that different &lt;em&gt;culturally&lt;/em&gt; from Mudaliyars or other similar groups in Tamil Nadu.&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;3: Can you explain your statement that India was colonised first by a religion (Islam) and later by the British (but not Christianity). The latter is easily understood, since it involved subjugation and direct intervention in our civil and social lives, but how does one explain colonisation by a religion? Or is it that Islam first colonises the minds of its own faithful and then they do the rest?&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;I have not gone into this question in the book because it requires that one understands my theory of religion and &lt;em&gt;how a religion secularises itself&lt;/em&gt;. This is a very long topic. Thus, I can only say in this answer that the claim that Islam colonised us can be made intelligible and is defensible. It is not ‘easy’ to understand it because religion is not an easy phenomenon for us to understand. All you need to know at this stage is that while it is true that people subjugate people, so does a religion. The latter’s colonisation is an entirely different process from conversion into a religion.&#xA;Colonising India is the secularising moment of Islam as a religion, but not in its phase of religious conversion. The British colonised us but not their Christianity (i.e., British colonialism was &lt;em&gt;not a&lt;/em&gt;process of &lt;em&gt;Christianisation&lt;/em&gt;), whereas it was not the Arabs or Persians who colonised us but Islam. The &lt;em&gt;process of Islamification&lt;/em&gt;was carried out by a very weakly secularised religion. (Or) Islam secularises itself through Islamification whereas Christianity secularises itself in a de-Christianised form. These two processes, Christianisation and Islamification, are different in kind and these do not qualify as a process of &lt;em&gt;religious conversion&lt;/em&gt;into these religions.&#xA;Superficially speaking, Islamification looks very much like religious conversion, but it is not. The violent subduing of socio-cultural phenomena and attempts to deform them make this phase (or aspect) of Islam different from religious conversion. Conversion is an individual religious process, whereas Islamification is a secularisation process at a social scale driven by violence. (&lt;em&gt;I cannot explain these distinctions and thoughts here, in this answer, because it requires a very long explanation&lt;/em&gt;).&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;4: My own hunch is that British colonisation was built on top of Islam’s brutal and contemptuous regard for Indian culture. Thus, when the British came, many Indians were willing to see them as saviors from Islam’s brutalities. This made it easy for us to think that the way forward is to think like them. Raja Ram Mohan Roy, for example, wanted to model his Brahmo Samaj more or less like a Hindu version of Christianity…Your comment.&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;My previous answer hints at a possible explanation of your hunch, viz., “Islam’s brutal and contemptuous regard for Indian culture”. Surely, we must explain this phenomenon: why should Islam, or any religion for that matter, regard a culture (any culture) brutally and contemptuously? Even the most ‘other-worldly’ orientation seeks music, hymns, and ennobling visualisations. That being the case, how to understand your hunch? Since you are not alone in thinking this, as scientists, we must come up with a plausible (and hopefully true) solution to the problem. Currently, I think I am very close to a satisfactory solution, which I have only hinted at in my previous answer.&#xA;Many things emerge at the crossover points where religion and tradition meet and impact each other. Movements such as the Arya Samaj or Prarthana Samaj are some such. They modelled themselves on the Protestant Reformation (as Indians understood ‘reformation’, of course) with a goal to ‘reform’ Hinduism. The nature and tenor of the Protestant theologies which they encountered defined their themes and determined their responses. However, I do not think that Raja Ram Mohan Roy (and others) wanted to be like the Protestants because the British fought Islamic rulers. The reasons must be sought elsewhere and not in their possible individual psychologies, because it fails to explain why many other and different psychologies followed these movements. Surely, we cannot explain or understand the ‘popularity’ of Arya Samaj today by appealing to this psychological explanation.&#xA;No matter how Indians looked at the British (as saviors or whatever), this attitude does not explain colonialism. In the South, for instance, Tipu Sultan, the ‘Tiger of Mysore’, is praised because he fought the British. Tipu was known as a very cruel king, but he is celebrated as the hero who resisted the British invasion. There is a ‘Tipu Sultan’ day, a festival day, that the Congress party introduced into the state.&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;5: You say that there is no such thing as Hinduism, but we can accept that there are Hindus of various kinds. In short, we are Hindus in a geographical-cultural sense, but there is no religion called Hinduism, which was the result of colonial understanding and interventions. Is this what you want to say?&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;Balagangadhara:&lt;/strong&gt; Science develops because it tries to understand phenomena in the world. Scientific progress happens when old theories are superseded by better theories. That is how we gain knowledge. Just because new scientific theories develop, it doesn’t mean that the phenomenon that they are talking about disappears. For example, the miasma theory of disease which was believed to be true for more than a millennium was superseded by the germ theory of disease. This does not mean that diseases or their causes disappeared. We just developed a better understanding of the phenomenon.&#xA;‘India has a native religion, and that religion is called Hinduism’ is one story about India and her culture. This story is 400 years old. I challenge that claim and show through scientific research that it is not correct. But because one hypothesis about India is replaced by another, it does not mean that Indians don’t exist or that Indian culture disappears.&#xA;Do Hindus (as cultural groups) exist? Yes, and they are not geographical groups: Hindus exist as a group in many geographies and not only in what we call India. This is not a modern-day phenomenon: Hindus were known to exist in Jambudweepa, Gandhara, Khambhoja, etc., for instance. Are they Hindus because they are a part of Hinduism &lt;em&gt;as a religion&lt;/em&gt;? My answer is no. This answer has nothing to do with how the Semitic religions ‘define’ religion. The question is: does Hinduism as a religion exist as a phenomenon in the world? My answer is no. However, whether Hinduism is a phenomenon in the world or not, this ‘fact’ is independent of the question what the word ‘religion’ means in our languages.&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;6: So, similarly, we can say that castes (or &lt;em&gt;jatis&lt;/em&gt;) exist, but not a caste system. That there may be Brahmins, but Brahminism is a concoction.&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;Absolutely. &lt;em&gt;Jatis&lt;/em&gt; are social groups in Indian society. Social groups exist in all societies and in India these social groups are called ‘&lt;em&gt;jatis&lt;/em&gt;’. &lt;em&gt;Similar&lt;/em&gt; social groups that exist in societies are called differently in different parts of the world. It is as sensible to speak of ‘the caste system’ in India as it is to say that there is ‘the social group system’ in societies. Further, yes, Brahminism is an invention of western Indology. Indology which is fond of ‘-isms’ has created quite a few: Brahminism, Vedism, Hinduism, Buddhism, and so on.&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;7: Religion is difficult to define, but traditions, rituals and practices are clearer to acknowledge. Tradition needs no justification, unless it offends basic human good sense in this day and age. But is there a danger in reducing all of Indian knowledge, metaphysics, philosophy, spiritualism, even science, to just tradition and not call it a religion? After all, isn’t Hinduism partly a religion even as defined by the West?&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;I will start with the simplest point first. As far the West is concerned, Hinduism is not ‘partly’ a religion: according to them, Hinduism is &lt;em&gt;fully&lt;/em&gt; a religion. Period. The West is not denying that Hinduism is a religion. In fact, they have always claimed that it is. So, when Indians jump up and down and claim that they too have religion and that it is called ‘Hinduism’, Western commonsense and academia are in complete agreement. They don’t understand why Indians are proclaiming this very old consensus as though it is a revolutionary new discovery.&#xA;Now, the second part of the answer. You say that “there is a danger of reducing” everything to “just tradition”. And that, surely, Hinduism is “at least partly a religion”. This issue is worth focusing on.&#xA;The first thing to notice is that there is an anxiety involved in trying to identify Hinduism as a ‘religion’. The anxiety is not about understanding religion. The concern is also not to understand what ‘Hinduism’ is. The anxiety is in gaining agreement with the opinion that ‘Hinduism’ is a ‘religion’— at least ‘partly’. People don’t know why, but they are convinced that it is bad if someone says Hinduism is not a religion. Why? Where did this conviction come from that all human cultures must have religion, whether in primitive or in an advanced form, whether as a ‘natural religion’ or as ‘sophisticated spirituality’? One might tweak the definitions in any which way, but one wants to make sure that the result is that ‘all human cultures have religion’. This is something we must pause and look at.&#xA;The idea that ‘religion is a cultural universal’ is a belief in Christianity and Islam. With the process of secularisation, this belief has spread into commonsense and social science. This belief has become so ‘obvious’ that we have an entire cottage industry studying the ‘evolutionary biological explanation for religion’. Therefore, I say that many social scientific insights are simply universalisations of the experiences of one culture, namely that of the West.&#xA;The idea that ‘religion is universal’ is not only an obvious unquestioned ‘fact’ but to question it is also considered offensive. My first book (1994) looks at European culture, and the phenomenon of religion, and I develop a theory of religion. I show that what we do not have is a definitional problem. It is about developing a scientific theory of a phenomenon X and seeing whether other phenomena like H or P are also the same or not. The book also explains why the West thinks that religion is a cultural universal.&#xA;The other thing to notice is that by identifying one phenomenon, we do not ‘reduce’ any other thing. Just because I say that the water you see in a desert is a ‘mirage’ and ‘not photosynthesis’, it does not mean that all kinds of other things ‘get reduced’ to mirage. Why would they? Likewise, just because I say that we have ‘tradition’ and ‘not religion’, everything cannot ‘get reduced’ to tradition. Philosophy, linguistics, grammar, psychology, science, medicine, etc. are other things and they don’t get reduced to religion or tradition.&#xA;Religion is difficult to define as a word only when there is no theory of religion. The word is defined satisfactorily in a scientific theory of religion. Recognising some practices as ‘traditions’ (or as belonging to a tradition) does not make defining ‘tradition’ any less difficult. For that too, we need a good theory.&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;8: Would you call Buddhism or Jainism or Sikhism also traditions? Or do they pass muster as religions since they do have founders and a set of holy texts like Abrahamic religions? Is it the lack of a founder or “fundamentals” that provides a line separating a religion from just a tradition?&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;I do not say that any phenomenon that has a founder and a set of holy texts is a religion. I do not say this because it is a &lt;em&gt;bad argument&lt;/em&gt;: when we say that ‘Hinduism’ does not have holy books, a founder, etc., the only thing we can say is that ‘Hinduism’ is different from the Semitic religions &lt;em&gt;in this respect&lt;/em&gt;. We cannot say that, &lt;em&gt;therefore&lt;/em&gt;, it is not a religion. I have a hypothesis on what religion is (as a phenomenon in the world) and that is explained in my first book, &lt;em&gt;The Heathen in His Blindness: Asia, the West and the Dynamic of Religion’&lt;/em&gt;. In one sentence, which is difficult to understand in such a brief form, “religion is an ‘explanatory intelligible account’ of the Cosmos and itself”. &lt;em&gt;(This sentence can be read as a definition of religion, but it does not speak about churches, holy books, founders, dogmas, beliefs, etc.)&lt;/em&gt;&#xA;‘Buddhism’ was a discovery (actually, an &lt;em&gt;invention&lt;/em&gt;) of the British. Sikhism is an emergence from the interaction of Indian traditions with Islam. Neither exists in the world as religions. These are Indian traditions.&#xA;I have written on the difference between religion and tradition in my writings. One must understand these two phenomena separately to understand their relationship with each other.&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;9: You seem to want to give our colonisers the benefit of the doubt in terms of intentions. You broadly suggest that they defined us based on their own experiences with the way European Christian history evolved. So, it was natural for them to analyse us in the way they understood reality. But is this the whole story? Didn’t coloniality need them to actively promote internal antagonisms and widen the fault-lines inside India, so that they could rule us with very few people? Didn’t Pakistan, and the widening of the &lt;em&gt;jati&lt;/em&gt; divide, serve their interests?&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;The first sentence in the question captures a prevalent misunderstanding. It says that I speak of the ‘intentions’ of the colonisers. That is not the case. I am not interested in the intentions or the motivations of individual or even groups of Europeans. The reason I do not do that is because: (1) it is not correct to say intentions guide actions. Take the incessant excuse that people give of intended actions and their unintended consequences. I have different ideas about that, but I won’t go into that now. I tackle this issue a bit deeper in chapter 4 of the book &lt;em&gt;Cultures Differ Differently&lt;/em&gt; (2022) or in the book &lt;em&gt;‘The Heathen&amp;hellip;’&lt;/em&gt;. (2) It is very difficult to find out the reasons for an action by a person. Most of the time, individuals themselves don’t know what their reasons are, or why they act the way they do. (3) One of the problems in tightly linking intentions to action is the fact that one and the same action (even a trivial action like opening a door) can be the result of many kinds of intentions (maybe the room is too cold or too warm, maybe I thought someone is standing at the door, maybe I think spies are listening in to my conversation, maybe there is too much cigarette smoke in the room…)&#xA;Like with any person or group, multiple motivations and intentions in a mixed form are present at any given time. To try to crawl into the heads of earlier generations, especially centuries later, to find that which is inscrutable to themselves is to set myself to fail. Or worse, that is to present ignorance as knowledge which I call ‘bullshit’.&#xA;What I do is to make intelligible the consistency and thus the pattern of what the Europeans said about us and how they behaved. My hypothesis is independent of individual psychological differences (because we speak of hundreds of thousands of different people); it does not change with the passage of time (because we speak of a time span of centuries); it does not depend on national borders or geography (after all, the Portuguese, the Dutch and the English belong to different countries); it does not depend on their political inclinations (Liberal or Conservative) or religious proclivities (whether Anglican, Protestant, Catholic). That is, I put the constraints and demands of science on the hypotheses that I formulate. If I do not do this, I am simply one more person expressing one more opinion.&#xA;Discussing motivations, intentions and opinions is an endless process. Look at the number of books produced on colonialism. They have not helped us gain much of an understanding of the phenomenon of colonialism or its effects.&#xA;A scientific hypothesis must make sense of a canonised Catholic priest like (Francis) Xavier and the low-life thugs who made up the mercenaries of the East India Company, as well as bureaucrats like Warren Hastings and Orientalists like William Jones. I find that my hypothesis does it. Whether they abhorred the Savages and wanted to convert them, or whether they were rapine looters who wanted to make money or power-hungry imperialists, their cultural background and their shared Christian framework provided them with certain ideas about human beings, the natural world, and the social world. They used these ideas to make sense of what they went through and encountered in their lives.&#xA;This is what all human beings do. We use our repertoire to make sense of and deal with what we encounter. When Europeans landed on the coasts of Malabar and met Indians, their framework (their culture) provided them with ideas (resources) to make sense of what they saw. One example is the idea that ‘all cultures have religion’. This notion is never questioned, but different possible explanations are given to justify it. ‘False religion’, ‘primitive religion’, ‘magical thinking’, ‘a different kind of religion’, etc., are just the different forms that a justification takes depending on the fashions of the time. But the notion that is never questioned is whether ‘all cultures have religion’.&#xA;I also don’t use words like coloniality and decoloniality in my book. That is another reason for confusion. These words are obfuscating jargon from post-colonialism and post-modernism. These are the worst intellectual products of the twentieth century. In intellectual circles, post-colonials are described as &lt;em&gt;Jammergemeinschaft (&lt;em&gt;in German&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;: a community of whiners who do not contribute to knowledge. Post-modernism goes further and is openly inimical to knowledge. Unfortunately, both have become very widespread and influential. Thus, it is wise not to speak of ‘coloniality’ and ‘decoloniality’.&#xA;To give a short answer: no, I am not giving our colonisers any benefit of doubt, nor am I being soft or apologetic about them. The only focus of my work is to develop scientific knowledge about human beings, culture, and society. A true science of the social.&#xA;Of course, colonialism used many strategies to subjugate a people. This includes the ‘divide and rule’ policy, ‘exacerbating existing fault lines’ and so on. To speak of something (Pakistan, the &lt;em&gt;jati&lt;/em&gt; divide, etc.) as furthering their ‘interests’, we first need to be able to say what those interests are: are we talking about interests (in the plural?) of the British people (of which period?), of the British Anglican Church, of the British Empire, of the East India Company, of the White Race…? Was this plurality of ‘interests’ ever in conflict with one another? If they were, whose or which ‘interests’ did the conflict serve? Which became victorious and why?&#xA;You know, ‘interests’ is such a silly all-encompassing word that we can even say that everything the British did was in their ‘interest’. I would suggest that you think of an Indian linguistic equivalent for this word ‘interest’. You will then see how silly it is to speak of ‘interests’. ‘National security interests’, ‘national interests’, etc., are weasel words with no boundaries.&#xA;Finally, let me formulate a question. True, the British came “with very few people”. We were servile: there too I agree. No question that we behaved like menial servants. But did the British ever “&lt;em&gt;rule&lt;/em&gt;” us? Do we know what either the word means or what it indicates in the real world? This is a teasing question based on the results of my ongoing research. I hope to publish them soon.&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;10: Regarding &lt;em&gt;itihasa&lt;/em&gt; and history, you clearly warn us not to take &lt;em&gt;itihasa,&lt;/em&gt; which is about stories that may or may not have some history attached to them, as history. &lt;em&gt;Itihasa&lt;/em&gt; is about our way of passing on cultural information as stories and may not be history. But why do you suggest that the absence of history writing in India and using &lt;em&gt;itihasa&lt;/em&gt; as history are both colonialisms. After all, don’t we try to understand or deduce history from holy texts like the &lt;em&gt;Rg Veda&lt;/em&gt; or even epics like the &lt;em&gt;Mahabharata&lt;/em&gt;? How is this colonialism?&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;I have written articles on the subject where this question is tackled. (I suggest using my academia.edu website page, which contains most of my writings.) However, I do not say that we can learn nothing about &lt;em&gt;our past&lt;/em&gt; by studying the &lt;em&gt;Vedas&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Puranas&lt;/em&gt;. But I do say that historiography (the &lt;em&gt;graphein&lt;/em&gt; of &lt;em&gt;historia&lt;/em&gt;) is not our way of talking about the past. &lt;em&gt;Itihasa&lt;/em&gt; does this job without being history. Using &lt;em&gt;itihasa&lt;/em&gt; to understand our past is not an expression of a colonial attitude. &lt;em&gt;Using itihasa as history is&lt;/em&gt;.&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;11: You make a very bold — even controversial — claim about truth and knowledge. That “knowledge trumps truth” in our culture. We have a goddess for knowledge, but not truth. For the Abrahamics, truth is revealed by their one and only ‘true God;, and hence they are more obsessed by truth than us. But our national motto says, “Satyamev Jayate” and Gandhi said his whole life was about experiments with truth. How do you explain this contradiction between what we really revere (knowledge) and what we have adopted as national mottos?&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;My answer is colonial consciousness. We learn a way of talking and we use it. This way of talking is unconnected to our experience. We have adopted many things in the formation of the Indian nation-state which are strange. The entire Indian Constitution is an expression of that strangeness.&#xA;A couple of other things. In Christianity, God &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the truth; He does not merely reveal something called ‘the truth’. This truth is an ontological notion (i.e., it is about what there is or exists in the world), whereas the ‘truth’ as we use the word in India is semantic in nature. It is a linguistic property of sentences, mostly. I do not say that the true sentences that we talk and write are unimportant to us; I say that this truth-telling is subordinated to knowledge.&#xA;Gandhi titles his book without knowing what he was talking about. &lt;em&gt;(We must understand his educational and experiential backgrounds, both of which were colonial and Christian, to understand his obsession with ‘the’ truth.)&lt;/em&gt; How does one experiment with truth, or how many &lt;em&gt;kinds of&lt;/em&gt; experiments can we do with it? What does such a formulation or such an activity mean? What kind of experiments can we indulge in? For instance, is lying an ‘experiment with truth’ or is it the opposite of truth-telling? Silly slogans should not replace serious thinking. About ‘Satyameva Jayate’: what does the ‘victory’ of truth mean? Against what? Lies? Why should truth-telling and lying be each other’s enemies? Have we not been taught by our mothers, grandparents, and friends to know how and when to lie? Are we ‘experimenting’ with ‘truth’ in such cases?&#xA;If we were members of Semitic religions, we could make sense of the victory of ‘the truth’, viz, of God. If ‘satya’ were to mean ‘the good’, we can understand the victory of ‘the good’ against evil. What would this mean if truth is a linguistic property of sentences? Of course, ‘Satyamev Jayate’ is a native Indian motto. Here and there, Indian writings hint at the existence of an ontological notion of truth but they became popular only during the British colonialism and under the influence of Protestant Christianity. (&lt;/em&gt;“Ekam Sat…”&lt;/em&gt; is about &lt;em&gt;Sat&lt;/em&gt; but not about &lt;em&gt;satya&lt;/em&gt;, whereas &lt;em&gt;“bahudavadanti”&lt;/em&gt; is about truth-telling.) Thus, the point is that we cannot explain or understand what the victory of &lt;em&gt;satya&lt;/em&gt; is without appealing to Semitic religions today. Do we really need to have a national motto incomprehensible to most of us Indians?&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;12: You define “culture” as combining two things, language, and actions. These exist not only as resources for enabling socialisation, but contain knowledge on how to use and experience these resources. You also say that in Western culture, religion plays an important role and in Indian culture it is rituals and practices. Can you expand on this idea with examples?&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;I have put this across as a possible hypothesis of a phenomenon in chapter 3 of the book ‘&lt;em&gt;What does it mean to be Indian?&lt;/em&gt;’ I have said more in &lt;em&gt;‘The Heathen…’&lt;/em&gt;, and in ‘&lt;em&gt;Reconceptualizing India Studies&lt;/em&gt;’, and in many other articles. I suggest reading them to know more.&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;13: I wonder why you say that Islam and Christianity have adapted to the Indian configurations of learning despite differing belief systems. But you also state that &lt;em&gt;madrassas&lt;/em&gt; and evangelical groups resist this adaptation to Indian cultural configurations. Can you explain this conflict, and why it is so important to understand in the Indian context?&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;All things are influenced by the environment of which they are a part. Religion is no exception. The way Semitic religions evolved in a religious environment like Europe or in the Middle East is different from how the Semitic religions evolved in a non-religious environment like India. Europe or America today are ‘secular’ worlds; a ‘secular’ world in a religious culture is a secularised religious environment.&#xA;Both religions and traditions face different challenges in different environments. Take, for example, the kind of problems faced by NRI Hindus: they are suddenly confronted with new questions and novel situations. So, they adapt to survive in that environment. Or take the Jews: European and Middle Eastern Jews who were victims of relentless persecution evolved differently compared to the Jews who lived peacefully in a non-religious environment like India.&#xA;Thus, Islam and Christianity also changed in India. Today, there is also the growing impact of evangelical Christianity or Wahabism on them. It is a very complex issue with multiple threads, but I think that the increasing hostility and friction between communities in India has to do with the changing nature of these religions. But because we don’t have many intellectuals in India, we don’t have the resources to understand what is happening there. It is one of the biggest tragedies of India: not only do we not have many intellectuals, but we also do not appear to care about producing more of them.&#xA;Your main concern is about the modern-day interaction between Indian culture and these two groups of militant evangelising Christians and the equally militant &lt;em&gt;madrassas&lt;/em&gt;. Note that they are taking place against an India whose culture is losing its vibrancy. To understand this complex pattern of interaction and make a prognosis requires research of a kind that is totally non-existent in India. A moralising talk about the persecution of minority groups in India is the language of the current crop of Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi University and Asoka University people. It gives them ‘fame’ but produces no knowledge.&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;14: It seems likely that colonisation is not always a well-thought-out conspiracy by the coloniser. It is the product of the colonial powers using their own historical lenses to define or describe the colonised, but, at the same time, it also involves a long-term process whereby the colonised people develop a “colonial consciousness”. Why and how did India’s intellectuals start believing that their rulers understood them better than they themselves did? What could have been the triggers for this process?&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;Colonialism is not a conspiracy: no massive social phenomenon is a conspiracy, well thought-out or otherwise.&#xA;I speak about these two questions very briefly in my book, because much of the work on these issues belongs to ongoing research. I am one of the few who have identified and raised this as a question. There is a lot more work to be done before we can answer these questions. In my book, I say:&#xA;“So, we can ask: what made Indians think that the British experience of India describes India the way it is? This issue becomes even more acute because of another claim that I have been developing: one of the characteristic aspects of Indian culture has been its continuous emphasis on reflecting on experience. Thus, Indian intellectuals must have been able to see that what the British were saying about them did not match their own experience. Yet, instead of disagreeing, they acquiesced. What made the Indian intellectuals blind to the nature of their own experience? If we assume that events that occurred in the world are responsible for this, what happened in the past that made the intellectuals of India lose their grip on an essential element of their culture? How could Indian culture have failed in accessing its own experience, when its internal focus was precisely on reflecting on experience?&amp;quot; (p. 84)&#xA;The indicative hypothesis is that Indian culture &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; losing its vibrancy and the nature of her intellectuals must have changed their shape and form during this time. For now, what I say in the book is all I can say. When I die, I can leave behind what I have worked on for 40 years. After all, I am one man (and an old one at that) and the questions are many. There are no easy fruits to pluck, we must plant the trees and tend to them with the hope that our posterity can pluck the fruits.&#xA;Our culture has always placed a huge premium on knowledge. &lt;em&gt;Jnana&lt;/em&gt; and Saraswati are not easily acquired. You ask for examples of the resources of socialisation: our intuitive relationship to Saraswati, &lt;em&gt;vidya&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;jnana&lt;/em&gt; are excellent examples. In any case, a very brief answer can be given. Indians succumbed to the descriptions of the colonisers because Indians were unable to counter them with their native descriptions. The crises in Indian society that preceded Islamic colonialism had weakened the Indian intellectual traditions. The Muslims damaged this weakened culture so that when the British came, our resources were almost exhausted due to a millennium of lack of use and quite some abuse.&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;15: Regarding Islamic colonisation, you say that it enabled the penetration of Islamic themes using Indian terms and concepts. This happened because Indian culture was already losing its vibrancy when Islam came to India… Can you speculate on why we were already losing vibrancy at that time, so that we became easy fodder for Islamic themes to enter our consciousness? How did Islam prevent us from accessing our own experiences?&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;I am still trying to understand this phenomenon fully. This requires research which is still ongoing. It would not be correct to speculate about such serious matters now. As it is, disciplines which claim to study India are full of speculations, conjectures, and pernicious nonsense. I would be very irresponsible (and unethical, to be honest) to add to that.&#xA;However, the following can be safely said. There must have been a huge crisis (maybe, there were many crises) in our culture because of which certain kinds of enquiries died. Certain ‘developments’ in Indian culture about 1,000 years ago were probably responses to crises that we could not adequately meet. That is, not everything that emerged in our culture, even centuries before the Islamic colonialism, indexes our strength; some of these developments could well be expressions of weaknesses. This is a call to seriously study the Indian past, not the way JNU and Delhi University scholars have done until now, but in a scientific manner.&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;16: You make a statement that there is intellectual poverty in already Islamised regions on the Indian sub-continent, in places like Pakistan, Bangladesh and Kashmir. Why do you say this?&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;I say this because it is visible, isn’t it? These regions have not produced any great intellectuals in the last centuries and the environment in these regions is hostile to intellectual development. While people of Pakistan and Bangladesh do flourish and grow when they go to study in other countries, there are no noticeable native intellectuals in these regions.&#xA;In fact, India is heading in the same direction: we don’t have intellectuals and we are not creating them. Irrespective of whether the decline will take the form of economic poverty or not, if things don’t change, the intellectual poverty in India will reach the same level as Pakistan or Bangladesh. For instance, if things in education (both secondary and higher) do not drastically change in the next 15 years, the educational landscape in India will soon resemble that of Black Africa in the 1930s. We simply do have less and less competent teachers in our educational landscape.&#xA;Take the example of the reaction of most Indian intellectuals to the movie &lt;em&gt;The Kashmir Files&lt;/em&gt; and the massive response of ordinary people. If the first aspect demonstrates anything, it lays bare the absolute barrenness of Indian intellectual landscape. I have not read a single reflection or review that even minimally tries to understand what people are responding to when they respond to the movie. Like everything else, this too is another occasion for moralising lectures about communalism, posturing against the imputed hatred the movie apparently propagates combined with expressions of pseudo-horror about an allegedly partial portrayal.&#xA;Very few things can move the entire population like this movie did and I am still thinking about it. And perhaps will also write on the movie. Tragedies or violence are not new, especially when they are in the news every day. So, it cannot be that the overwhelming response of people had only to do with the horrors faced by the Pandits in Kashmir or the treachery of our ruling classes (politicians, intellectuals, and media). Shortly after the movie came out, I saw it in Belgium, I remember telling my daughter that this movie would enter the national consciousness of India.&#xA;I have a feeling that &lt;em&gt;one of the reasons&lt;/em&gt; why this movie has had the kind of impact it has is because it addresses our deeply held intuitions about our culture regarding knowledge, Saraswati, learning and the destructions wrought on it. One of the horrors we experience is to the rape of “&lt;em&gt;Kashimra Puravasini&lt;/em&gt;” there and to her becoming a total alien in her hometown. (One of the first &lt;em&gt;shlokas&lt;/em&gt; we learn as very young children goes thus: &lt;em&gt;Namaste Sharade Devi, Kashimrapuravasini&lt;/em&gt;…)&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;17: Religion expands in two ways: through conversions, and then later by expanding the same ideas through a secularisation of theology. Christianity expands by de-Christianising its format… And this secularisation is brought about by violence. Religion, whether it remains religion of gets secularised, is about “othering” someone or something… Is this what you are trying to say?&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;I don’t speak of ‘othering’. It is a jargon which doesn’t explain anything. To treat someone as ‘the other’ might be bad if they are the same as you and you don’t treat them that way. For example, if one is a Christian, and Christianity says, “we are all children of God”, to treat some people as the ‘other’ might be wrong. But if someone is different from you, your refusal to see and acknowledge that difference is wrong, isn’t it?&#xA;In fact, I say that when the West looks at other cultures, it does not see them as ‘the other’. It sees and thus transforms them into a &lt;em&gt;pale erring variant&lt;/em&gt; of itself. &lt;em&gt;The other becomes another&lt;/em&gt;.&#xA;I do not say that Judaism and Christianity also &lt;em&gt;secularise&lt;/em&gt; themselves through violence. The emphasis on &lt;em&gt;secularising violence&lt;/em&gt; seems truer of Islam. The Semitic religions see ‘Hinduism’ as another religion: false, to boot, but a religion, nevertheless. They see each other as the ‘other’, i.e., as deficient, or defective religions (or heresies).&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;18: You broadly seem to suggest that colonialism seems to have made us strangers to our own access to culture, and also that we simply have not made enough efforts to understand Western culture. Thus, we don’t know how we must respond to colonial ideas when they come back to bite us without our knowledge of it. We say and speak words that display our colonial consciousness. If Western efforts to understand us through their lenses did not bring us much good, why is the reverse process, of our understanding Western culture, going to do us much good? Should we not focus on understanding ourselves first?&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;Today, the ways and means that we possess to understand ourselves, the intellectual frameworks, the concepts, the interconnections between them, the social scientific theories are all entirely built by Europeans. I have shown in my work that they are based much more on &lt;em&gt;their experience&lt;/em&gt; of the world than on how the world is. There are any number of examples: the idea that ‘all cultures have religion’; the idea of a ‘unique self (soul) which all human beings have’; the notion that ‘the caste system characterises Indian society,’ etc.&#xA;So, if we must understand ourselves, we must study the Europeans in very concrete ways. Of course, we will study and understand them as Indians. That is precisely the point. To recognise, first and foremost, that there are cultural differences between us. We must study these to understand the theories we have about human beings. To understand what we say about ourselves when we claim that we too have a religion or pontificate that one must be true to oneself, and that the caste system must be eradicated, we must study the West.&#xA;We must understand the intellectual frameworks and their implications to understand our laws and to learn how to make laws which don’t make a travesty of everything good and just. To understand ourselves, we must understand western culture. Whether we like it or not, colonialism happened, and colonial consciousness exists. The question is how we can get out of it and regain access to our experience. My research programme, “Comparative Science of Cultures”, formulates one way of doing it. We cannot return to a pristine past of pre-colonialism. The question facing us today is ‘what does it mean to be Indian in the 21st century?’&#xA;To know more about the methodology of this approach, which the question raises, the second and third chapter in ‘&lt;em&gt;Reconceptualizing India Studies&lt;/em&gt;’ might help. They explicate my answers and their justifications.&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;19: In a country where “freedom of religion” is written into the constitution, how do we defend Indian/Hindu rights if you do not even define it as a religion? How can law makers even begin to understand the difference between religion and tradition, or the need to protect “majority” rights that are not religious in nature?&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;This is one of the big problems in India. We have no investments in research and development in social sciences. (The UGC does massively fund ideological propaganda by calling it ‘funding social research’.) There are also no institutions (political, legal, educational, or even charitable) which are interested in stimulating novel social scientific research.&#xA;If Hinduism is not a religion and current legal frameworks are primarily structured by Semitic religions, how can non-religious traditions hope to have the protections of law? This is not just a question for ‘Hindus’, but one that is also of crucial importance to other traditions like the native American or African. What would the frameworks or even minimal formulation of law look like which is not Semitic in nature but one which makes space for traditions too?&#xA;To get an idea of enormity of the question: despite decades of experience and knowledge, even a group of gifted intellectuals will have to do four to five years of full-time research to begin answering this question. There have been barely any attempts by Hindus to try and understand themselves, their social and institutional world, and their implications. Even to this day, people think that it is a definitional problem or a semantic discussion. (‘According to us religion is…’ or ‘Abrahamic definition of religion is…’). Our Supreme Court routinely cites the US juridical definitions to decide about cases involving religious disputes in India.&#xA;So, to answer the question about how lawyers can understand and argue about the difference between religion and tradition, first, social scientists must develop at least the beginnings of an alternative legal framework, legal definitions, etc. Second, it is a collaborative research project with people who specialise in the comparative science of cultures, religion and constitutional law and Indian law. Third, out of such a long-term collaborative project, some tangible results like providing a skeletal legal framework for traditions which can be integrated into existing legal structures could emerge. Such a project does not exist.&#xA;Further, to understand our ‘laws’, we must look at who the ‘lawmakers’ are. Could it be seriously suggested that our current crop of MPs and MLAs even understand what they are legislating? Laws are written (the way the Indian Constitution got written) by third-rate bureaucrats in capital cities: neither they nor the ‘legislators’ know what they are doing.&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;20: The need to defend Hindu rights (we don’t even get to run our own temples) have led to a political platform broadly called Hindutva, but social justice warriors want to pit Hinduism against Hindutva and there was even a global conference called to “dismantle Hindutva”. What should our reasoned stand on these issues be, if Hinduism is not even a religion?&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;Those defending Hindutva and those attacking it are both using the same intellectual framework. I have spoken of it in different places, including in “&lt;em&gt;What does it mean to be ‘Indian’?&lt;/em&gt;” (Page 25). If Hinduism does not exist and India has no religion, what does it mean to speak of (Hindu) religious fundamentalism? How then do we understand the phenomenon of Hindutva? (See also my preface in &lt;em&gt;Cultures Differ Differently&lt;/em&gt;.) None of the so-called India-scholars is raising these questions.&#xA;The conference you speak of was a marginal event, organised by academically fringe groups. But it gained wide-spread recognition because of the attention given to it by the people who got attacked by it. It surprises me that the so-called right-wing, in so far as it can be considered a coherent entity, has not realised that it now &lt;em&gt;embodies and implements&lt;/em&gt; the PR strategy of these fringe ‘scholars’: bait ‘Hindutva’ if you want to gain academic approval and social recognition.&#xA;There are two problems in the way the question is asked: (1) One is that there is a “need to defend Hindu rights” which led to the political platform of Hindutva. Yet the ruling party, which is considered Hindutva, has gone much further than the Congress in the appeasement of minorities and instituting welfare schemes. (2) The suggestion is that “social justice warriors want to pit Hinduism against Hindutva”. But the Hindutva, whether in the form of civil organisations or as a political party, has completely bought into social justice ideology. (When people claim that the victory of the BJP in the recent elections is the result of a “pro-poor” policy of the government, or that BJP wants to win the elections to promote ‘socially just’ policies, one is enthusiastically espousing social justice slogans. Such people are also the &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; social justice &lt;em&gt;warriors&lt;/em&gt; in India.)&#xA;The growth of social justice ideology and its conflation with political correctness is relatively new in the West. But the poisonous combination of identity politics, social justice and political correctness has existed in India for decades. The reservation system which has ballooned out-of-control, the atrocities act, etc., are expressions of social justice ideology promoted and encouraged also by the current ruling party. Hindutva is doing more to promote ‘social justice’ warriors than Congress and its allies ever did. And yet, academic fringe groups sell the idea (which the Right strengthens) that there is ‘caste atrocity’ and ‘minority insecurity’ in India under the BJP, while the current ruling party is the best defender and protector of the so-called ‘Dalits’ and ‘minority religious groups’.&#xA;It might be interesting to note that the notion of ‘social justice’ is of Christian (Roman Catholic) origin, best formulated by their Pope in the twentieth century. Without a Christian framework within which to understand and endorse it, the entire ‘social justice’ idea dissolves into incoherence. Leo Shields, commissioned as a Lieutenant in the US army and dies fighting in France in 1945, received a doctorate from the University of Notre Dame in 1941 for his dissertation on “&lt;em&gt;The History and Meaning of the Term Social Justice&lt;/em&gt;”. There, he summarises it as follows:&#xA;“The … message of social justice is written in sharp relief against…(the) background of individualist thought in all its forms — romantic, rationalistic, humanitarian, totalitarian. It is the key to the reintegration of social life that must be inspired by Christian faith and charity and supported by grace. But it is a key which even this pagan society can turn if it is shown how. The realization of the idea of social justice is the unity of social peace.”&#xA;(I have written on this issue: see the article “Caste-based reservation and ‘social justice’ in India”. It is published in the book &lt;em&gt;Western Foundations of the Caste System&lt;/em&gt;, 2017, and is also available on my &lt;em&gt;academia.edu&lt;/em&gt; page.)&#xA;The current ruling party bends over backwards to appease ‘oppressed’ groups because it has bought into the image sold by others that it is a ‘religious fundamentalist party’ or that it is a ‘majoritarian party’ and that it would be against ‘social justice’ to do otherwise, etc. I do not think that the BJP (and the Sangh Parivar) are religious fundamentalists. This way of characterising and demonising them is the favorite pastime of the intellectually weak. But the BJP buys into its hook, line and sinker and is constantly busy ‘defending’ itself from these pseudo-attacks.&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;21: Islam has 200 million adherents in India, and Christianity is expanding fast through conversions in many states. There are non-Hindu majorities in seven states/Union Territories, and even states like Kerala may soon have fewer than 50 per cent who call themselves Hindu (it is 54 per cent now, but in 20 years, it could fall below 50 per cent). How do we apply your theories and postulates to defend the ideas that are truly Indian, especially when radical Islam and Evangelical Christianity are seeking to differentiate and dissociate from Indian cultural ethos, aided by global social justice warriors?&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;I have spoken about how religion spreads in two ways: secularisation and proselytisation. Secularisation is more dangerous of the two. Strangely, Indians are more worried about proselytisation than they are about secularisation, which spreads Christian ideas in a de-Christianised form. Indian culture was not threatened by these religions, and it was able to deal with their proselytising drive. It did so without persecuting them or banning them. A vibrant Indian culture can handle religion in such a way that religion itself changes to adapt itself into the non-religious environment it finds itself in.&#xA;But the impact of colonialism, the enduring colonial consciousness and secularisation of religious ideas have consistently reduced the vibrancy of our culture. Post-Independence has seen an acceleration of this loss-of-vibrancy. The process of secularisation transforms ‘the other’, in our case the Indian traditions, into pale and erring variants of religion. We Indians swallow this silly idea hook, line, and sinker. One of the reasons why Indian culture is losing its vibrancy is because we are busy transforming it into something it is not. We are unable to transmit the culture we received from our ancestors to posterity because we have taken over the language and framework of the West (from Indology and other social sciences).&#xA;It is not a question of practical problems like how to argue in a court of law, but a question of how you look at yourself, your life, and your experiences. What is breathtaking is the combination of ignorance and complacency of Indians. We don’t understand English, but we are certain that we are experts there. We very easily pick up words and sentences and use them without any reflection or self-reflection and even write on our ‘experiments with truth’. We don’t ask if those words make sense of our experience. This did not create huge problems to the generation that grew up in the 1950s because they were schooled in regional languages and used English in addition to it. But that is no longer the case; it has progressively become worse with every generation. Thus, we have today’s generation which only learns English (that too badly) and as a result cannot speak, think, or write coherently in any language. Not in English and not in any regional language.&#xA;Regional languages have provided protection against colonial consciousness. I often tell my Indian students to think in their native languages, as though they are speaking to their grandmothers. The result is striking: the amount of nonsense that comes out of their mouths gets reduced drastically. It is much harder to speak in slogans, jargon and produce verbiage if you must explain it in Kannada or Marathi to your grandmother. Then you are forced to interrogate what you are saying. You are forced to think. (You cannot explain to your grandmother what ‘coloniality’ or ‘decoloniality’ is even if someone has coined a regional language word to translate these words.) But unfortunately, regional languages are on the decline. The millennials were already severely handicapped and now their children will be even more stunted: incoherent, confused, and unhappy personalities who speak broken English with pseudo-American accents.&#xA;We can improve this sorry situation by promoting regional languages in India. One way to do it would be to combine the strengths of the twentieth century with the strengths of our culture (its &lt;em&gt;orality&lt;/em&gt;) by creating and promoting audio books of some of the great literature written in Indian regional languages.&#xA;Because the millennial and post-millennial generations cannot read or write in regional languages, they have a very limited access to language and culture. The scope of their language is limited to conversations with friends and TV series. Without access to the richness of ideas through language, they have no way of evolving. So, they lose access to one of the most important resources of a culture: its literature, art, and ideas. And without these resources, they cannot aspire to become anything more than two-dimensional uncultured boors. Therefore, by making the literature in regional languages available as audio books, we can partially restore their access to regional languages and thus to Indian culture and ideas.&#xA;What I hope will happen in India is that a generation will come which can look at the ravages wrought by colonialism and the post-independence institutions and start dismantling the useless and dangerous structures and start building anew. They will have to be intellectuals and builders, formed and shaped by the consequences of the current generation’s failures. Perhaps the grandchildren of the millennials. They will need intellectual tools and frameworks. It is for that posterity that I write.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/colonial-consciousness-and-servitude/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;[ Published on &lt;a href=&#34;https://swarajyamag.com/politics/prime-ministers-panch-pran-and-decoloniality-indian-servility-may-have-roots-in-secularised-islam&#34;&gt;swarjyamag&lt;/a&gt; Aug 26, 2022]&#xA;Let me recollect the question we agreed upon: &lt;em&gt;how does the combined phrase (colonial mindset and servitude) make sense within the framework of my research programme?&lt;/em&gt;&#xA;My hypothesis on religion includes characterizing the dynamics of its expansion. As I see it, such a dynamic includes (a) conversion and (b) secularization. The first side of the dynamic, ‘conversion’, is well-known to most of us: here, some or another religion &lt;em&gt;inducts&lt;/em&gt; ‘non-believers’ into its fold or into its community of believers and practitioners. (I also called it ‘proselytization’, a term that notices how Judaism and Christianity use ‘proselyte’.) The second side of the dynamic, ‘secularization’, is known to us only very partially.&#xA;Made popular since the Enlightenment period in Europe, this partial description identifies an &lt;em&gt;antithetical movement&lt;/em&gt; where an individual religion begins to lose its earlier influence on its spheres of influence: the civil organizations and the civil authorities. This classical story is about the withdrawal of religion from various domains in society: politics, law, judiciary, and so on. In this ‘age of reason’, it is suggested that human reason begins to govern these institutions and provide their foundations instead of religious opinions and dogmas. One of its consequences is the loss of the power and control of the Church on the State. Called ‘secularism’, this process indicates the waning power of religion on people and their imaginations especially by freeing the civil, the social, and the psychological spheres of human beings and society. The freedom from those shackles that enslaved them over the millennia made human beings and their societies grow and expand. ‘Indian Secularism’ (both as a vacuous doctrine and in the threadbare ‘foundation’ it received in the Indian constitution) expresses this faith and this conviction in an extremely pathetic form ever since (or even decades before) the Indian independence 75 years ago.&#xA;My story, while giving credence to the hostility it expresses, locates the ‘secularization process’ as another side in the expansion of religion. Secularization is antithetical to the expansion of &lt;em&gt;some or another&lt;/em&gt; religion, but it expands religion itself as a phenomenon in a culture or society. As we know, each religion (I have the Semitic religions in mind here) is always &lt;em&gt;a specific religion:&lt;/em&gt; it emerged at some time, in a specific region, among a specific people, in a specific language, embodying specific doctrines, and specific practices. Thus, every religion (even where it aspires to be &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; religion for the entire humankind) is always a specific religion. These very specificities that lend identity to some or another religion act as constraints on &lt;em&gt;religion&lt;/em&gt;, which is, as I characterize it, the explanatory intelligible account of the Cosmos and itself. This account is &lt;em&gt;the truth&lt;/em&gt; about all that was, is and shall be. This truth is not only in the world but religion, as such an account, exhibits that truth. Thus, religion, &lt;em&gt;as religion&lt;/em&gt;, expands itself while this or that specific religion expands through conversion. Both, taken together, are moments in the expansion of religion.&#xA;Even though secularization of religion is a general process, how this process occurs is determined by the conditions of emergence of a specific religion and how that religion converts. That is, how religion secularizes itself is subject to the nature and constraints that the specific religions face. Thus, the secularization of Judaism, Christianity and Islam occur &lt;em&gt;differently&lt;/em&gt; even where each of them undergoes secularization as a moment in its expansion. In each of these religions, secularization is inimical and hostile to a particular religion because of the specificities that give us an individual religion.&#xA;In ‘What does it mean to be an Indian?’ I said that Indians were children of two colonialisms: one colonizer was Islam and the other was the British. This means that &lt;em&gt;religions too colonize&lt;/em&gt;. I did not expand on the idea in that book (you must wait for the upcoming works to grasp the idea more fully), but I will briefly outline only one element of this colonizing event. It is true that Islam tried to convert Indians and it is also true that it did so violently. While Islam launched many waves of destructive attacks on Indian traditions, their temples, and practices, etc., we were not colonized by this aspect or phase of Islamic expansion. (It is in the nature of religions, Christianity and Islam, to convert through extremely violent means when conversion is directed towards larger populations and established cultures. Judaism, after around 5th century C.E., almost stopped conversion. There are various reasons for this cessation, none of which is relevant for my story here.) &lt;em&gt;We were colonized by secularized Islam&lt;/em&gt;. That is, conversion into Islam did not colonize us; the secularized Islam did.&#xA;I have already noted that secularization is inimical and hostile to religion. What does it mean in our case? It means that the secularized Islam that colonized us was hostile to &lt;em&gt;Islam as a religion&lt;/em&gt;. Among other things, it means that it is &lt;em&gt;hostile&lt;/em&gt; to Islamic doctrines as well. How? In very simple religious terms: &lt;em&gt;secularized Islam is blasphemy&lt;/em&gt; (within the framework of Islam as a religion). What does this mean?&#xA;According to Islam, Allah is the Lord and the Ruler of the Universe. As the word ‘Islam’ indicates, it demands an attitude of absolute submission and total surrender to Allah and His will. It requires a complete obedience to Him; human beings must follow His rules and Laws unconditionally. In its phase of conversion into a religion, Islam tried to inculcate this reverential attitude and habit towards Allah among the converted. In its secularizing moment, Secularized Islam reversed this thought and attitude entirely and gave it &lt;em&gt;a blasphemous form&lt;/em&gt;: among Indians, it inculcated and induced such a habit and attitude, &lt;em&gt;not towards Allah&lt;/em&gt;, but towards human rulers. &lt;em&gt;Secularized Islam put human Muslim rulers of India above the Prophet Mohammed and placed the same rulers as Allah’s equals&lt;/em&gt;. This is how secularized Islam expressed its antithetical attitude to Islam as a religion and expressed its hostility towards Islam.&#xA;I have claimed that colonialism transforms the experience of people and prevents the colonial subjects from accessing it in any form other than how the colonizer defines it. This inability to access our experience is what I call ‘colonial consciousness’. This is what secularized Islam also did: it introduced slavishness and servitude into Indian psychology. Centuries of this colonization made a &lt;em&gt;slavish submission to civil authorities&lt;/em&gt; the hallmark and an important trait of Indian cultural psychology. In very simple terms: &lt;em&gt;Indians became slavish, submissive, and servile to civil (i.e., human) authorities&lt;/em&gt;.&#xA;The British noticed this psychological trait of Indians and said that Indians were ‘effeminate’ and had ‘no backbone’. Though this is what all the Bengalis were in their eyes, after all, Bengal was one of first important ports of call to the British; very soon, all Indians joined the group of a servile people. That is why they went in search of ‘military’ castes in their attempts to recruit Indians to the British army. They found such ‘castes’ among the Sikhs and the Marathas (both of whom fought the Muslim rulers over long periods) and the Gurkhas (who were least subject to secularized Islamic rule). They found it among some ‘sub-castes’ as well: the Coorgis in Karnataka belonged to the ‘martial type’. The rest of India was too effeminate to be of much use except to slavishly obey the British authorities and lick their boots. How Indian child-rearing practices and the socialization processes in India succumbed to cultivating servility in Indian children because of Islamic colonization has not been understood yet. But that is not relevant to this story now.&#xA;When British ‘gave’ India her independence, the Indian servility did not disappear. It continues to be produced and reproduced even today. If we look at how Indians relate to &lt;em&gt;civil authorities&lt;/em&gt;, we see this servitude everywhere. The bureaucracy, the police, the ministers receive obsequiousness without demanding it. They punish those who dare ‘defy’ them. This is not merely how ordinary Indians relate to political and administrative authorities: this is institutionalized within these organizations too. How a peon responds to the boss; how a junior secretary bows down to the Deputy secretary; how the Chief secretary deals with Principal secretaries; how the chief minister treats the principal and the chief secretaries, how the circle inspector treats the local constable and is treated in turn by the assistant commissioner of police… This servitude, often called sycophancy, goes all the way to the very top.&#xA;This is how Indians are seen abroad: whether by the Chinese or in the West. Obsequious, eager to please and servile. This cultural psychology expresses our colonial consciousness as induced by Islamic colonization. Very recently, a few weeks ago, I read somewhere that Rahul Gandhi fulminated against the Indian foreign service officials thus: Indian diplomats are seen to have become &lt;em&gt;arrogant&lt;/em&gt; by others elsewhere in the world (due to Modi’s government). This perception makes sense: Indian diplomats are not any more as servile as they were in the last sixty years. They continue to have this psychology, but they do not express it as ‘the normal’ anymore.&#xA;There is much, much more to say than what I have. The story is bigger, broader, and richer than what I have penned so far. But I will round-off here. The phrase that combines ‘colonial mindset’ and ‘servitude’ makes sense within my research programme this way. It tells me how one colonialism has generated one aspect of our psychology. This attitude and orientation are in us and with us even now and will have their own poisonous and deleterious impacts on the development of the amritkaal that the PM spoke about. As I told you in an earlier mail, I have no clue what the PM intended or meant. This post is merely an attempt to see whether the combination makes sense within my research programme. It does. However, the implications are &lt;em&gt;gigantic&lt;/em&gt;: both for pursuing the pledge (the pran) and to fulfill it in the amritkaal that the PM seeks. They have their own pernicious effects on the current programmes of the government and all its future policies.&#xA;I must apologize for the brevity. You must wait for the upcoming works to understand this story properly. But I do hope this post will have done enough to keep the promise that I made in my earlier post.&#xA;Clarifications:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Experience and truth</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Of course, you can use Kant (or anyone other philosopher of your liking) to talk about what experience is. But if you use these thinkers (of the last 1000 years or so) to think about experience, you will be trapped in a set of problems: (a) you will have to talk about sensory input (no matter what technical term you use here), which cognition works on; (b) the world as something that provides these inputs; (c) distinguishing subjectivity and objectivity of the perception of the world accordingly and so on. Ultimately, truth becomes the final arbiter of everything.&#xA;In contrast stands Indian thinking that talks about ‘forms’ (Rupa, Rasa, Sparsha, Sabda, Gandha etc) that interact with our abilities (that includes cognition as a part) and about how this world of forms interacts with us. This leads to our notion(s) of experience. In this case, we do not talk about indoctrination but about learning and changing the processes of learning.&#xA;I have decided to take the second route because it helps me find solutions to problems. The first route blocks even the noticing that there are problems.&#xA;Of course, I have not yet written out even the outlines of the second route, whereas the first has many champions over the last 500 years. To outline the second route absorbing what cognitive sciences and multiple psychologies (not to speak of biology) tell us about ourselves is a huge undertaking, which I cannot possibly complete before I die.

      <title>How to understand corruption?</title>
      <link>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/how-to-understand-corruption/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 30 Sep 2022 09:21:28 +0530</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/how-to-understand-corruption/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Let us take the word ‘duty’ for the moment. Conflict in duties does not give you a moral dilemma. For a moral dilemma to occur two necessary conditions must exist: the prescribed set of duties must be logically consistent by virtue of which one is obliged to perform them all.  A dilemma pertains to a situation where one has an obligation to do A and an obligation to do B; but can in fact do only one. It is the perfect consistency of the system of duty that gives rise to the dilemma: a choice between A and B, between a banana and an orange is not a dilemma. It becomes a dilemma when you want both and can have only one. So, a moral dilemma cannot possibly describe a conflict of duties if one uses the word ‘duty’ here.  A conflict of &lt;em&gt;dharmas&lt;/em&gt; is not a dilemma at all.&#xA;What I mean by decolonizing social Sciences is very simple thing. There are many domains today: sociology, political science, psychology, and anthropology that call themselves social sciences as distinct from humanities. So, I am not talking about decolonizing science in the specific sense given by Mohini Mullick. I do not consider the theories in these domains which call themselves social sciences to be science at all. Today, I see all of them without exception as ideologies. I call my project ‘Comparative Science of Culture’ because existing theories are not social sciences.&#xA;For instance: political corruption refers to the act of an individual public servant who is part of a state or a government and who acts against the public interest of the people or the interest of the state. Because state has an interest which coincides with the interest of the society, then any action that supports an individual’s interest is morally wrong. This is the meaning of political corruption.&#xA;I am very conservative. I want a scientific hypothesis in the sense that it solves a problem, has an explanatory potential and there is some way to test it. In this sense, political theory is completely bankrupt. I proffer two hypotheses which at least minimally do what you expect a hypothesis to do.&#xA;The first is purely historical in nature. You raised a question about the moral evaluations which comes from a completely Western ethics and is not Indian at all. We in India had our own forms of social organization. We had certain indigenous ways of governing, of organizing production. But with colonization came industrialization, bringing with it management institutions from the West; structures were imposed on native Indian industries, on native structures, which today are taught in MBA courses all over India. The result is institutional distortion, so that you come across extraordinary things that baffle management theorists.&#xA;More concretely: how were questions asked about tradition? Can we use the resources of our ancient Indian literature to tackle and explain this problem? I find the Indian tradition powerful because it can help generate scientific hypotheses beyond the reach of Western social scientists. That’s why I am against the latter, not because they are Western. I am not against everything Western: Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, Biology come from the Western tradition.&#xA;(pp 206-8 &amp;ldquo;Classical Indian Thought and the English Language&amp;rdquo; edited by Mullick, et al.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Descriptions about the world vs. Manuals for action</title>
      <link>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/descriptions-vs-manuals/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 28 Sep 2022 19:59:21 +0530</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/descriptions-vs-manuals/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is broadly accepted that one of the most important functions of language is to describe the world outside it. Could it be the case that when it comes to the Indian systems, they all (whether it is Advaita vedanta, Yoga vasistha, visista advaita) are teaching one to act, to live in a particular way? In other words, they are not saying what there is in the world but are manuals in a manner of speaking. Of course, in order to understand a manual you need reference points in the world. So when they say for example that when the Buddha argued for &lt;em&gt;anatman&lt;/em&gt; or Sankara spoke about &lt;em&gt;atman&lt;/em&gt;, one way of interpreting, which is what most Indian philosophers have done, is that they attribute doctrines to them and say this is a description of the world. But actually they were not describing the world. Buddha does not say atman exists or does not exist or whatever. Sankara is not saying &lt;em&gt;atman&lt;/em&gt; exists because that would be a description of our world. So what a guru does in our tradition, which is what the upadesa is, is to teach one to not look at these as descriptions of the world; he teaches one how to transform them into a way of living. So Yoga vasistha does not tell you what the world is like. That can be said in one sentence. Why then does this man have to write so much? It is to help you go on in a certain way and then say that this is not a description of the world.&#xA;(p. 308 &amp;ldquo;Classical Indian Thought and the English Language&amp;rdquo; edited by Mullick, et al.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Truth, belief, intentionality, eudaimonia, ought</title>
      <link>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/truth-belief-intentionality-eudaimonia-ought/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I want to respond to three of your points Claus. First you are not talking only about the Greeks and the Romans because all the problems arising with respect to the phenomena of non-Western societies and culture are/were equally the problems in the frameworks of different varieties of culture. You not only talk about the Greeks and the Romans, you gave examples about the French and the English as well.&#xA;The second point is: you talk about the fact that people face the same problem in Europe of today when they talk about the Greeks and the Romans. You are absolutely right. But that confirms my point, namely, that the Greeks and the Romans had no religion. They were Pagan cultures and this is exactly the problem with India. The Christian culture doesn’t understand Greek — the whole of Heidegger’s philosophy is an example of that. He says we cannot think Greek. And his whole attempt to speak about what thinking is, what truth is, etc. — is an attempt to rescue the Greek language from what he called the Christianization of Latin. I am aware that contemporary European languages and modern Europe do have problems with the Greeks and Romans. But just because of the fact that Ancient Greece and Rome are located in the Western hemisphere does not make them part of Western culture. In an earlier publication, I showed that neither Greece nor Rome were cradles of Western civilization. Western Civilization is Christian Civilization, although you might not agree with that. Greece and Rome do not belong to it. That is why we Indians can understand them. Let me give you a small example — One of the most fundamental notions of Aristotle is &lt;em&gt;eudaimonia&lt;/em&gt;, which gets translated with great difficulty as ‘well-being’, ‘feeling good’, ‘happiness’ and so on. It is a very difficult word to translate. This is not merely a translation problem because I have had discussions with Greek scholars. Aristotle asks: what is &lt;em&gt;eudaimonia&lt;/em&gt;? It is very difficult to achieve of course but he says once you have it you cannot lose it. I told a Greek Specialist once ‘you know nothing about Greek language’, He responded: ‘how dare you say that’! So, I said: ‘here is a simple thing, forget the translation of &lt;em&gt;eudaimoni&lt;/em&gt;a, give me one example of a human  property which once you possess, you do not lose.’ I said: ‘I do not have to understand Greek to understand what &lt;em&gt;eudaimonia&lt;/em&gt; means.’ And of course to this day, no Greek scholar could help me in giving one example of one human property which if once you possess you do not lose&amp;ndash;this is a fundamental property of &lt;em&gt;eudaimonia&lt;/em&gt;. For the Indians here is my answer. &lt;em&gt;Eudaimonia&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;em&gt;aananda.&lt;/em&gt; Once you have &lt;em&gt;aananda&lt;/em&gt; you do not lose it. It is equivalent in some conditions to &lt;em&gt;brahma-gyaana.&lt;/em&gt; And that is happiness indeed, beyond &lt;em&gt;sukha&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;duhkha&lt;/em&gt;. So when Aristotle is talking about &lt;em&gt;eudaimonia&lt;/em&gt; I understand him and I read him carefully. Of course, there is no translation equivalent of eudaimonia in any of the European languages but that is because they have no access to that world, that conceptual framework like we Indians have. So indeed, I understand you have a problem with Greece and Rome: we understand them much better.&#xA;Two other points &amp;ndash; one on Galileo. I am not conflating the community of Christians with a community of non-Christians because one of the claims I have substantiated to which in the last fifteen years I have found no counter argument, is the following: My claim is that free thinkers and atheists, even the Communists of Europe, are actually disguised theists. That is to say that Christianity has secularized itself in political theory, in social theory, in rational choice theory; a number of theories. I can show you how assumptions from the Bible have taken secular forms. So by saying for instance, ‘look I don’t have a religious background’, it makes no difference. I know people, who do not have a religious background for generations, are atheists but they continue to have the same excuse for speaking as Christians do. For example, your ethics will be absolutely no different from Christian ethics because there is no such thing as non-Christian secular ethics present today. ‘You ought not to kill’. Don’t tell me that is an example of secular ethics. Even the notion of ‘ought not’, the normative notion itself, does not come from English: it comes from Christianity, from the Bible.&#xA;Aristotle, for example, does not have an ‘ought’. Indian languages do not have a ‘moral ought’ nor do the Chinese in their language in which Confucius wrote. These are not linguistic issues, Claus, these are problems of conceptual apparatuses that are culturally developed. So, it is in that sense that I speak about Galileo and say he made sense to the Europeans. They used his findings to investigate nature because they believed fundamentally that nature has a structure and pattern and a law which has to be discovered by human investigation. They would say that without such a structure the universe should be chaos. The whole of 2,000 years of European culture believes that, and that was Galileo’s idea as well. It is a background belief, of course, but it is a background belief of that culture and we are talking about difference between cultures. Translation is always a translation between people who use sentences, who use natural languages. So, I am shifting the level of the problem.&#xA;Last point, there is something to be said for your claim regarding the notion of belief&amp;ndash;that you can have a concept, but do not have a word&amp;ndash;that is absolutely true. That is our daily experience. I feel like saying something but I don’t know how to say it. So, you can have some sense of a concept but defined psychologically not linguistically or so cognitively. I do not know how to put it in a natural sentence. Right. But you are making out of it logical and philosophical points.&#xA;Let me put it very sharply. The notion of having a belief and the belief is always about something; this is a specific conception of man, of human beings&amp;ndash;there is philosophical anthropology which attributes some notion of intention to human beings. One of the extraordinary things about the Indian tradition is the absence of this notion of intentionality:  &lt;em&gt;agyana&lt;/em&gt;. They call it &lt;em&gt;maaya&lt;/em&gt; and many different things. So the nature of human being in the Indian tradition is that we are non-intentional creatures, which is completely incomprehensible within the framework of Christian culture. So, entertaining having a belief is not a linguistic, psychological, epistemological fact which is applicable to all human beings but is a specific assumption about the nature of human beings that comes from the Bible. So when saying that Indians have beliefs, you are not making use of any understanding of language – you are making use of a religious concept/understanding of man and saying that is what Indians have. Of course, you can say that; people have been saying that for 500 years. That is not the issue.&#xA;The issue is: is this how Indians understand themselves? In fact, if you look at the languages you find there is greater affinity when you talk of using work-words. They do not say ‘I got angry’ but ‘anger came upon me’ &amp;ndash; this is a very typical old classical Greek way of talking. ‘Why did you say that?’ ‘I do not know, my tongue moved that way’. I am literally translating local Indian languages into English&amp;ndash;this is the way we talk. In fact, even the subject notion, is not simply a linguistic subject or verb subject in action, the fundamental ontological notion of subject itself is missing in India as also the notion of agency.&#xA;Take the problem about truth: the notion of truth for applying to sentences, to propositions by some other philosophers is a very philosophical disease. If you look at the middle-ages, take Aquinas for example, he had two notions of truth: &lt;em&gt;adeequatio re&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;adequatio intellectus&lt;/em&gt;. One is which is adequate to the object; the other which is adequate to thoughts. Hegel used the same notion. Tarski also says there are multiple notions of truth. That notion of truth — &lt;em&gt;adaquatio intellectus&lt;/em&gt; as it prevailed for 1,900 years in Western culture referred to the fact that objects are adequate to how God conceives them. That is &lt;em&gt;adequatio intellectus&lt;/em&gt;&amp;ndash;adequate not to human intellects, to God’s intellect. &lt;em&gt;Adequatio re&lt;/em&gt; had to do with how one related the word to both these notions and emerged, &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; from any understanding of language, truth, philosophy, or logic, it arose from commenting on theologies and commenting the Bible.  (pp 162-166 &amp;ldquo;Classical Indian Thought and the English Language&amp;rdquo; edited by Mullick, et al.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Narratives vs Theories</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The question requires deeper handling so you will forgive me for the brevity of my response but you will get some idea of where I stand.&#xA;Regarding the first question as to whether we reject social science itself, I am aware that many people have made this suggestion. I am not so much hung up on the word &amp;lsquo;social science&amp;rsquo; but I do believe that we need to systematically reflect on our experiences in the world. A systematic reflection on experiences in the form of a theory is what we can conveniently call social science. We need theories about the world to understand the World. Systematic thinking means use of certain criteria to decide which theories are good or not, etc. and which to choose. The best thing would be to appeal to the history of the natural sciences over say four hundred years to see how they have done it, what kind of criteria they used. Thus, I belong to the group which advocates systematic reflection on experience, and in that sense, I belong to the group which says we need social science.&#xA;Your second question was about Indians having different ways of understanding experience: you spoke of narratives and the autobiography of Tulsi Ram. This raises the question of what form these reflections are going to take. To give a crude example: are they going to be mathematized? Will they take the form of scientific laws or of narratives? That is a very interesting question. But all narratives are not social science: in that case every novelist would have a scientific theory. If a text is an autobiography, it is not social science.&#xA;pp 103-4 of &amp;ldquo;Classical Indian Thought and the English Language&amp;rdquo; edited by Mullick, et al.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am going to ask for a clarification on a question which I find very troubling. Let me first read how you have formulated the problem from the text: Sanskrit scholars need modem social scientists. What disturbs me in anthropological fieldwork is that Sanskrit literature is made to play the role of native informer to social scientists, with the anthropologists asking themselves as they might with Maori culture: is there something valuable which has been lost?&#xA;Claus Oetke also makes the same point. Even if you say that the dialogue between the primitive and the anthropologist is sophisticated, native informers are not merely informants. This idea, this interaction pattern which has existed for the last forty years has a double bias&amp;ndash;that of the anthropologist and that of the native informant. They have very powerful dialogues but anthropologists fundamentally take a priori positions, assuming that Sanskritists are the only ones who hold the key: they do not really believe that non-Sanskritists could possibly have anything to contribute.&#xA;But it would be absurd to dismiss Indian culture a priori without an investigation into India&amp;rsquo;s intellectual contributions without entertaining the possibility that Indian culture and tradition might today in a very significant sense be a challenge to the Western traditions which form our intellectual background. Your question shuts it out because it comes from Sanskrit. In your story of the fieldwork model, all Indian parameters answer the sophisticated social scientists model. I am surprised because you have another strand which goes in the opposite direction. But the fundamental framework you are using suggests maximally that we might learn something like Sanskrit aesthetics, rasa theory, etc. or even something like curry. This kind of trivialization has resulted from colonialism: it has been and is, very suppressive.&#xA;pp 42-43 of &amp;ldquo;Classical Indian Thought and the English Language&amp;rdquo; edited by Mullick, et al.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Solving vs dissolving problems</title>
      <link>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/solving-vs-dissolving-problems/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Aug 2022 17:05:23 +0530</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/solving-vs-dissolving-problems/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the examples you refer to, you touch on an approach to situations and problems that are Indian (in the sense of culture) contrasted to which stands another culture’s way of dealing with situations. The simplest way to explicate this difference in a general way, using your examples as a reference point, would be this: when we speak of problems and solutions, there are two ways of looking at them. In the first, an existing problem gets &lt;em&gt;resolved&lt;/em&gt;: both the problem and its solution continue to exist (both in memory and in records) in their forms of appearance. They have their independent existence even though they are conceptually (and chronologically) linked to each other. That is, a problem does not ‘disappear’ after its resolution; the solution retains its status (as a solution to a particular problem) as does the problem. This is how the West looks at problems and their resolution (mostly). This is also how we think scientifically. To put it in the form of a slogan, which has its own limitations: a situation is transformed into a theoretical problem.&#xA;In human situations (i.e., situations involving human conflicts and difficulties), the above approach is &lt;em&gt;damaging&lt;/em&gt;. In the Indian way, which is geared and focused on human situations, the event (or the situation) is turned into a &lt;em&gt;practical problem&lt;/em&gt;. In such cases, the solutions &lt;em&gt;dissolve&lt;/em&gt; the problem. Neither the problem nor the solution has any existence thereafter because the &lt;em&gt;dissolution of the problem creates a new situation&lt;/em&gt;. The memory and the records of this act, which transformed one situation into another, will exist but in their status as &lt;em&gt;changed states&lt;/em&gt;: a memory or a record of how a state-change occurred because of a set of actions.&#xA;When the first way is used to deal with human problems, psychologically speaking, a trauma is ‘left behind’. In the second case, what you undergo in the world gets structured as an experience and this is what a human being accumulates over the course of its life. In a very general sense, again in the form of a slogan, a situation is made into a practical problem.&#xA;It appears to me that in situations of uncertainty and imperfect information, the second approach is better of the two. Even if a solution might not have been the best (speaking from hindsight), it enables a human being to continue to live as well as situations possibly allow. In the first approach, you continue to live as a crippled human being haunted by one or multiple traumas. (Because in ‘What does it mean to be an Indian?’ these ideas are treated in greater detail, I will not elaborate further on these here.) The general Indian approach to, say, rape, would then be contrasted with how Indian (and western) feminists speak of rape using a legal and a western language. Abortion would also be an illustration: the examples you give would then be contrasted with how the issue is ‘debated’ in the US.&#xA;Now, to the issue you raise. Is the Indian route moral and ethical? If you follow how the West has thought on morality and ethics (especially in the last 200 years or more), the answer is in the negative. This is how our intellectuals and semi-intellectuals &lt;em&gt;talk&lt;/em&gt;: with the greatest possible ignorance about what the West says and about what ethics is, they reproduce their words. Moral/immoral, just/unjust, ethical/unethical, and so on. Even though most would not be able to explain what a moral obligation is or what a moral forbiddance is, they hold forth a moralizing discourse defending atrocious policies, laws, and attitudes. Those who follow the Indian way are intellectually incapable of saying or thinking coherently about their ethics: they spout what they ‘think’ Shastras say and what, according to whatever takes their fancy at the moment, dharma and adharma are. In short: all the moral talk and ethical theories in the West has only produced the most immoral civilization that humankind has the misfortune to live under. A truly humane and reasonable approach to the human predicament has generated the biggest bunch of morons that the world has ever produced in recent times, who parade their utter ignorance as knowledge.&#xA;When you formulate the above issue as a question, “pregnancy and abortion are very practical affairs - emotional yes, but not moral or ethical. Is this a right way to think about it?” the answer cannot be unambiguous. Yes, it is a moral and ethical issue &lt;em&gt;because it is a practical issue&lt;/em&gt;. Ethics and morality are practical issues par excellence: but one who talks about it (the West) has made this issue theoretical whereas the other (India) who acts in a practical way does not know how to talk about it. One is bloated with an insufferable pretention and the other is bloated with absolute ignorance. But both ply their trade on the market fighting for customers.&#xA;In simple terms: we must try to think and articulate how human issues are practical and ethical and thus live without traumas dominating our lives. A task for the millennials and the Z-generation, I suppose.&#xA;For more, read &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/who-needs-a-world-view/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Who needs a world view&amp;rdquo; (&lt;/a&gt;esp 3.5 &amp;amp; 6.3)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sacred determines what profane is; it is not about respect for religion.&#xA;The film &lt;em&gt;Innocence of Muslims&lt;/em&gt;  has turned cities around the world upside down in the past week, and threatens to continue to do so. “We never insult other prophets”, says the tenor of several Muslims, “so why can’t we demand that Mohammed receive respect? We respect others; why do they insult us?&amp;quot; Others argued that the anger stems from a demand for “freedom”: the right of a community to be free from serious insults against its identity and values.&#xA;As with the Mohammed cartoons from a few years ago, the same cliché appears in the debates: there must be more respect for the other. Everyone also believes that he has that respect for the other. But despite all that self-proclaimed respect, the world has not become more peaceful. What is going on then?&#xA;For Muslims, it is the religious issue of ridiculing the prophet. But for whom is Mohammed a prophet? Only for those who believe in Islam. That point applies to all religious symbols. Something is always a symbol for a certain person; what is a symbol for one is not for the other. Take a heathen like me: for me, neither the cross nor the prophet Mohammed symbolizes anything. The former is one thing and the latter is a human. The Sikhs in India may consider the turban as their religious symbol, but that is neither the case for me nor for a Protestant.&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;Requirement to repent&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;Something is only a religious symbol within the confines of a particular religion. Outside, it no longer has the same symbolic value. What then does it mean to demand that non-Muslims respect Mohammed? Is it a requirement to recognize him as a religious symbol or as a prophet? In that case, it comes down to a requirement to convert to Islam. Without that step, Mohammed can never become a religious symbol or a prophet to me and any other non-Muslim. What then is the significance of the complaint that the film &amp;ldquo;pokes fun at the prophet&amp;rdquo; and that one should not do that?&#xA;Muslims argue that depicting the prophet Mohammed is profane, because the prophet has forbidden depictions of himself and Allah. The answer is simple: the prophet&amp;rsquo;s words are only valid for those who accept him as a prophet. This rule has no power for non-Muslims.&#xA;But the question is: are we doing something immoral by not “respecting” their sense of profane? To answer that, we need to expand our perspective. To this day, some Protestants openly criticize Catholics by calling the Pope “the Antichrist”, portraying the Catholic Church as “the devil&amp;rsquo;s church”, and condemning Catholics as “devil worshipers”. Europe had decades of wars over it. To this day those central theses of Protestantism remain profane to the Catholics, just as the existence of Catholicism itself remains profane to many Protestants. What should we do if it is said that one group should not do what the other considers profane?&#xA;As an Indian, I look with even more amazement at the demands of the protesting Muslims. For centuries it has been at the core of Islam to describe Indian traditions (Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism) as idolatry and false demonic religion. According to Islam, Hindus worship Satan and his companions: their elephant god Ganesha, the adulterous Krishna or the phallic Shiva. That image is still current. Are such statements about the gods of India not offensive? Can one then demand that Muslims deny their basic doctrines on idolatry, God and Satan? If Islam did that, it would end its own existence as a religion. In other words, from a pagan perspective, the existence of a religion such as Islam (or Christianity) is itself “sacrilege.” The core of these religions transforms millions of people in Asia into idol worshipers and worshipers of the devil.&#xA;Muslims must be consistent: if they don&amp;rsquo;t want people to blaspheme their religion, they shouldn&amp;rsquo;t do it themselves to other religions and traditions.&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;Superior to all&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;In fact, if they are not willing to accept this conclusion, then the protesting Muslims’ claim comes down to this: the world must treat them as an exceptional religious community, equal to none and superior to all. Of course they believe that is the case. That is precisely why that belief is unacceptable to the rest of the world. The whole debate is not about “respect for other religions,” or “freedom of speech.” It is about a religious group, which considers itself superior to everyone else, demanding that all the world endorse the truth of this belief. Who is willing to do that? Not me in any case.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>agyana: existence or absence</title>
      <link>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/agyana-existence-or-absence/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 26 Jul 2022 11:39:15 +0530</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/agyana-existence-or-absence/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#xA;I face some difficulties in giving a &amp;lsquo;yes&amp;rsquo; or &amp;rsquo;no&amp;rsquo; answer to your question because I am not sure how to understand &amp;lsquo;Samsara&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;Jnana&amp;rsquo; and its Sanskrit negation &amp;lsquo;Ajnana&amp;rsquo;, and &amp;lsquo;moksha&amp;rsquo;. It is equally unclear whether there are differences of import between being &amp;rsquo;the root&amp;rsquo; and being &amp;rsquo;the cause&amp;rsquo;, as far as the relation between &amp;lsquo;Ajnana&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;Samsara&amp;rsquo; are concerned. &amp;lsquo;Maaya&amp;rsquo; is another notion used in the Indian traditions, at times as a synonym for &amp;lsquo;ajnana&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;avidya&amp;rsquo;, at times as the &amp;lsquo;cause&amp;rsquo; of &amp;lsquo;Ajnana&amp;rsquo;.&#xA;To illustrate my difficulties, consider two ways of understanding, say, &amp;lsquo;Ajnana&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;Moksha&amp;rsquo;.&#xA;If &amp;lsquo;Ajnana&amp;rsquo; is ignorance (understood as absence of knowledge) then &amp;lsquo;Jnana&amp;rsquo; does NOT have its opposite nature. The reason is not far to seek: ignorance, because it is determined as the absence of knowledge, does not possess any qualities or properties. (Something has to exist before it can have any properties.) Therefore, &amp;lsquo;jnana&amp;rsquo; cannot possess a nature that is the opposite of &amp;lsquo;ajnana&amp;rsquo;. So, ipso facto, we cannot claim that &amp;lsquo;jnana&amp;rsquo; is the only solution. If we insist on speaking about &amp;lsquo;opposite nature&amp;rsquo;,  consider the argument that anything that merely exists has &amp;rsquo;the opposite&amp;rsquo; property of &amp;lsquo;Ajnana&amp;rsquo; by the facticity of its existence. From this it follows that, if the only way to &amp;lsquo;break&amp;rsquo; ajana requires the presence of something that has its opposite &amp;rsquo;nature&amp;rsquo;, then any and every object that exists in the world can break &amp;lsquo;ajnana&amp;rsquo;.&#xA;Suppose that &amp;lsquo;Ajnana&amp;rsquo; is a positive force of some sort. To suggest that &amp;lsquo;only something that has an opposite force can break it&amp;rsquo; requires argument, evidence or some kind of proof. One could equally well suggest that &amp;lsquo;jnana&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;ajnana&amp;rsquo; meet other and neutralize one another; or that they both destroy each other; or that they combine to produce something that is entirely new; and so on. Each view has a plausible analogue in the world. Therefore, it depends on the plausibility of these analogies in order to accept that &amp;lsquo;jnana&amp;rsquo; is the only solution.&#xA;Consider now the notion of &amp;lsquo;moksha&amp;rsquo;. One could argue that this is attainable only at the end of a life of a person. If this position is accepted, then the claim that &amp;lsquo;jnana&amp;rsquo; leads to &amp;lsquo;moksha&amp;rsquo; has the same status as the claim that &amp;lsquo;Nishkama karma&amp;rsquo;, or &amp;lsquo;bhakti&amp;rsquo;, or &amp;lsquo;yoga&amp;rsquo; or &amp;rsquo;tapas&amp;rsquo;, or &amp;lsquo;puja&amp;rsquo; or whatever else leads to &amp;lsquo;moksha&amp;rsquo; as well. Therefore, one cannot defend the claim that &amp;lsquo;only jnana&amp;rsquo; leads to moksha.&#xA;Let us suppose that &amp;lsquo;moksha&amp;rsquo; can be attained during the course of a person&amp;rsquo;s life. In that case, &amp;lsquo;moksha&amp;rsquo; could be a state of mind, the way one lives, the manner in which one goes about with mundane things, an orientation, or a path one follows, and so on. If this is the case, then one cannot  claim that &amp;lsquo;jnana&amp;rsquo; is the only path that leads to &amp;lsquo;moksha&amp;rsquo;: there are multiple ways to arrive at a state of mind, come to a certain way of living, learn a manner of going about with mundane things, developing an orientation or even to tread a path. Even here, arguments are absent to suggest that &amp;lsquo;jnana&amp;rsquo; is the only path to &amp;lsquo;moksha&amp;rsquo;.&#xA;You see, the above is merely a hurried sample of the kind of difficulties we face, if we insist (today) on using Sanskrit words while conducting discussions about issues of great importance that the Indian traditions have been tackling over the millennia. Then we would simply (at the very best) reproduce old debates (of centuries ago) without solving any of the problems we confront. Hence my suggestion: let us leave the Sanskrit words aside; let us recreate the problem-situation of yesteryears in the languages and idioms of the twenty-first century. Let us see how many of these problems continue to make sense to us when we accept physics, chemistry, biology, logic, etc. that we know and take for granted. Of course, it is possible that some of these disputes will continue to exist even under such a reconstruction. But, if they do, they will enrich our lives instead of simply leading to semantic difficulties (at best) and linguistic squabbles (at worst) as is the case if you and I discuss in English using Sanskrit words.&#xA;II&#xA;You ask: &amp;ldquo;Ajnana is an absense with respect to a single entity *jnana* while shunya or void is an absense with respect to anything or everything. How can they be equated? How can, for example, your absense be the same as my absense?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Using knowledge as the translation of &amp;lsquo;Jnana&amp;rsquo;, what I say is this. Knowledge is always of something or another, i.e., it is about something specific in the world. Its negation, I use the notion of ignorance as a translation for &amp;lsquo;Ajnana&amp;rsquo;, suggests that there is no such knowledge. (In the context of this discussion, knowledge is about one&amp;rsquo;s true nature. It is an answer to the question &amp;lsquo;who am I?&amp;rsquo;) Many false statements can be given as an answer to this question, but there is NO correct answer to give, if one does not have the correct answer. That is to say, that person does not have (or possess) knowledge. In this sense, knowledge is non-existent as far as that person is concerned. If ignorance is used to characterize the absence of knowledge (or the absence of the true and correct answer), then this &amp;lsquo;absence&amp;rsquo; is like the empty set: knowledge simply does not exist (as far as that individual is concerned). All objects and entities that do not exist are on par: one cannot distinguish between non-existent objects because we distinguish objects from each other on the basis of some or another property. However, an object should exist for it to possess or have properties. As a consequence, there is only one empty set. (All possible but non-existent objects sit in this empty set, to put it a bit paradoxically. There are philosophically very interesting works written on non-existent objects; but I am not entering this terrain for the time being. There are also very thought-provoking philosophical writings on &amp;rsquo;negative facts&amp;rsquo;, i.e., &amp;lsquo;facts&amp;rsquo; that are not true. But I do not need them as yet for my research.)&#xA;Consider the city of Bremen in Germany today. Neither you nor I are present there; neither is Kannan, or Arun or Divya. In fact, all the human beings who ever lived on earth are absent from Bremen; for that matter, so are all the people who are not in Bremen today. How to make sense of the claim that the absence of these people have differential impacts on the city of Bremen? As far as I am concerned, I cannot. While our individual presence in the city of Bremen would have a differential impact on the city, the absence of all the people who are not in Bremen today has exactly the same impact: nothing. (Of course, some person in Bremen might have taken to excessive drinking because his/her loved one is absent from Bremen today. However, the impact is made by the person who is in the city and not by the one who is absent.) Our respective absences from some place or another might affect different people differently. But that does not mean that my absence and your absence are different KINDS of absences. We are absent. Period.&#xA;You further ask: &amp;ldquo;The biggest problem with considering Ajnana as a positive existence is the dictum - &amp;ldquo;That which exists can never cease to be&amp;rdquo;. If ignorance is some sort of existence, then how can it ever be got rid of? Existence can never cease to be but can be transformed. I don’t understand what transforming avidya could mean. I still dont understand why an absense cannot be a cause? I agree it cannot be a material cause but what about instrumental cause?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;In the first place, the notion of existence used in this dictum is technical in nature; it is a term of the art. Second, this dictum is &amp;rsquo;true&amp;rsquo; only by virtue of definition. Therefore, argument is not possible: it will be an interminable conflict between &amp;lsquo;my definition&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;your definition&amp;rsquo; without there being a way to settle the disputes.&#xA;What I am saying about &amp;lsquo;causes&amp;rsquo; is simply this. If something has to bring something else about, then it must exist in this world. In some senses, I am leaving everything vague, when I make this claim: I am not advancing any philosophical thesis about what it means &amp;rsquo;to bring about something&amp;rsquo;, what the &amp;lsquo;world&amp;rsquo; encompasses, and what &amp;rsquo;existence&amp;rsquo; is. I leave them vague because I would not like a philosophical thesis to lay down beforehand what any of these terms mean. I would like theories about the world to start explicating the meaning of these words. Until such time, I work with very loose suggestions that are intuitively communicable but not necessarily true by virtue of that. My intuitive idea tells me that objects, forces, powers, etc. need to be a part of this world (&amp;rsquo;exist&amp;rsquo;, in this intuitive sense), if they have to bring about some change (&amp;lsquo;cause&amp;rsquo;, in this intuitive sense) in the world. May be, the physicists will (one day) come up with a theory that this claim is not necessarily true for the Cosmos but holds only for certain domains. Even in such a case, I need a theory about how something that is non-existent can cause a change in the world, if one uses it to account for how ignorance prevents the emergence of knowledge (when ignorance is conceptualized as the absence of knowledge). Until such stage, I would like to work with the idea that if ignorance actively prevents the emergence of knowledge then that is because ignorance is a positive force of some sort and not merely the absence of knowledge.&#xA;I am not sure what you want to say with the distinction between &amp;lsquo;material&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;instrumental&amp;rsquo; cause in this context. As far as I am concerned, before something can be a cause (in the sense I just explained), no matter what kind of cause, it has to be a part of this world.&#xA;III&#xA;In some senses, we are wandering away from the question the thread raised: is it the case that there is only one path to the enlightenment, namely through knowledge (of the Upanishads)? More specifically, do the puranic stories simplify the insights of the Upanishads? My answer to it was in the negative.&#xA;The questions you raise in your last post, it appears to me, is an attempt by you to figure out from within the framework of some or another system of Indian thinking (let us, for the moment, call it Indian philosophy) what I am saying. I am not sure that such an attempt is going to be very productive. A better way would be to choose common problems and see what the respective answers are and find out which one of them is better suited for our purposes.&#xA;Despite the above reservation, here are my answers to your queries. I shall use a slightly different format for my answers this time.&#xA;You say: &amp;ldquo;But the point is this - who is making the statement &amp;ldquo;people are in ajnana&amp;rdquo;? it has to be a jnani. if everybody were ajnanis then there wouldn’t be a concept of ajnana. So only a jnani can make sense of ajnana.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The above claims are entirely context dependent. In some kinds of contexts, one can say that &amp;lsquo;people are ignorant&amp;rsquo;, include oneself in the category of &amp;lsquo;people&amp;rsquo;, without having knowledge. That is, one can speak about ignorance of &amp;lsquo;people&amp;rsquo; (including one&amp;rsquo;s own) without requiring that one has knowledge. For instance, in statements of the following sort, &amp;lsquo;we do not know much about how the brain works&amp;rsquo;; &amp;lsquo;we do not have an understanding of the mechanisms for the spread of cancer&amp;rsquo;; &amp;lsquo;we do not know whether elementary arithmetic is consistent&amp;rsquo; etc., we do speak of ignorance without it entailing that the speaker has knowledge. In other kinds of contexts, one can speak only of other&amp;rsquo;s ignorance even if one is more ignorant than the other: &amp;lsquo;he claims to be a physicist but does not know much about physics. Witness how he fell flat when I asked him to explain (this or that)&amp;quot;. In yet other kinds of contexts, one&amp;rsquo;s knowledge is the basis of characterizing other&amp;rsquo;s ignorance: &amp;ldquo;Even though he speaks Kannada fluently, he does not know its grammar. He could not parse words according to Kannada Sandhi rules.&amp;rdquo; And so on.&#xA;When you say that if everyone were to be ignorant, there would be no concept of ignorance. I am not sure how to interpret this sentence. There are many domains I am ignorant about, and I know I am ignorant about those domains. You seem to suggest that the logic of the word &amp;lsquo;Ajnana&amp;rsquo; entails that there can be no knowledge of one&amp;rsquo;s own ignorance (or about the limit of one&amp;rsquo;s own knowledge).  It could be the case that the notion of &amp;lsquo;Ajnana&amp;rsquo; has this logical and semantic property; I do not know. In that case, I would be very curious to discover why the theorem &amp;lsquo;p knows X entails that p knows that p knows X&amp;rsquo; would be invalid in Indian philosophies.&#xA;Or, it could be the case that you are suggesting something entirely different. &amp;lsquo;If I do not know the true nature of my &amp;lsquo;self&amp;rsquo; then it entails that I do not know that I do not know&amp;rsquo;. If this is the case, then it has more to do with the nature of the &amp;lsquo;I&amp;rsquo; (and the &amp;lsquo;self&amp;rsquo;) than with either knowledge or ignorance. Even here, there is a problem: how do we understand the quest for our &amp;rsquo;true&amp;rsquo; nature then? I can ask myself the question &amp;lsquo;who am I?&amp;rsquo; and go in search of answers precisely because I do not know the answer and know that I do not know (the answer).&#xA;You say further only the knowledgeable can make &amp;lsquo;sense&amp;rsquo; of ignorance. I lose you here. If ignorance is the absence of knowledge, what does it mean to make &amp;lsquo;sense&amp;rsquo; of ignorance? Absence of knowledge is neither &amp;lsquo;sensible&amp;rsquo; nor ‘nonsensical&amp;rsquo;. Ignorance itself is not a sentence (or a proposition) even if we use a sentence to speak about someone&amp;rsquo;s ignorance.&#xA;Your analogy is not a happy one. The relationship between boredom and the TV does not mirror the relationship between &amp;lsquo;Jnana&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;Ajnana&amp;rsquo;. The latter is the negation (in logical terms) of the former, which is not the case with respect to TV and boredom. You can draw a logical conclusion using an analogy and apply it another domain, if the (logical) relationship between the elements in the former mirrors the logical relationship between the elements in the latter.&#xA;You say, &amp;ldquo;To such a jnani, ajnana which is an absense of what he possesses (jnana) can very well be a cause.&amp;rdquo; I do not see what makes you suggest this. Note that the absence of knowledge about some X could also mean the presence of wrong ideas about that X. So, when the &amp;lsquo;Jnani&amp;rsquo; explains the &amp;lsquo;Ajnani&amp;rsquo; in terms of &amp;lsquo;Ajnana&amp;rsquo;, what he is doing is the following: he explains the &amp;lsquo;Ajnani&amp;rsquo; in terms of the wrong ideas s/he has but not by appealing to the &amp;lsquo;causal powers&amp;rsquo; of what is absent. That is, the &amp;lsquo;Jnani&amp;rsquo; says of the &amp;lsquo;Ajnani&amp;rsquo; that the latter believes, for instance, that his/her body is his/her &amp;rsquo;true&amp;rsquo; self, or that s/he thinks that s/he is the agent, or that s/he identifies her/his &amp;rsquo;true&amp;rsquo; self with money, beauty, power, etc. The &amp;lsquo;Jnani&amp;rsquo; might even &amp;lsquo;summarize&amp;rsquo; the explanation thus: s/he acts that way in the world because of &amp;lsquo;Ajnana&amp;rsquo;. But this summary is exactly that: a summary and not, in itself, an explanation which appeals to an absence acting causally in the world.&#xA;IV&#xA;Neither your analogy nor your argument is apt but I shall simply accept both for the time being.&#xA;You say, to begin with, that there could be no concept of &amp;lsquo;blindness&amp;rsquo; if all were to be blind. I do not know what makes you say this. We are not telepathic, our physics tells us that telekinesis is not possible, or that we cannot levitate, and so on. But that has not prevented us from having concepts about any of these. Since when do facts about the world act as restraints on human imagination? (Our Puranic stories are the best illustrations of my claim; just read about the powers that Rishis are supposed to have.)&#xA;And then you talk about blindness as a fictitious force. I lose you here. Why is this &amp;lsquo;fictitious&amp;rsquo;? We are &amp;lsquo;blind&amp;rsquo; to (i.e., we cannot see) infrared rays, electric and magnetic fields, and so on. In what sense is this blindness fictitious? This blindness is not a force, fictitious or otherwise. It merely spells out the limitations of human vision. Consider this. We hear sounds only on certain wavelengths. The dogs can hear sounds that we cannot. So, when a dog trainer blows a whistle that emits sounds we cannot hear, am I to assume that the dog reacts to &amp;lsquo;fictitious&amp;rsquo; sounds? Or that our deafness for this whistle is a &amp;lsquo;fictitious force&amp;rsquo;?&#xA;It is not at all clear to me what you are defending, why you are defending what you are, and what would happen if it turns out to be indefensible.&#xA;V&#xA;Your posts continue to puzzle me.  On the one hand, you make absolute claims about the limits of human imagination, namely, that it &amp;ldquo;CAN ONLY be a permutation and combination of our experiences&amp;rdquo;. On the other, you contradict yourself by speaking about the 4th dimension, which is beyond our experience, and which, you say, human beings cannot imagine. How did anybody come up with the notion and the mathematics of 4 dimensions if it could not be imagined?&#xA;Would you like to say that quantum physics, the n-dimensional mathematics, etc. are not products of human imagination and that, say, they are products of human creativity? That is to say, are you defining &amp;lsquo;human imagination&amp;rsquo; as that which cannot go beyond the macro-experiences we have? If this is the case, there is no point to a discussion because it becomes a dispute about definitions of words.&#xA;However, even under this interpretation, we CAN HAVE NOTIONS of blindness and vision (as products of human creativity) in the same way we have so many notions (and theories), which far outstrip anything our macro-world experience can provide us with.  Thus, I am puzzled.&#xA;VI&#xA;X says: &amp;ldquo;Lets suppose there is a prisoner who has been in prison all his  life. To him, that is how things are. He does not feel any limitations on freedom. He is free as it can be. Now to an outside  observer, this prisoner &amp;lsquo;seems&amp;rsquo; to be constrained. But&#xA;this &amp;lsquo;constraint&amp;rsquo; which is the cause of his limitation is only  in the outside observer&amp;rsquo;s mind not prisoner&amp;rsquo;s. So, there  is &amp;lsquo;constraint&amp;rsquo; from a certain frame of reference which is &amp;lsquo;causing&amp;rsquo;  limitations to the prisoners freedoms. But this can only be an&#xA;*appearance* of a cause and not a real cause because  the &amp;lsquo;constraint&amp;rsquo; comes into existence only from a certain frame of&#xA;reference (outside) but not to the prisioner. So this &amp;lsquo;constraint&amp;rsquo;  is both existence (from outside) and absence (for the prisoner).  how can such an entity cause? I think it is just an appearance of a  cause in the descriptions from a certain frame of reference.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;With the example of a prisoner, you are confusing issues. There is a difference between (a) the existence of things; (b) a particular description of the world which provides us with &amp;lsquo;causes&amp;rsquo;; (c) and some other description of the world. We might, if we so choose, take something that exists and identify it as a &amp;lsquo;cause&amp;rsquo;.  You seem to suggest that something or another is a &amp;lsquo;cause&amp;rsquo; accordingly as whether or not there exists a description, which shows that something is a &amp;lsquo;cause&amp;rsquo;. For the sake of argument, I am willing to buy this. In that case, though, you  cannot speak about &amp;lsquo;apparent causes&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;real causes&amp;rsquo;. (You cannot, because the distinction between &amp;lsquo;appearance&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;reality&amp;rsquo; has nothing to do with whether or not something is a cause in a particular description of the world.) Nor can you speak about their &amp;rsquo;existence&amp;rsquo;. (Because, the notion of &amp;lsquo;cause&amp;rsquo; is defined with respect to the place some concept occupies in a description of the world and NOT with respect to its position in the world.)  You will have to say: something is a cause, if there is a causal description that makes something into a cause. The confusion is simply this:  you speak as though the &amp;lsquo;presence of a concept AS A CAUSE&amp;rsquo; is identical to the &amp;rsquo;existence of an entity&amp;rsquo;. This confusion arises because you use the word &amp;rsquo;existence&amp;rsquo; in two senses: (a) as that entity which is; (b) as that concept which occupies a particular place in a description. The PRESENCE of some concept in a particular description does not guarantee the EXISTENCE of an object named by that concept anymore than the absence of that concept in another description of the world furnishes us with proof about the absence of the said object.&#xA;I am interested in understanding the Indian traditions. I would like to know whether I can formulate their problem is such a way that I can also recreate their debates. In one sense, our discussion suggests that it is possible: you recognize my formulation problem enough to come up with a defence of &amp;lsquo;jnana&amp;rsquo;. I suppose that is enough for the time being. As you say, we will continue our debates when we meet each other.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <link>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/moral-luck-and-gyanodaya/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#xA;I think that the multiple routes that exist in the Indian culture and those that individuals follow are on par with each other. From within any one of these, the other routes appear as moments. However, this does not privilege any one route above the other.&#xA;If one were to suggest, say, that the Puranic stories are simplifications of the Upanishadic insights then one has to endorse a claim of the following sort.  What makes some sets of sentences into a simplification of other sets of sentences is that the former leaves out nuances, qualifications, conditionalities, and so on of the latter. That is to say, the simplification is less true (or more conditionally true) than the complex version. In this way we would get a hierarchy of statements (from complex to the simple), where each succeeding simplification is less true than the predecessor. Only the statement at the apex of such a pyramid would be the truest of the lot. Then, we would have but one set of true statements. Relative to this set, all other statements would be false.&#xA;In such a case, there would be no plurality of traditions. There would be but one &amp;rsquo;true&amp;rsquo; path; all other paths would not lead us to the same goal as the true one does. Not only that. Under such a construction, enlightenment would not be something that all human beings could strive for and achieve; only &amp;lsquo;some&amp;rsquo; (those who are able to understand the Upanishadic claims) could do so. Consequently, one has to add a rider: only some people (endowed only in one particular way) could find happiness (eudaimonia, enlightenment).&#xA;The strength of the Indian traditions lies, amongst other things, in their unconditional claim: all human beings can find happiness. The differences between human beings (no matter whether this difference is biological, sociological, psychological in nature) matter only when it comes to the choice of the path best suited for them. If this statement is true, then the Puranic stories cannot be, under any interpretation of the word, simplifications of more complex claims.&#xA;II&#xA;I cannot quite figure out whether we are talking about different things or expressing differing points of view or simply using different words. I am talking about two contrast sets: &amp;lsquo;simplification&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;complexity&amp;rsquo;, whereas you seem to talk about &amp;lsquo;simplicity&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;complication&amp;rsquo; (also at times using &amp;lsquo;complex&amp;rsquo; as a synonym for &amp;lsquo;complicated&amp;rsquo;). You are right that simplification and complexity apply to descriptions; that is why I spoke of both of them in terms of &amp;lsquo;sets of sentences&amp;rsquo; (in some language or another). Let me explain what I mean.&#xA;If there is a &amp;lsquo;simple&amp;rsquo; and a &amp;lsquo;complicated&amp;rsquo; explanation available to me, and they are alternatives in the sense that they do more or less the same job in explaining what needs to be explained, then I would prefer a simple to a complicated explanation. Here, the difference between these two explanations resides in the fact that the complicated explanation uses more concepts than the simple one does but both do the same job. (Let us leave aside why I choose a simple explanation; the reasons have to do with my philosophical preferences.)&#xA;In the case of a &amp;lsquo;simplified&amp;rsquo; and a &amp;lsquo;complex&amp;rsquo; explanation, the situation is different. The simplified set of statements (mostly) makes use of non-technical vocabulary to get across the point of a complex explanation. The simplification leaves aside qualifications, presuppositions, conditions, etc. which are all required for the explanation to really explain some phenomenon or another. (Elegantly written popularizing books on physics, biology, chemistry, etc. belong to the class of simplifications of complex explanations.) So, all a layperson like me needs is a book that simplifies the complex explanations of the physicists about blackholes, of the geneticists about gene-sequencing, etc. in order for me to get some idea of what these physicists and geneticists are doing. Unlike a text-book in physics or in genetics, these popularizing books that simplify complex ideas DO NOT enable me to do physics or genetics. Instead, they make use of the rich resources of a natural language (similes, metaphors, analogies, examples, jokes, etc.) to get an idea approximately across to someone like me who lacks the technical expertise in the area or domain under consideration.&#xA;Now comes the question of the relationship between the Upanishadic statements and Puranic stories. If, as you seem to suggest now and then in your post to me, it is the case that Puranic stories tell me &amp;ldquo;in simple terms&amp;rdquo; something that the Upanishads make &amp;ldquo;complicated&amp;rdquo; (or render the same in &amp;lsquo;abstruse&amp;rsquo; terms, as you put it), then my choice is clear: go for the Puranic stories all the way.  Under this construal, Puranic stories are alternatives to the Upanishadic claims. I do not believe this to be the case.&#xA;Do the puranic stories simplify the complex claims of the Upanishads? If they did, analogous to what I said above, the puranic stories could not help me attain enlightenment, much the same way a popularizing book on modern day physics does not enable me to do research in physics today. Then, the only way I can do physics is by learning physics; similarly the only way to attain enlightenment would be to understand the Upanishads. I do not buy this either. That is why I do not think that Puranic stories are simplifications of the Upanishads.&#xA;III&#xA;Question: The relationship between the Puranas and the Upanishads with regards to simplification need not necessarily be of the type Popular Science Books : Physics Text Books. It could be of the type Undergraduate Physics Text Books : Graduate Physics Text Books. They could be dealing with same subject, but the coverage, depth, and rigour could be different. But both will help one learn Physics and do Physics.&#xA;A good point, even though it is not entirely clear to me what that point does to my argument. Therefore, let me think aloud and consider two ways in which undergraduate textbooks in physics help you to do physics.&#xA;Let us suppose you learn Snell&amp;rsquo;s law of refraction, Maxwell&amp;rsquo;s law of electro-magnetism and, say, an introductory chapter on Nuclear physics. Let us say that you also do some laboratory experiments on the first two. No doubt, you are learning to do physics now. Do they help you do research on Nuclear physics immediately  thereafter? Today, their function is entirely different: they are propaedeutics, courses that provide you with an introduction to the subject. They help you acquire the necessary apparatus to learn more and go deeper into the subject. They are not simplifications of complex explanations but ones that provide you with some rudimentary notions, using which you can learn other concepts. When you learn about the atomic value of an element in Chemistry, this piece of knowledge does not simplify. You merely learn that elements have atomic values and you might also learn something about what that word means. You will come across the idea of electrons, their orbits and nucleus. You are taught that electrons can be excited but you also learn that it has something to do with energy. In other words, the undergraduate texts prepare you for research; you do as laboratory experiments what research was to your predecessors. In this sense, because the frontier of knowledge keeps moving, the nature and kind of preparation required to do research also keeps shifting.&#xA;Do the Puranic stories have a similar propaedutic function with respect to the Upanishads? If they do, then you are suggesting something like the following: enlightenment consists of vertical hierarchy of knowledge elements and that one can become enlightened if and only if one has gone through the phase of undergraduation. If you want to argue this, then you are committed to saying that there is only one route to enlightenment. The other paths train you to tread the Upanishadic path. &amp;lsquo;All routes lead to Jnana&amp;rsquo; and only though that can you achieve enlightenment.&#xA;Three things require noting in this regard. One is that this is a description that those who follow this path provide with regard to other paths: all other paths are moments in one&amp;rsquo;s own path. While this could be true of one&amp;rsquo;s own development, it overlooks the fact that disciples of the other paths say exactly the same thing with respect to their own path. The second thing is that it makes enlightenment &amp;lsquo;conditional&amp;rsquo; upon possessing some specific ability or another. In the same way not every undergraduate student in physics can go on to do research in physics, it suggests that only some can attain enlightenment. The third thing is that such a position cannot account for the rivalry between the different Indian traditions: their rivalry is not at the level of a competition between different undergraduate texts, namely, which of the paths brings you to the path of &amp;lsquo;jnana&amp;rsquo; quicker and better. Instead, they claim that they all help you in achieving enlightenment and that &amp;lsquo;jnana&amp;rsquo; itself is but one of the paths to enlightenment.&#xA;Let me now consider the following question: is there any way of deciding which kind of research in physics is better? That is to say, is research in Plasma physics better than research in solid state physics, or doing research in astrophysics? The only way of making sense of this question is to relativize it to an individual&amp;rsquo;s concern of wanting to know the area in which s/he should do research: In which area do I want to do research and why?&#xA;The multiple paths to human happiness is something analogous to the above situation, as I see the issue. Being happy or enlightened (as you know, I use these two words as synonyms) is like doing research in physics. It is not an &amp;rsquo;end state&amp;rsquo;; it is a goal only in the sense of &amp;lsquo;doing research in physics&amp;rsquo; can be our goal. Whether you do research in plasma physics or solid state physics, you are doing research in physics; in the same way, Upanishads and puranas help you find happiness. There is no hierarchy of any sort between them.&#xA;IV&#xA;I intended to speak of &amp;ldquo;two ways in which undergraduate textbooks in physics help you to do physics&amp;rdquo; but ended up writing only about one way. Here is the second of the two ways I wanted to consider.&#xA;Assume, for a moment, that both Upanishads and Puranas are propaedeutics to &amp;ldquo;doing research&amp;rdquo;, i.e., to be happy. Could we then compare them and say which one of them is better? Though I cannot answer this question on the basis of my experience, I think even the enlightened would face the following issue, which I have often faced in my career.&#xA;When you have acquired the competence in some domain and are doing further research, people often ask you for a &amp;ldquo;good text book&amp;rdquo;. I find this an extremely difficult question to answer. The reason is this: I find a text book a &amp;lsquo;good one&amp;rsquo;, if it gives me (the experienced researcher) a very good overview of my field of research, beginning with (what I consider) rudimentary ideas. However, I have discovered (through my own experience) that what is a &amp;lsquo;good text book&amp;rsquo; to me is more often than not a &amp;lsquo;very bad text book&amp;rsquo;, if you look at it from a pedagogical point of view. One who begins learning a new field requires another kind of introduction than what I would consider a &amp;lsquo;good introduction&amp;rsquo;. As an experienced researcher, I find a systematic overview of my domain a &amp;lsquo;good introduction&amp;rsquo;; those who begin to learn a new domain require a good introduction to learn and not a &amp;lsquo;systematic overview&amp;rsquo;. Our requirements are different. That is also the reason why writing a &amp;lsquo;good text book&amp;rsquo; (or being a teacher) is not something every good researcher can do. Only some can be good teachers; only a few can write good text books.&#xA;In this sense, I believe that even the enlightened would face analogous problems. Some might find some or another Upanishad a &amp;lsquo;good introduction&amp;rsquo;; some find that just one of the Mahavakyas is enough; yet others find the puranic stories sublime. The only one who can decide about it is the student. What helps him/her to find happiness is the thing that works for that person. More, one cannot say.&#xA;V&#xA;You ask what I mean by this: Three things require noting in this regard. One is that this is a description that those who follow this path provide with regard to other paths: all other paths are moments in one&amp;rsquo;s own path. While this could be true of one&amp;rsquo;s own development, it overlooks the fact that disciples of the other paths say exactly the same thing with respect to their own path.&amp;quot;&#xA;What I mean: Bhakti, for instance, claims that it is the best path to enlightenment because both the &amp;lsquo;Karma&amp;rsquo; and the &amp;lsquo;jnana&amp;rsquo; path are the subordinate moments of Bhakti. (I speak about this more in detail in my “How to speak for the Indian traditions&amp;quot; article.) All I want to suggest is that teach path (karmic, Jnana, Bhakti, yogic, Tantric, meditative, etc) is special to the practitioner and S/he sees in it the presence of all other paths. We need to account for this stance&#xA;Why I say this in the context of the discussion: let us, for the time being, associate puranic stories with the practice of puja, and consider this too as a path to enlightenment. Were we to say that one does not achieve enlightenment through this manner and claim that only &amp;lsquo;jnana&amp;rsquo; leads one to enlightenment, then we cannot account for the claim (that many in our traditions make) that illiterate people, with their simple practice of doing a daily puja to some vigraha or another (or even to trees), also achieve enlightenment. In our accounts of and attempts at understanding enlightenment, we need to account for these claims. (We could account for them by saying they are false; but I take them seriously.)&#xA;You ask: &amp;ldquo;But what&amp;rsquo;s wrong with believing that only some can attain enlightenment? No-one&amp;rsquo;s claiming that some people are being forcibly shut out. Technically speaking, enlightenment is open to all. But to me your view is analogous to saying that everyone can be an opera singer or a fabulous dancer.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;One&amp;rsquo;s ability to become an opera singer or a fabulous dancer is conditional: it depends on one&amp;rsquo;s biological inheritance and one&amp;rsquo;s aptitude, among other things. It also depends on one&amp;rsquo;s skill and practice; one&amp;rsquo;s teachers and so on. Human happiness, according to how I understand the Indian traditions, is accessible to all. Every one of us can be happy. Not merely &amp;rsquo;technically&amp;rsquo;, as you put it, but also in reality. The fact, however, that all of us are not happy has led the Indian traditions to investigate things that stand in the way of human happiness. It has also made them discover various means and modalities to overcome these impediments. All human beings, if they seek happiness, can really become happy. The possibility of achieving this goal does not depend on  some kind of &amp;lsquo;moral luck&amp;rsquo;, the way being an opera singer or a fabulous dancer does. &amp;ldquo;Seek, and ye shall find&amp;rdquo;, our traditions seem to say. (I speak about these things more in detail in the talk I gave at the Catholic University of Louvain.) Finding happiness is not a question of accident or luck; it is the guaranteed result of a search.&#xA;Is Enlightenment different from happiness? Well, here one chooses one&amp;rsquo;s own terminology, I guess. The happiness that I speak about is what Aristotle called &amp;lsquo;Eudaimonia&amp;rsquo;: as that which if a person has, s/he will never lose. There might be more to enlightenment than happiness, as defined above. However, I do believe that enlightenment is the only &amp;lsquo;property&amp;rsquo; which, if you once have it, you will never lose. No other human quality has this nature.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/what-does-it-mean-to-be-indian/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here is a new book by S. N. Balagangadhara and Sarika Rao: &lt;em&gt;What does it mean to be &amp;lsquo;Indian&amp;rsquo;?&lt;/em&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/What-does-mean-be-Indian/dp/1685097715/&#34;&gt;US version&lt;/a&gt; can be had for $12.00; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.in/What-does-mean-be-Indian/dp/1685234631/&#34;&gt;Indian version&lt;/a&gt; for Rs. 349. Here are the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.co.uk/What-does-mean-be-Indian/dp/1685097715/&#34;&gt;UK,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.ca/What-does-mean-be-Indian/dp/1685097715/&#34;&gt;Candian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.de/dp/1685097715&#34;&gt;EU&lt;/a&gt; versions.&#xA;Any questions, comments are welcome and you can post it on&lt;a href=&#34;https://groups.io/g/TheHeathenInHisBlindness&#34;&gt;https://groups.io/g/TheHeathenInHisBlindness&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;This &lt;strong&gt;book&lt;/strong&gt;  tries to answer a question that is also its title. This book shares some of the results of 40 years of research in the Research Programme Comparative Science of Cultures. It plots the outlines of the differences that distinguish one culture from another, Indian and western in our case. The narrative does not track differences between nations, societies or religions but investigates domains like experience, sense of the past and constructions of the self to sketch a possible answer to the question. The book straddles the fields of social sciences and humanities to tackle issues of knowledge about culture and exhibits the relevance of these areas of enquiry to us all. It suggests an alternative to the ruling orthodoxies that constitute ‘identity politics’ today while showing that this label hides more content than even what their best proponents imagine.&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;Written in a non-academic language and an accessible style&lt;/strong&gt;, the book addresses an intelligent but lay public. Consequently, it contains neither many citations nor any references. However, what it conveys is based on a scientific research programme, whose results are published in scientific journals and research monographs. It also formulates interesting hypotheses currently under investigation.&#xA;Today the question &lt;em&gt;What does it mean to be ‘Indian’?&lt;/em&gt; faces difficulty. Is it a motto like ‘E Pluribus Unum’ or ‘satyameva jayate’? Is it a ‘colourful’ and ‘beautiful’ culture where people wear bindis, deck themselves in Kanchipuram Silk and do puja? Is it a question of national borders and territories? Or is it an institutional question: about educational institutions, courts of law, a huge parliament or even being the world’s ‘largest’ democracy? Do we belong to a culture of oppression, exploitation and conflict or do we aspire to draw the divine nectar by churning the ocean? Is there something ‘Indian’ about our culture that goes beyond the differences between Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs or Jains? What does it &lt;em&gt;überhaupt&lt;/em&gt; mean to belong to Indian culture?&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;Why ask this question today?&lt;/strong&gt; Do we not know the answers? After all, as we know, a lot is written about India, her culture, her past, her society, the psychology and sociology of individuals and their groups. Why is that not enough to answer the query about what it means to be ‘Indian’?&#xA;It is because what we have learnt about ourselves so far is either false or very fragmentary. Whether one claims that India is a class society or a caste society or a combination of both, one is not saying much. Such a claim merely tells us that India too has a society and that it either fully or partially mirrors other societies and people one way or another. Our question is not whether we are also human beings, whether we also have a social and cultural life, but &lt;em&gt;what kind of people we are, where we are coming from and where should we head as a society, as a culture and as individuals&lt;/em&gt;. Thus, we ask: what does it mean to be ‘Indian’?&#xA;In answering this question, this book &lt;strong&gt;transcends the distinction between ‘the right’ and ‘the left’ by looking deeper into ideas of human beings, society, culture, experience, past&lt;/strong&gt; and other related clusters. One such element is the colonial past of India which is of relevance not merely to the colonised but to the coloniser as well. It is through the British that India is drawn into western culture, transforming both herself and the West in the process. In outlining its contours, the book shows why its question is relevant not just to the citizens of a country or to members of a culture but to all of us who consider ourselves human beings.&#xA;Indian intellectuals have vacillated between virtue-signalling and moral indignation; they have completely given up all intellectual questions and responsibilities. This has resulted in a large, &lt;strong&gt;intelligent and educated populace that is hungry for insights that make sense of their world&lt;/strong&gt;. This group, in India (and abroad), is fed up with being told that they ought to be ashamed of being Indian, of belonging to the &amp;rsquo;third world&amp;rsquo; and are no longer convinced that they ought to become as western as quickly as possible. Their numbers are growing by the day. This group ranges from the Millennials entering their thirties to the young retirees entering their sixties. This is the first generation of the middle class, which emerged in the 80s and 90s. These Millennials who grew up believing themselves to be ‘global citizens’ are now confronted with the inadequacy of the stories they have. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘What does it mean to be an Indian, in the 21st century?’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is a question they are confronting as an actuality with real-world implications. This is a question raised at the level of culture and can only be answered at that level. Neither nationalism nor identity-politics are satisfactory.&#xA;This book is sui generis and fills a lacuna that few have identified, let alone addressed. If Asian culture is not simply a slightly inferior, slightly idiosyncratic variant of European culture, as we have been told for a very long time, what else is it? Hence, the corollary question: What does it mean to be an Indian? The author can ask and answer this question because he has theorised on a larger question in his four decades of research: &lt;strong&gt;What makes a difference, any difference, into a cultural difference and not a social, psychological or biological difference?&lt;/strong&gt; As of today, there is no competition. There are books that slice the question in old and familiar ways: religion, politics, spirituality, sociology etc. These familiar stories in their various permutations and combinations have not only grown stale but are demonstrably useless.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Swami, the Priest, and the Rediscovery of the Indian Traditions</title>
      <link>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/the-swami-the-priest-and-the-rediscovery-of-the-indian-traditions/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 22 Sep 2020 17:50:55 +0530</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/the-swami-the-priest-and-the-rediscovery-of-the-indian-traditions/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I will take up some of the general points, which I think are relevant to the Indian American community at large. First, let me say I am impressed by the dynamism present in this community. In spite of the demands of daily life, Indian Americans find the time and energy to engage in intellectual debates about the nature of their traditions. In spite of the discrimination and &amp;ldquo;religion oppression&amp;rdquo; [1] faced by them, there is a general sense of optimism about the future of these traditions.&#xA;It is important that this dynamism remain a positive force. Some Indian Americans have adopted the name-calling that we find among certain American academics. Whereas the latter call anyone who dares say a few positive words about the Indian traditions &amp;ldquo;a Hindutva sycophant,&amp;rdquo; the former trend to label any western intellectual who dares question the dominant representations of the Indian traditions as a &amp;ldquo;Witzellian.&amp;rdquo; The legitimate discontent about the academic representation of the Indian traditions should not lead us to a general anti-intellectual stance. Anti-intellectualism knows only one endpoint: the &lt;em&gt;Taliban&lt;/em&gt;. Now, if there is one community aware of the duty to avoid that society moves towards that point, it is the Indian American community. Since intellectuals share this sense of duty, our study of the Indian traditions should show how they can contribute to making American society a more tolerant, open-minded and happier society.&#xA;As Chitra Raman affirms, the Indian traditions have been conceptualized in an extremely impoverished manner during the last few centuries. It is the hypothesis of our research group that this is the case because they have been viewed &lt;em&gt;through a secularized biblical framework&lt;/em&gt;. [2] The same framework also puts conceptual limitations on the structure of American pluralism. This is not an assessment about the origins of this form of pluralism or a judgment about its biased nature, but rather a &lt;em&gt;cognitive&lt;/em&gt; analysis of its contemporary structure. Such an analysis cannot be challenged by a moralizing judgement (e.g., that it justifies discrimination). The only way to really challenge my hypothesis is to develop another hypothesis about the structure of American pluralism. Naturally, its purpose is to develop new ways of solving the problems of pluralism in the U.S. To do so, one should indeed strive to bring American pluralism beyond its biblical straitjacket in the near future. Perhaps, no group is as qualified to do so as the Indian Americans.&#xA;But before they can take up this task, they should understand the depth of the predicament. Even more so, they have to become aware that they have appropriated the secularized Christian conception of the Indian traditions as a self-description. The predicament we face is &lt;em&gt;cognitive&lt;/em&gt; in nature: the currently dominant conception of the Indian traditions makes sense only against the background of the biblical framework. It is cognitive in the sense that the way we currently think and talk about “Hinduism” leads to a distortion of the very nature of the Indian traditions. This dominant conception of “Hinduism” does not describe these traditions themselves, but rather &lt;em&gt;how they appear through western and Christian lenses&lt;/em&gt;. Yet many Indians and Indian Americans talk as though this conception makes eminent sense to them.&#xA;Chitra Raman develops a nice analogy: it is like using the grammar of one language to understand another. One may adopt the words of the second language, but when one embeds them in the grammatical structure of the first language, one ends up with virtual gibberish. The analogy can be taken further: today, it is as though the native speakers of the second language have accepted the grammatical structure of the first language as the only correct one and they try to speak their own language in this way. This is the nature of our predicament: many Indians and Indian Americans have adopted the conceptual framework of Christianity to talk about their own traditions. They assume the Indian traditions are a belief system or religion with its own doctrines, commandments and rules. As I will try to show, this makes about as much sense as using the grammatical structure of one language to speak another completely different language.&#xA;To avoid any misunderstanding, let it be clear that the denial that the Indian traditions are of the same nature as biblical religion does not involve any value judgement. They also have a highly-developed structure, but this is so different from Judaism, Christianity and Islam that it is impossible to maintain that the Indian traditions and the latter three are instances of the same kind. In fact, once we appreciate how different the Indian traditions are from these religions, we will rediscover how rich and valuable they really are. To return to the language analogy: if we used the grammatical structure of one language to speak another, we would not be able to understand this second language and would also ignore its rich contributions to literature, philosophy and poetry. It is only when we rediscover the structure of this second language that its treasures become available to us. Similarly, when we rediscover the nature of the Indian traditions and rescue them from being transformed into just another religion, we will be able to show how they have contributed to the pursuit of knowledge at a level undreamt of.&#xA;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Priest and the Swami&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&#xA;In &lt;em&gt;Facing the Challenge of American Pluralism&lt;/em&gt;, I argued that the Indian traditions revolve around the exploring and examining of one’s experience so as to attain perfect happiness. What does this mean? How is it different from what religions like Christianity and Islam do? As an entry point, take a Hindu swamiji and a Christian priest. The priest says “God is a Trinity.” The swamiji says “&lt;em&gt;Tat Tvam Asi&lt;/em&gt;.” What is the difference between the two?&#xA;First the priest. The sentence “God is a Trinity” is a doctrine to him; it is a proposition about the world, which he takes to be absolutely true. Because it is a doctrine, the sentence is embedded in an elaborate theological system. It is related to other sentences that explain its true meaning: theological doctrines about Jesus being the Son of God and the Father, the Son and the Spirit being one substance, but three persons. Arguments have been developed to establish the truth of the Trinitarian doctrine. Its correct formulation was discussed and fixed at the First Council of Nicea in 325 AD. The result is the Nicene Creed: a set of beliefs that are held to reflect religious truth by most Christian denominations. As a Christian believer, when the priest says “God is a Trinity,” one is expected to accept this as a true belief, a doctrine embedded in a belief system that claims the one and only religious truth. As an orthodox Christian today, one should understand this doctrine, proclaim its truth and be able to defend it against its detractors. One should not question its truth and meaning. These have been fixed for good.&#xA;Now the swamiji. When he states “&lt;em&gt;Tat Tvam Asi&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt;”&lt;/em&gt; does he expect all Hindus to accept this sentence as a true doctrine? Does he want them to take this as a true belief, whose truth they should proclaim and defend against the “false beliefs” of other religions? Does he expect them to memorize the sentence and its related doctrines and arguments, and repeat them until eternity? No, he does not. When the swamiji teaches, he takes into account the different levels and experiences of his audience. He will explain “&lt;em&gt;Tat Tvam Asi&lt;/em&gt;” in different ways according to the different experiential levels of individuals. The sentence does not have one fixed true meaning, precisely because it functions as an instruction for exploring one’s own experience. It suggests that the distinction between I and not-I is a temporary figment that results from interpreting our experience in a particular way. If we examine this experience at a deeper level, we will slowly discover that there is no such distinction there. The swamiji’s explanation of the sentence will make sense to us, according to where we are on the path towards this discovery.&#xA;Hence, neither the speech of the &lt;em&gt;swamiji&lt;/em&gt; nor the texts of the Indian traditions can be understood as belief systems or doctrines, which have a fixed meaning and claim to reflect the one religious truth. They are “heuristics” that function as instructions for action to explore our own experience. To attain the insights embodied in these sentences, one has to examine them from all sides, relate them to one’s experience and question their truth repeatedly. Only in this way can they help us become better and happier human beings. The claim of the Indian traditions is not that we should accept them as true doctrines or that such acceptance is a precondition for attaining salvation. They do not postpone perfect happiness until after death. Neither do they claim that there is only one true path to attain this state. Rather, they claim that all human beings can attain perfect happiness here on earth and that there are countless ways to achieve this goal.&#xA;Those who conceptualize the Indian traditions as “belief systems,” “doctrines” or “religion” take away the unique nature of these traditions. They make the rich storehouse of experiential knowledge embodied by these traditions inaccessible and do so by transforming them into a belief system, the Hindu equivalent of Christianity or Islam. Let it be clear that the Indian traditions are neither belief systems nor religions. They are far more fascinating than that. I refer you to the piece by my teacher S. N. Balagangadhara (soon to be published on the India Forum website) to get a glimpse of how rich these traditions are. Here, just note that it is &lt;em&gt;precisely the way in which the Indian traditions are different from belief systems, which makes them into extremely important but uncharted contributions to the human pursuit of knowledge&lt;/em&gt;.&#xA;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transforming the Swami into a Priest&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&#xA;But what happens when we reduce the Indian traditions into a Hindu “religion,” “world view” or “belief system”? What are the consequences of transforming the swamiji into a priest? Why is this development so harmful?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt;. In this talk, I would like to focus on the two attitudes that I have towards your project. It is not that I have ambiguous feelings; no, I have two distinct feelings. On the one hand, I am convinced that you will not reach your goal because such a goal is unreachable. Not only that. Your goal is undesirable and best abandoned. On the other hand, if you strive with integrity, clarity and passion to reach your goal, in the process, you will achieve results that are desirable, necessary and important. So, I would like to support and encourage your project. On the one hand, I believe that I can develop a few impossibility arguments that will show why you best abandon your project; on the other hand, I have given no thought to developing such a set of arguments because I want you to work further towards your goal so that you produce the results that we, as humankind, need. This might suggest that I am ambiguous toward your project, but, as I said, I am not. To explain thus attitude better, let me use an illustration from the history of philosophy (albeit in a slightly caricatured form),&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are multiple kinds of interpretation. For instance, there is interpretation of symbols in a domain like Physics: μ (in elementary optics) is &amp;ldquo;interpreted&amp;rdquo; as the refraction index of a substance. We use a more or less analogous notion of &amp;ldquo;interpretation&amp;rdquo; in Chemistry, Mathematics and so on. In logic, we speak of &amp;ldquo;interpretation of variables&amp;rdquo; like &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;, etc. Here, it means that the letters stand-in for arbitrary sentences with truth-values.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Historiography and Myths</title>
      <link>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/historiography-and-myths/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The western intellectual tradition has bemoaned the fact that the Indians never indulged in history-writing (or historiography). In this tradition, there is an obsessive need for collecting &amp;ldquo;facts&amp;rdquo; about the past. This is partly the result of how Judaism, Christianity and Islam (the three Semitic religions) look at themselves and their own past: everything they claim about their past (the Flood, the temple of Solomon, the coming of Christ, etc.) should not only be true but proven so beyond all doubt. They have to be true (in the sense that their recounting of the past should also be confirmed by research) because these religions live or die accordingly as whether it is also true what they say effectively happened on earth. These facts (like the existence of, say, the Temple of Solomon in the Israel of today and the Judea of yesterday or the existence of Jesus of Nazareth), in their turn, prove the truth about Moses and his tablet and the truth of the promise of God to the children of Israel. If the recounting of their past turns out to be false (like, say, the absence of any of the above two) would destroy their existence: if there was never a historical Jesus of Nazareth, Christianity would collapse like a house of cards. (In fact, Julian the Apostate, the nephew of the Emperor Constantine, set out to rebuild the Temple of Solomon at its original site precisely in order to do this. His early death, viewed both by the Jews and the Christians as an act of God, put an end to this project.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Two caveats. One: the commentary is very, very short. To write down all the things I want to say about this citation requires a long paper and not a brief mail. Two: I have not checked either the citation or the reference (Brihadaranyaka upanishad - I.iv.10). I assume that both are accurate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This (Self) was indeed Brahman in the beginning. It knew itself only as &amp;ldquo;I am Brahman.&amp;rdquo; Therefore it became all.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Assume that you get a Ph.D student who wants to do medical research. He comes to you and tells you that he wants to find out an answer to the burning question about why people get sick. Would you be able to guide this student in answering his question or give one answer to it? Your answer would be: it depends. You would also further say to him, ‘choose a particular disease, choose a particular domain and choose a particular approach within that domain, if you want to do research’. There is no ‘one answer’ to his question. As a research question, you would say it is ill-formed: you have to specify the disease, and choose whether you want to do, say, genetic research or epidemiological research or cell research or…&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Question: “Certainly that Brahman == self-awareness == Atman is also a matter of direct experience, not of intellectual reasoning?”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let me first begin with reason and then drift towards experience.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Suppose, as an expansion of the sentence that ‘Atman is Brahman’, it is said: “Atman and Brahman are identical to each other”. What kind of sense does it make and how do we explain that sense? Let us note that this sentence makes linguistic sense. Therefore, the question is, how do you parse this sentence to bring out that sense?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Atman, Witness, and Experience</title>
      <link>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/atman-and-experience/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 02 May 2020 10:56:38 +0530</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/atman-and-experience/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some Swamiji claims: “One cannot experience the Atman[, the Atman] is the witness, it is what experiences.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Obviously, this is a very rough and approximate formulation. This statement is both wrong and right in different ways. (a) In the very early days, when I began to develop my meditation exercise, I ‘sensed’ the vague presence of an observer (somewhere present in the background of my experiential world). Or, you could say, I vaguely sensed that I was being ‘seen’ or that my meditative performance was being performed for an ‘outside’ observer. Perhaps, it would also be accurate to say that I sensed its vague presence outside my meditative world, but touching upon its edges. Later, when I was trying to help other people meditate, I discovered that some sensed this presence too and yet others had to ‘let go’ in order to sense this presence. I am guessing that this is the idea of Atman as a ‘witness’. Some were fearful and afraid of this presence as well. If you say that to sense the vague presence is to experience that presence, the Swamiji is wrong. If you see this vague sensing of a presence (or sensing the vague presence of something) as not experiencing, the Swamij would be right. (b) Does the Atman experience? If you keep the word ‘experience’ sufficiently broad (or nebulous), yes, that is true. Self-awareness is obviously ‘aware’ (working purely at a linguistic level); self-consciousness is obviously ‘conscious’ (I say this in my note as well to understand the access). In this sense, yes, the Swamiji is right. However, the Swamiji is wrong if we claim, which we have to, that experience (as we know it today) requires some kind of bodily constraint (i.e. the presence of an apparatus to experience). We have to say here that self-consciousness is not tantamount to ‘experience’. Then the question opens up: if self-consciousness is not ‘experience’ what else is it? I have no answer except to say that it is ‘self-consciousness’, period. It is also further true, on both accounts, that &lt;strong&gt;sentience does not experience self-consciousness but merely accesses it.&lt;/strong&gt; In that case, the next problem: what does this access generate? Some or another kind of experience or not? If we cannot provide some kind of a satisfactory answer, the word ‘access’ is an occult word and does no work. (These are not the only set of problems, but it does indicate why understanding ‘enlightenment’ is far, far more difficult than achieving that state.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Shakti vs. Natural Sciences</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/shakti-vs-natural-sciences/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;You say that you experienced Shakti as an emanation of a force that is overpowering and palpable; you also say that you felt the ‘presence’ of Shakti strongly. These two sentences make one think that you felt the presence of the force. In that case, there are only two routes open to us: (a) either reject that we have knowledge of the world which forbids linguistic utterances from infusing material objects with ‘life’ forces that can have causal impact in the world; (b) or ‘downgrade’ science as knowledge of the world by allowing ‘spiritual’ (or supra-mundane) worlds to causally interact with the ‘physical’ world. Your own process of thinking about this experience is rigidly hemmed in by these alternatives. Neither, I think, is what you are seeking. If you are, you cannot and will not find what you seek, even if it is to merely figure out your experience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>&#39;Grotesque&#39; nature of Murtis</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/grotesque-nature-of-murtis/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Consider the fact that the Indian ‘gods’ are portrayed in at least two ways. First, there is their portrayal with four arms (say) and there is their portrayal in completely human forms. Krishna has four arms (with Shankha, Chakra, Gada and Padma or one hand with a blessing palm or downward indicating a mudra of some kind) and he also has a fully human form. The balakrishna’s I have seen give him only two arms. So do many images of Krishna: he has only two arms. However, apart from other symbols (flute, peacock feather, etc), his colour is almost invariant. Ganesha is even more interesting: there are balaganesha’s crawling with two arms and with four arms. There are images of a four-armed Ganesha sitting on the lap of a two-armed Shiva (with and without his third eye but holding a trishula). In any case, he has the elephant head. Most Durga’s have multiple arms, a few frightening heads but there are also those with human form and pretty faces. Same applies to Parvati, Laxmi and Saraswati. Except, of course, they invariably have pretty faces. They too have characteristic traits: seated on Padma, carrying a Veena, or next to Shiva or Ganesha or sitting on top of a mountain surrounded by snowy peaks. There are also others where she is on a peetha or is very well dressed and adorned with ornaments. In short, some or another trait is mostly present that identifies which ‘goddess’ or ‘god’ s/he is. The rest, obviously, is left free. Of course, there are also images that can only be identified, if so identified by local stories, the pujari’s at the temples and so on. If these are our ‘popular gods’, the less-known (say the village ‘goddesses’) are even more problematic. Many village ‘goddesses’ look similarly vague and are almost but not quite amorphous.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Examples of Real vs. Existence</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Two points should be kept in mind before using these examples: (a) the examples illustrate that the distinctions are not unknown to an English language-user (b) the distinction does not require denying the knowledge that we have about the world. These merely indicate that the distinction between ‘real’ and ‘existence’ might be worth a serious investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A possible set of examples&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not Real but exists&lt;/strong&gt; : the Earth, Planets, Stars, etc.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question&lt;/strong&gt;: I have some problems understanding &lt;em&gt;apara, para, existence, and presence&lt;/em&gt;. Apara exists, but is not present; para is present but does not exist. Are you saying that what is present does not exist, what exists is not present? If so, how can you reconcile with our common sense notion that what exists is present?  Even though presence doesn’t imply existence, we can’t say that existence imply non-presence. So, this is an issue of definitional equivalence: para = presence; apara = existence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It would be a good thing to narrow-in on the ‘spookiness’ of the accessing &amp;lsquo;Real&amp;rsquo;. However, because there is a very great danger that ‘access’ can be conceptualised as an access to a ‘supra-mundane’ or a ‘spiritual’ world, or to a world that is not accessible to ‘sciences’  but can be ‘spiritually’ accessed, etc. a few extra words are required. Therefore, an attempt that might reduce one possible kind of spookiness that you might be referring to.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Let us agree on the proposed division into two categories: “1) That which exists or could exist (2) That which could not and does not exist but is present (therefore ‘Real’)”. Let us also accept that (1) collects: “(a) everything that we know like Earth, stars, mud, (b) everything that we can think of or imagine - models, formulas, triangles, present and future scientific theories, tooth fairies, ‘murtis’ of Ganesha, methods or procedures of performing ‘abhisheka’ etc. (these exist and could exist in our minds, even the ‘Real’ we imagine still belongs here as long as it is an imagined object)”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here is how, rightly in my view, you formulate the challenge facing us:  So, the challenge you (and people like me who find your explanations very interesting) face is to figure out a comprehensive, viable and sustainable alternate ‘clustering structure’ (the modern complex organization) that will deliver the complex goods and services needed in today’s economy while getting rid of the cultural distortions which give rise to ‘corruption’.&#xA;Here, then, is my invitation and the reason for extending it.&#xA;(a) Are there people out there who are well-versed in Management theories (theory of firm, management control systems, organisational theory, etc) and sufficiently practical enough to undertake a medium to long-term research on the “relation between culture and management”? This research requires an intermeshing of the theories of organisation, my own studies on culture, and historical research into how public services were organised in India. Such research would help us develop an alternate “clustering structure”, as Arjun calls it.&#xA;(b) If there are people out there well-versed in any of the above three areas and are willing to work along (either directly through participation or indirectly by facilitating others to undertake such a research), could you please get in touch with me off-line? We can have exchanges through the e-mail and we can meet up with each other sometime in April in the US to talk the concrete steps through. (I will be coming to the US in April.)&#xA;(c) Such a research would enable us to develop not just an alternate description of India but also help evolving an alternate theory of organisation, which could get tested in practical life.&#xA;(d) About my reason for extending the invitation. Not being a management specialist, it would take me at least a few years to become familiar with the extant theories about it. I simply do not have that time. I am willing, however, to work along and guide those who want to do research because I have *already* spent some time doing preliminary work on the subject. I am convinced that this is a gold-mine and I do believe that we will advance our understanding about the relation between culture and management (which every business manager confronts practically when he sets up business in India) in very interesting and concrete ways.&#xA;Any takers?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Evolution of &#39;Supererogation&#39;</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/evolution-of-supererogation/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is advisable to get into a discussion about this question only after one knows what ‘supererogation’ means and how it has been discussed for centuries.  In the Greek ethics (especially as Aristotle formulated it), the notion plays a very crucial role without it being related to a normative sense of duty. With the Catholics, especially as Aquinas gave expression to it, a normative notion of duty cohabits the moral universe together with supererogation. To the Protestants, it makes sense to speak only of duty and not of supererogation because the latter does not simply exist. Without understanding the issues involved in these controversies, to make a bald assertion about supererogation (while appealing to a Protestant commonsense idea of duty without even realizing its Protestant origin) is to “…rush in, where Angels fear to tread”.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When you provide a moral criticism of someone, you are saying that such a person is morally wrong. If you bracket, for a moment, my writings and talks on the subject, then you see that no moral criticisms are possible without using a normative language.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;About realizing moral ideals: do you know any way of showing how some or another event in the world is not an &amp;lsquo;imperfect&amp;rsquo; realization of the relevant moral ideal? In fact, a reasonably capable intellectual acrobat could show that Nazism or Idi Amin&amp;rsquo;s Uganda were merely &amp;lsquo;imperfect&amp;rsquo; moral realizations of United Nations Declaration of Human Rights or that they did &amp;lsquo;realize&amp;rsquo; the moral ideals albeit in an &amp;lsquo;imperfect&amp;rsquo; manner. The problem is this: we cannot put limiting conditions on the degrees of imperfection unless one compares. Even that is quite problematic: is the US, with the NSA surveillance of its citizens, less or more &amp;lsquo;imperfect&amp;rsquo; than France, which very recently demanded the introduction of fingerprinting (and other biometric identifications ) for EU citizens traveling within the EU countries?  With the vast array of CCTV&amp;rsquo;s monitoring its streets, is UK, previously the home of Locke and Mill, any less or any more the &amp;rsquo;land of freedom&amp;rsquo; it was and is alleged to be? Is it an &amp;lsquo;imperfect&amp;rsquo; realization or a severe deformation of the relevant moral ideals?  The only real and practical use of the normative ethical theories appear to be: justify any immoral behavior as an &amp;lsquo;imperfect&amp;rsquo; realization of a noble moral ideal.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Note: For a broader application and context, please read this paper: &lt;a href=&#34;https://sites.google.com/site/colonialconsciousness/2014-comparative-theology.pdf&#34;&gt;translation, interpretation and culture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The word &amp;rsquo;temple&amp;rsquo; is not used in English to refer to a place where false gods are worshipped. It is used to speak of &amp;ldquo;the temple of Solomon&amp;rdquo; (the king Solomon of the Jews) too and there is no suggestion in the western culture that the Jews worshipped false gods.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Your friend is providing you with an identifying description: &amp;ldquo;this building which&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; and identifies it in terms of several functions tied to that building.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The word &amp;lsquo;yoni&amp;rsquo; here does much more work than one assumes. All the four are born from &amp;lsquo;Yoni&amp;rsquo; but yet are distinguished in terms of punya and paapa. The last two are earnt by the organism in question: &amp;lsquo;svayaarjita&amp;rsquo;, suggesting that being a brahmana and a rajarshi are earnt titles. As against it, we have a gender and a shudra. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;(a) Paolo Friere, a Brazilian educationalist, has spoken about such a phenomenon at length in his &lt;em&gt;Pedagogy of the Oppressed&lt;/em&gt;. He calls it as an ‘internalisation of the oppressor by the oppressed’. Whether we use Paolo Friere’s terminology or the much later one of ‘Stockholm Syndrome’, the problem is the same: both &lt;em&gt;name&lt;/em&gt; the phenomenon without &lt;em&gt;explaining it&lt;/em&gt;. In and of itself, not such a big problem if it is not for a cognitive tendency that is &lt;strong&gt;dominant&lt;/strong&gt; in the ‘social sciences’, which brings me to the second point.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps, one of the ways to test whether your search is taking you in the right direction is by seeing whether it solves a well-known paradox, or explicates it in a novel way. If after research, your hypothesis leads you to a well-known discussion in theology (but &lt;em&gt;lacks&lt;/em&gt; the latter&amp;rsquo;s sophistication), then you could be on an uninteresting track.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In certain phases of thinking, unbridled speculations have a serious contribution to make. After some time, it teaches one that there is a very interesting difference between &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/arguments-vs-theories/&#34;&gt;disciplined speculations and speculations of other sorts&lt;/a&gt; and that one has to learn the former. However, the only way to learn the former is through the latter.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let us suppose that some school or another in India also prescribes uniform to its students. A Sikh boy and a Muslim girl enroll. They wear the colors of the school, including the right colored turban (or, if the Sikh kid is too young, his hair tied up in a knot) and the right-colored head scarf. From what I know of the Indian schools, most schools (including the fellow-students) would let the situation stand. Assume that some school makes an issue about this. The parents do not have many choices: either the Sikh family shaves the boy (unlikely), or step to the courts (more likely today than yesterday) or look for another school (most likely) if persuading the school authorities fails. If we look at the tolerance of the school authorities, it appears to me that the following can be said: in all probability, it does not occur to them that, in keeping the turban or the head scarf on, the kids are marking themselves off or that there is discrimination involved in allowing this. The question is: how do they look at the turban (or the tied knot of hair) or at the scarf?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We can all accept the fact, I suppose, that some thing or another is a religious symbol to someone when s/he belongs to that religion whose symbol it is. In this sense, the Cross (for a long period of time), the figure of the Prophet Mohammed (also for a long period of time) and the star of David (in the course of this century) are symbols that carry religious significance to the Christians, Muslims and the Jews respectively. We are also agreed, I suppose, that there is no way of characterizing any of these as religious symbols in a religiously neutral way.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It would be interesting to answer the question of whether or not The Lord of the Rings (LOTR) is a religious story by testing against &amp;lsquo;religion is an explanatorily intelligible account of the Cosmos&amp;rsquo;. Does the Lord of the Rings give an account in which the causal and intentional explanations for the happenings in Middle Earth fall together?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the problems in testing a scientific theory and of developing one, I might add, is to ask the right question. The other problem, of course, is to find the right answer. Let us first take a step back and look at the claim.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I keep teaching my students the need to unlearn: unlearn the desire to &amp;lsquo;show off&amp;rsquo; their erudition; unlearn shallowness and so on. I am more than convinced that whatever we have learnt about human beings can be formulated in a jargon-free language and in a simple manner. There is no need to appear &amp;lsquo;mysterious and profound&amp;rsquo;; nor is there a need for exhibiting one&amp;rsquo;s erudition or &amp;lsquo;critical capacities&amp;rsquo;. On all these counts, most of Foucalt&amp;rsquo;s writings (and that of his commentators) can only call forth anger and irritation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was expecting you to show me where &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/intentional-operator-and-inconsistent-reasoning/&#34;&gt;the reasoning I formulated goes wrong&lt;/a&gt;, but you do not do so. The analogy you draw, I am afraid, does not quite do the job you want it to.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;One can easily hold the following two beliefs (your example) without any fear of contradiction:&#xA;(a) There is only one way to Bombay (this is it) and (b) There are many ways to Bombay (this is one of them).&#xA;The &amp;lsquo;how&amp;rsquo; of it must be obvious: the &amp;rsquo;this&amp;rsquo; is an indexical. Consequently, any person can hold both these beliefs together (at the same time or about the same route) without being contradictory (depending upon what he points out using the word &amp;rsquo;this&amp;rsquo;).&#xA;In fact, even statements like (c) &amp;ldquo;Route 19 is the only way to Bombay&amp;rdquo; and (d) &amp;ldquo;Route 24 is one of the ways to Bombay&amp;rdquo; can be held to be true by one and the same person at the same time without fear of contradiction. ( Both  statements would be true if Route 24 allows one to join Route 19 at some point or the other.) In other words, Minimus, your examples do not work the way you want them to.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Regarding my reasoning, this is what you say:&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hindus may have ideas/opinions about the beliefs of the Christians but &amp;ldquo;beliefs about&amp;rdquo; cannot be compared to &amp;ldquo;beliefs&amp;rdquo; and I think that is the error.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Central features of studies on Caste</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://creative.sulekha.com/the-hindu-defeat-role-of-caste_103411_blog&#34;&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; on Sulekha says:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;ut there can be no doubt that for the past thousand years at least the caste system has been a great nightmare for the majority of our people and continues to be a great bane of hindu society as well as hinduism today.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When you write this article on the caste system, I do want you very much to make clear where your &lt;em&gt;certainty&lt;/em&gt; regarding the nature of the caste system and its baneful impact both on the hindu and the indian society comes from. There is a reason for this request. For some time, I too thought that the ‘Indian caste system’ was an abomination. In order to find out where it came from, the nature of its foundations, and the causes for its continued reproduction, I started reading and researching into the question. Normally, research renders the questions &lt;strong&gt;sharper&lt;/strong&gt;, but in this case the subject became &lt;strong&gt;vaguer!&lt;/strong&gt; The more I read, the more confusing it all became: everyone seemed to be against the caste system (with a few exceptions) but no one seemed to know what it was! While each had very clear moral opinions on the subject, none had any clear understanding of what they were for/against. Consequently, my request: in your article, please (1) do not &lt;em&gt;assume&lt;/em&gt; that the caste system is an evil, but show that it is; (2) do not just say it is &lt;em&gt;obvious&lt;/em&gt;that it is a bane, but demonstrate it;  (3) do not &lt;em&gt;just affirm&lt;/em&gt; that ‘the dalits’ are victims of an immoral and unjust social organisation, but show how and why they are that. So far, I have not been able to prove any of the above claims &lt;em&gt;scientifically&lt;/em&gt; (or even unscientifically). Everyone seems to assume it, and the (literally) thousands of books and articles I have read on this score fail miserably in even saying what ‘the caste system’ is, leave alone &lt;em&gt;prove&lt;/em&gt; that it is the cause of many social and cultural ills in our culture and society. May I look forward to something that at least provides me with a semblance of a proof?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Translation or Random Substitution: Worship and Puja</title>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Firstly, you want to know whether there is anything intrinsically  wrong with performing idol worship the way it is with robbery.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let us assume that we agree we know what robbery is and that it is intrinsically wrong. We need to make these assumptions because (a) in all probability, the robbers do not see anything intrinsically wrong in the act of robbing; (b) even then, some of us might not be willing to call a &amp;lsquo;Robin hood&amp;rsquo; (who robs only the rich and passes on the spoils to the poor, retaining a modest &amp;lsquo;commission&amp;rsquo; for himself and fellow robbers) an immoral person; (c) to most of us, it is unclear whether the windfall profits that oil corporations have made in the last years constitute robbery or not and so on. Under these assumptions, you are drawing an analogy between idol worship and an act that a human being performs with respect to fellow-human beings. This analogy breaks down because idol worship is not a relation between human beings but between a particular act of a human being (called &amp;lsquo;worship&amp;rsquo;) and the entity worshipped.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;To help you think through the problem you &amp;ldquo;whether Christians can get enlightened&amp;rdquo;, try using this analogy. Something, let us call it ‘daffodil’, fascinates us. Let us also assume that a great deal of concern and interest is expressed about it. Consider two scenarios now, each of which testifies to our fascination.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first scenario is this. There is versification (call it ‘poetry’) and ‘embodiment’ (paintings and sculptures) of ‘daffodil’; imaginative eulogies (novels) and intimidating discourses (‘philosophy’) about ‘daffodil’ abound, etc. These classifications are based on our understanding of what art, poetry, philosophy etc. are. There are also many collations of fragmentary sentences that appear to violate metres of poetry or styles of prose. They are revered as revolutionary breakthroughs (made by the heroes of the ‘masses’ transgressing such elitist notions like ‘grammar’, ‘style’, etc.) that are ‘blinding in their beauty’. In short, there is a huge collection of material about ‘daffodil’.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

There is a reason for choosing this theme. Today, a few heathen cultures (for instance, those of India and China) have become important once again to the history of mankind. Irrespective of what else is said about the cultures of India or China, in the course of this millennium, these two are going to have a significant impact in the world. In the renewed meeting between India and China on the one hand and the western culture on the other, two issues are going to become central once again: (a) how they look at Christianity and Christian cultures and (b) how the western culture has learnt to look at them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/colonial-consciousness-and-enlightenment/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post will use an imagery as its organising thread, which tracks the search for enlightenment in terms of notions known to us from our secondary and higher education.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If we consider the search for happiness in these terms, then the ideas expressed &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/tattvadarshi-gyaani-and-bullshitter/&#34;&gt;there&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; could be reformulated thus: as human beings, almost all of us would like to be literates or would like to have a primary education. This is the move ‘away’ for unhappiness that all of us aim at, namely, to be ‘less unhappy’. After a period of time, many of us would like to move further. This is the move ‘towards’ (peace of mind, contentment, satisfied, etc.) happiness now formulated in positive terms: the phase of secondary education. The completion of this process is to reach a state of peace (shanti), or contentment (samadhana), or satisfaction (trupti) etc. The Sri Sri’s and the Sadguru’s of this world help us here through their Sudarshan Kriya’s, their yogic practices, their meditative courses and so on. The vipassana meditation, the Satsangh’s, the bhajans, the dhyaanas etc. are also situated here. Some people in this phase also call themselves Saadhakas, doing their ‘saadhana’ on a very regular basis.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Suppose that you want to go further and, therefore, seek higher education (call it Ananda, or happiness). There are two broad routes here: technical or vocational education is one route; university education is another. If you want to be plumber, a carpenter, a sculptor, a painter, a machinist…then you are better-off choosing technical education. However, you could also go for a university education. There is no ‘higher’ or ‘lower’ here; both are different forms of higher education. (Of course, there are endless discussions about ‘superiority’: one group disparagingly calls the other ‘vocational training’, while the other caricatures the first as ‘purely theoretical’ that is unsuited for fulfilling the ‘need’ for useful education or the ‘needs’ of society.) A society cannot survive without plumbers, electricians, machinists, artists, etc. Nor can it live without the ‘ivory tower’ that universities are and should be. Individual students make their choice based on multiple reasons (from aptitude to financial rewards) and many gifted teachers prefer to teach in vocational or professional schools than in a university. However, whatever the choice, both demand that the student specifies clearly what s/he wants to learn: do you want to be a sculptor or a machinist; in which subject do you want  your bachelor and Master’s degree? ‘Ananda’, the generic word, does not suffice here because it merely picks out ‘higher education’: do you want to do physics or chemistry or biology or English literature at the university? ‘Gyaana marga’ (the university) on the one hand and ‘other routes’ (vocational and professional training) on the other hand are the main avenues in higher education.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Within the framework of this imagery, ‘enlightenment’ refers to the total process of ‘higher education’ and ‘seeking ananda’ fixes the goal of higher education. Each avenue has its way of classifying its internal levels or divisions (Bachelors, Masters, Doctoral, Post-doctoral in the university, for example) and teaches students accordingly. They share many commonalities: the subject matter, the instruments, the theoretical frameworks, etc. etc. They are also different from each other in ways of teaching, investigating, making and reporting discoveries, and so on. The names of some teachers in higher education are known to us: Buddha, Shankara, Ramanuja, Madhva, Vallabha, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, Ramana, Nisargadatta Maharaj, etc. Let us not deal with the question whether they taught at the University or were active in professional or technical education because something else of greater importance has to be noticed: you have to choose the ‘subject’ of higher education first. ‘Seeking Happiness’ or ‘wanting enlightenment’ are not adequate at all. You need to specifiy what you are seeking and, preferably, why.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How would one translate the word &#39;God&#39; into, say, Sanskrit?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here is the question: How would one translate the word &amp;lsquo;God&amp;rsquo; into, say, Sanskrit? Now, the answer has to satisfy certain conditions because the question also meets certain conditions. Let me say very clearly what all these are, so that the playground and the rules are transparent and favour no one party in the dispute.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I propose we accept the best theory of meaning that exists in the market place. As far as I know, the book that plays this role most admirably, while satisfying the proponents of different theories of meaning expounded during the last century or so, is Prashant Parikh&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Language and Equilibrium&amp;rdquo; (The MIT press, 2010). His formal apparatus allows for the existence of &amp;lsquo;word meanings&amp;rsquo; without sacrificing the idea that the meaning of sentences are context-dependent and makes sense of even such statements as &amp;ldquo;the meaning of red light is&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; That is to say, it does not restrict &amp;lsquo;meaning&amp;rsquo; to words and sentences alone; it also allows us to deal with &amp;lsquo;word meaning&amp;rsquo; as well, as it is in our case. If my colleagues unanimously prefer another &amp;rsquo;theory of meaning&amp;rsquo;, I would like to know what it is. In all probability, I would not take issue with an alternate choice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This one begins to reflect about the principle of charity in relationship to the current US President, Donald Trump (from now on, Trump).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As you might know, the principle of charity has been formulated in different ways by different people. (Even the first page of a google search of the word ‘principle of charity’ allows you to access many of these documents quickly.) This post will stick strictly to your formulation: “a principle of charity says that (like the rain dance) a long-standing  practice should not be attributed to idiocy without strong evidence”. This formulation itself will not be questioned but assumed as a given. The only evidence used in this post is an extremely fragmentary viewing of the CNN and the BBC World coverages of Trump during the last week or so. (No thorough viewing of either of the two channels is claimed; the references in this post merely pick out fragments from programs as memory ‘recalls’ them today.) Two dramatis personae: Some media coverage and the event of Trump presidency; one question: what does the principle of charity do or advocate in the following cases? Such cases can be indefinitely multiplied but it is restricted here to five. One side of the argument is presented briefly only because that side of the argument is in wide circulation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Bullshit: True Sentences and Trivialization of Knowledge</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Why understanding bullshit is important?  Three reasons: (a) there is a very frequent use of the word ‘bullshit’ (mostly in my posts); (b) bullshit has been tied directly to truth in the literature on the subject, (c) far more important is the fact that it is much more connected to &lt;em&gt;knowledge&lt;/em&gt; than has so far been acknowledged. In this post, the focus is on the third reason.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, an ‘autobiographical’ point: I was charmed by how Akeel Bilgrami spoke about ‘bullshit’, when we met each other for the first time. Akeel also said that we call this ‘bakwas’ in Hindi. This resulted in revisiting &lt;a href=&#34;http://www2.csudh.edu/ccauthen/576f12/frankfurt__harry_-_on_bullshit.pdf&#34;&gt;Harry Frankfurt’s article on the issue&lt;/a&gt;; it further led to reading the late &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ditext.com/cohen/Cohen.pdf&#34;&gt;G.A. Cohen’s contribution on the topic&lt;/a&gt; and going through most of the literature on the subject. (Some interesting stuff on the theme is collected in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Bullshit-Philosophy-Guaranteed-Perfect-Results/dp/0812696115&#34;&gt;an edited volume&lt;/a&gt; on the subject that was published a few years ago.) Since then, some on and off thinking on the subject has been going on, some of whose results you shall notice in this post.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Proselytizing drive of the Eastern Christianity in India</title>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Actually, there are two questions that need to be distinguished from each other. There is, firstly, the question about the nature of &amp;lsquo;Eastern&amp;rsquo; Christianity. If it is muted in its proselytizing drive in all cultures the &lt;em&gt;same way&lt;/em&gt; and if it is &amp;rsquo;tolerant&amp;rsquo; in &lt;em&gt;exactly the same way&lt;/em&gt; in all cultures, it makes sense to ask the question whether (a) different factors in all these cultures have brought about the same effect (different &amp;lsquo;causes&amp;rsquo; can generate one and the same effect in differing circumstances) or (b) it is due to the nature of the &amp;lsquo;Eastern&amp;rsquo; Christianity itself. Nobody is able to make such a claim today. We do not possess the theoretical apparatus which would allow us to make sense of the remarks I have made in italics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Akrasia and Will</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/akrasia-and-will/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;To begin with, it is a matter of scholarly consensus among Classicists and philosophers that the concept of &amp;ldquo;Will&amp;rdquo; was absent from Greek thought and that St. Augustine was the first to develop it. Aristotle, for instance, had the notion of practical cognition and not &amp;lsquo;will&amp;rsquo;. &amp;ldquo;Akrasia&amp;rdquo; can only be loosely translated as &amp;ldquo;weakness of the will&amp;rdquo; simply because we do not quite know how to translate it otherwise.&#xA;X says: Isn&amp;rsquo;t that  basically a faculty of volition, something that is the first thing one learns to express in any language?&#xA;In so far as this sentence is about psychology, you do not have a clue either about its history or where it is today. In the Middle Ages in Europe, one spoke about a &amp;ldquo;faculty of Volition&amp;rdquo; as a part of human psychological makeup. Today, no psychologist (from any research programme) speaks in terms of &amp;ldquo;faculty psychology&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Is Worship a Human Invention?</title>
      <link>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/is-worship-a-human-invention/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 25 Jan 2017 01:20:48 +0530</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/is-worship-a-human-invention/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Let us assume that the Church Fathers (or the Apostles or whoever else) planned to introduce an eschatological doctrine and some mode of worship. (Let us further assume that their reasoning or their strategy was something analogous to your impressions: their intention was to induce a sense of urgency and guilt.) Our problem is not to explain their possible motives but to explain the &lt;em&gt;success&lt;/em&gt; of these strategies. Our questions are: why do all the Semitic religions (this reference to the Semitic religions is meant only keep the discussion simple) follow these strategies? Why are these strategies successful? (You can also go further and raise questions about their relative lack of success today in the western world, but we will ignore all such complications.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In the process of answering these questions, you will inevitably be forced to appeal to the nature of human psychology. This appeal will, in its turn, make assumptions about human psychology: such is human psychology that these strategies are successful. If this assumption is made, you face a very serious problem with the fact that these strategies do not seem to work with a lot of human beings (atheists, heathens &amp;hellip;). In other words, you cannot explain the success of this strategy by appealing to &lt;em&gt;human&lt;/em&gt; psychology. If you were to restrict it to the psychology of the believers &lt;em&gt;alone&lt;/em&gt;, you will end up providing &lt;strong&gt;a circular explanation&lt;/strong&gt;: such is the psychology of the believers that they are susceptible to this strategy. (Instead, you might as well say that the strategy works with &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt;people because it works with some people.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Suppose you take the following route: religion &amp;lsquo;works&amp;rsquo; only for those people who have a specific kind of psychology, you face the almost impossible task of providing some kind of empirical data across cultures and time. Further, you will also have to explain why people who were (and are) prone to guilt cease being believers. As though this is not enough, you will also have to explain why only &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; guilt-prone individuals become believers and some others do not. In short, this is an almost impossible exercise given our state of knowledge today.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;As though these problems are not enough, any psychological assumption will have to answer two other important questions.&#xA;4.1. One is the presence of a &lt;strong&gt;manifest denial&lt;/strong&gt; of these psychological assumptions in the theologies of these religions. Worship expresses your love for God. Even if the Apostles (or whoever else) was a scoundrel (and the greatest genius that mankind has ever known) who used this claim as a palliative, why do people continue to accept and believe in it? Again, you will be forced to invent another psychological explanation: the believers are mentally deficient (in some appropriate sense of the term), whereas non-believers are intelligent enough to see through the strategies. Needless to say, this is simply an &lt;strong&gt;ad hoc&lt;/strong&gt; explanation without any kind of warrant or plausibility.&#xA;4.2. The second question is about the fact that the believers genuinely love their God. One will have to deny this. One has to insist that the believers mistakenly identify their feelings of guilt with love. Needless to say, the explanatory task here is of mind-boggling complexity.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;There is a different kind of problem concealed in your difficulty, as soon as we realise that we need to explain the success of the strategies (to induce urgency and guilt). The intention of the apostles is not sufficient to guarantee its success: something called &amp;rsquo;the world&amp;rsquo; intervenes in between. It is not sufficient that I intend doing something to reach some goal in the world. I need to take the nature of the world into account as well, if I have to succeed. In short, the worry you express is a still-born child, if the goal is to understand what religion is.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt; Worship and eschatology (for instance) are not &lt;em&gt;necessary&lt;/em&gt; properties of an EI account. They are &lt;em&gt;contingent&lt;/em&gt;, i.e. given assumptions about our make-up, our capacities, and so on, we need to explain why all religions have such properties. In short, what I suggest is that, if we assume the existence of religion among human beings, all empirical religions will exhibit these properties. That is to say, if we come across a religion in some part of the earth that does not speak of worshipping God, does not have an eschatology, then my hypothesis is &lt;strong&gt;false&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;One final point. I am not saying that everything that happened in history is &lt;em&gt;necessary&lt;/em&gt;. What I do say is that given the structure of religion, some &lt;em&gt;kinds&lt;/em&gt; of events had to happen. All religions are &lt;em&gt;compelled&lt;/em&gt; to speak of worship, eschatology and so on.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;</description>

      <title>Truth vs Usefulness of Theories</title>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Speaking about the &amp;lsquo;use&amp;rsquo; or the &amp;lsquo;results and effects&amp;rsquo; of theories has a very venerable ancestry in the western philosophy. It is called &amp;ldquo;pragmatism&amp;rdquo;, if the &amp;rsquo;truth&amp;rsquo; is coupled to the &amp;lsquo;uses&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;results and effects&amp;rsquo;; it becomes &amp;ldquo;instrumentalism&amp;rdquo;, if the notion of truth is dispensed with. So, it might be useful if you were to familiarize with their arguments. (There is nothing specifically &amp;lsquo;Indian&amp;rsquo; with these claims, nor is there (of course) any need for there to be something.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Causality&amp;rdquo; is not a notion in physics but  comes from philosophy. Perhaps, you have forgotten that there existed (and exist) generations of scientists and philosophers of science who deny that &amp;ldquo;causality&amp;rdquo; has anything to do with sciences. Some argue this by suggesting that scientific theories do not describe the structure of the world but are merely useful instruments in prediction and control. These theories are not &amp;ldquo;useful&amp;rdquo; because they identify the causal forces in the world (and, hence,&amp;ldquo;true&amp;rdquo; in the semantic sense) anymore than the efficacy of the igloo proves that the Eskimo&amp;rsquo;s theory about the igloo is true.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/secularization-of-communitas/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Ancient Romans spoke of ‘Peoples’ and ‘Nations’. They saw traditions making a group into a people and distinguishing people (and, sometimes, ‘nations’) from each other. Different peoples (distinguished from each other on the basis of ancestral traditions) could live together in a nation and a nation itself could host multiple peoples and traditions. Consequently, they did not see Christians as a people because they did not have ancestral traditions to follow.&#xA;The Christians redefined what it is to be a people: they became a ‘communitas’ (a community) because of their ‘religio’. The Christians became a community because they were united “in God” and “in Christ”. They were united too in their “search for God”, which was what “conversio” (‘conversion’) meant to them. Christians were a ‘people’ now, a community that came into existence by their ‘unity in Christ’. The idea that individuals are “united” in “God and Christ” is what brings about a community and thus a people. This is a very Christian idea, which is based on the thought that individuals are united only in God. When secularized, it takes the shape of the idea that “a people” have a “common religion”. Or that every people is a people (or becomes one) because of religion.&#xA;I am working this idea out (every now and then) in my attempt to build a foundation for a theory of comparative politics, where I contrast these Christain ideas with the Indian ones.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Gettier Problem, Doxa, and Episteme</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Ancient (and modern) philosophers make the distinction between beliefs that are merely opinions of individuals and beliefs that are knowledge claims. Today, when modern philosophers speak of ‘doxastic coherence’ about the Greek thinkers, they do not merely mean that there should be a coherence in beliefs but also that Ancient philosophers have not produced knowledge but merely express opinions. Some also believe that all philosophy is mere ‘doxa’ but not ‘episteme’. The problem is this: what distinguishes a ‘doxastic’ sentence from an ‘epistemic’ sentence? One possibility was to say that ‘episteme’ was ‘justified true belief’ and not just a ‘mere belief’. This collapsed following the Gettier paradox which shows that this definition of ‘knowledge’ does not distinguish between mere opinion and knowledge. Today, one uses ‘doxastic coherence’ not as a technical term but as a judgement either about knowledge or about Greek thinkers or both or to signal that one thinks everything is an opinion. If one does not signal any of these, it is jargon.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Falsification</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Imagine I ‘hypothesize’ that I will win the lottery. If I buy a ticket and do not win, clearly my ‘hypothesis’ is ‘falsified’. Is it, therefore, scientific? Such silly hypotheses are dime a dozen. Do you think Popper was worried about this?&#xA;How to falsify my hypothesis. The answer is very simple: the way scientific theories can be falsified. I spell out some consequences of my hypothesis in Chapter 11. Even though there are more, if these ‘evidences’ as I call them there are untrue, my hypothesis stands refuted in its present form. You can also test the hypothesis by refuting other sub-hypotheses that are partially derived from the main hypothesis: like, the pagan relationship between ‘religio’ and ‘traditio’ that I postulate. If you can show that many, many authors from Antiquity deny my postulation and see ‘religion’ as that which binds all people together into one single community (for instance), my sub-hypothesis is severely damaged. Falsification is about the phenomena that a theory forbids from occurring; it has nothing to do with how to protect a theory from falsification. You cannot take a single conjecture and speak about its falsification: even according to Popper, theories are the basic units of falsification and not individual conjectures. To Lakatos and Laudan, the units are much bigger; to Quine, it is our entire web of beliefs, and so on. That is why I took the example of the Lottery ticket, which is an individual conjecture.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;About the relationship between scientific knowledge and enlightenment: If every human being can become enlightened (at any time, place or culture), it logically follows that some or another hypothesis about the world cannot be a requirement to become enlightened. People were enlightened (in the past) without possessing knowledge that humankind has today; one can become enlightened without being a physicist or a geneticist; one can believe in the existence of ghosts and spirits and still be enlightened… and so on. In the same way one can seek and find enlightenment while believing that human body is composed of five sheaths, one can also become enlightened by dismissing the idea of five sheaths as a false and primitive belief. There is, however, a caveat that ties knowledge to enlightenment. Perhaps, a contemporary example would help here.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Humility is a despicable vice</title>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Christianity (to some extent Judaism), presented an idea, unknown to the world in which it grew, namely the Pagan world of Rome. The idea was that human beings are creatures of God and that they belonged to His domain. He was the dominus or the Lord of the domain. As a result, human beings should not be arrogant, but must be humble instead. (As the ‘Book of Job’ in the Old Testament makes it clear, there is a very heavy price to be paid for arrogance.) Here, it belonged to the opposite spectrum in Ancient thought, which saw arrogance as a moral virtue and humility as a despicable vice. Protestant Christianity, especially Luther and Calvin, very forcefully propagated this idea: Man was a sinner, worse than the lowest worm, because of which God’s Grace becomes unfathomable and ungraspable.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/alleged-conflict-between-buddhism-and-brahmanism/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If the ‘I’ cannot be individuated or described, then there is no possible distinction between the ‘I’ and ‘the Brahman’. They are different names for ‘self-awareness’ which pick out the differential access that individuals have to ‘self-awareness’. Hence, the curious distinction that some Indian traditions make. On the one hand, the ‘I’ is alleged to be identical with the ‘Brahman’; on the other, the same traditions distinguish between ‘Atmagyaana’ and ‘Brahmagyaana’. These two ‘gyanaas’ can be two types of knowledge, if, on one reading, they are knowledge about two different objects, namely ‘atman’ and ‘Brahman’. If, however, they are identical, there could be only one knowledge. Second, even that is not possible. We can only have knowledge of something, if that something exists. If Atman or Brahman exist in this Universe, they are also subject to the processes that occur here. One such is decay and disintegration. Therefore, if we think this problem through, there is only one conclusion possible (if we assume that all Indians have not always been imbeciles): the gyaana is about the processes of accessing the real. It is not and cannot be about the real.&#xA;This means that the debate within the Indian traditions is not and could not have been about the nature of ‘atman’ or ‘Brahman’. Thus, the idea that is propagated as ‘the’ truth about the alleged conflict between the dvaita and the advaita is spurious and false. There was clearly debates and conflicts. But these cannot be about the nature of the real.&#xA;The same is true about the alleged conflict between ‘Buddhism’ and ‘Brahmanism’. Atman and Anatman are not conflicting doctrines about the real at all; they could not be. It is logically impossible that this was the debate between representatives of these traditions, unless we assume that Indians are congenitally incapable of thinking logically,. Those who sell this story, whether in India or abroad, the western savants and their Indian slaves, are the truly perfect imbeciles, which they actually think that Indians are. These idiots are our professors and many guru’s in India and elsewhere.&#xA;Thus, we see that Ambedkar and the Ambedkarites (in India and elsewhere today) are total slaves of their western masters. To ‘convert’ from ‘Hinduism’ to ‘Buddhism’, as though they are conflicting religions, is to simply ape the western cretins who have been selling this story for nearly 200 years. Of course, the Ambedkarites do that because their fame and fortune depends on slavery. They would rather be slaves of cretins than live free as thinking human beings. The western ‘thinkers’ in the US fete them because they love the adulation and adoration they get from these Indians. And, as is the case with Pollock, they are “friends with benefits” with Indians:  getting millions of dollars from idiots like Narayan Murthy and receiving national awards from the Indian government.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Is humility a virtue?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;First: there is nothing morally wrong in posting an opinion. My problem is that (a) it occurs within the context of generating and criticising knowledge; (b) its cognitive value is either zero or negative; (c) it is presented as though thoughtless opinions (almost all opinions are thoughtless) form a counterpoint to knowledge or are themselves candidates for knowledge (the latter are the hypotheses); (d) one acts as though the fact that opinions could have some moral value (because a human being expresses them) is sufficient to make them cognitively worthy; (e) cognitive nonsense is provided with a foundation in Christian (and Semitic) religious value (like ‘IMHO’, ‘humility’ for example), which is itself placed beyond discussion as though its importance is universally recognized; (Neither the Ancient Pagans nor the Asian traditions consider ‘humility’ a moral virtue. It is immoral to these traditions because it is seen as dissimulation and deception.); and so on. There is place on this forum for dissent, disagreement and criticism, but their foundation is not moral but cognitive. I do not tolerate opinions on this board, but I am willing to think about any hypothesis that appears reasonable. I will respond to misunderstandings, queries and criticisms. However, those who find my reactions (to their ‘humble opinions’) offensive should leave this group.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Coherence vs Consistenty</title>
      <link>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/coherence-vs-consistenty/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 13 Jan 2017 21:30:56 +0530</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/coherence-vs-consistenty/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;You say: “As far as I know, &amp;ldquo;doxastic coherence&amp;rdquo; means consistency in beliefs and that is all that is of relevance here.” It is not. Doxastic coherence is coherence between beliefs considered as opinions; its contrast set is “epistemic coherence” i.e., coherence between beliefs as knowledge claims. Further, in some senses, while there can be no coherence if there is no (logical) consistency between sentences within a particular theory, ‘coherence’ does not mean ‘consistency of beliefs’. One could have a coherent set of beliefs even if it comprises of mutually exclusive or even (logically) inconsistent subsets of beliefs. That is because (logical) ‘consistency’ is defined within a particular meta-logic, whereas ‘coherence’ applies to discourses. They do not, therefore, mean the same. One can have a coherent discourse, where multiple logics are used in different fragments of the same discourse. While some logics could allow material implication (or some other logical connective), other logics used within the same discourse might consider material implication an invalid rule of inference. This inconsistency (one and the same rule of inference is both valid and invalid) in two different fragments of a discourse does not make the discourse incoherent. In such a context, ‘doxastic coherence’ names a coherent discourse but does not pick out a (logically) consistent set of opinions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;No, I cannot explain the real; nor has anybody else in the world. Even more radically: the Real can never be ‘explained’, nor will there be an explanatory theory, ever (that is what is meant by ‘providing an explanation’ or speak of explaining) about the real.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well, if the ‘Real’ comprises of “all these doctrines” then the Real is the world of ideas as distinct from the material and the mental world. Popper believed this to be the case, and called it the ‘third world’. You are, therefore, right on the spot when you call me ignorant. Yes, indeed, I did not know that Indians were Popperians &lt;em&gt;avant la letter&lt;/em&gt;: avant la letter, because Popper did it with a clarity and verve that Indians never attained. This is the second reason I do not want to wake up. ‘Awakening’ of the type you propagate is terribly depressing because the resultant ‘gyaanodaya’ is this: Buddha, Shankara, Ramanuja, Madva (to mention only a few names) merely “prepared” the advent of Sir Karl Popper, in exactly the same way all cultures in the world before Christ were merely ‘Praeparatione Evangelica’. I wish you, who appears to be a disciple of this new ‘praeparatione’ (the famous ‘Second Coming’?), the best of luck.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Assumptions, Warrants, Hypotheses and Heuristics</title>
      <link>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/assumptions-warrants-hypotheses-heuristics/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 13 Jan 2017 21:13:27 +0530</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/assumptions-warrants-hypotheses-heuristics/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;You say: &amp;ldquo;there seems to be an underlying assumption that all participants in the thread seem to be making. The assumption being that all these texts have the same end goal in mind, and that this end goal is enlightenment/eudaimonia/happiness. I submit that such an assumption is unwarranted.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It is not an assumption but an explicit hypothesis, as far as I am concerned, that all the Indian traditions (not just these two sets of texts, namely, Upanishads and Puranas) are concerned with the same end goal. I want to provide a description of the Indian traditions as attempts to help human beings find happiness on earth. (For the time being, in order to avoid fruitless controversies and to have a point of departure, I take Aristotelian Eudaimonia to be an explication of this notion of happiness.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Assumptions often do require warrant, but hypotheses do not. Because the truth of a conclusion depends on the truth of the premise (often, assumptions function as premises in an argument) provided valid rules of inferences are used, it makes sense to ask for the warrant of an assumption. Needless to say, this condition does not hold for hypotheses: you have to evaluate them entirely differently.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Of course, in one sense, such a reconstruction would be the hypothesis I propose. Until such stage, the belief about the commonality of the goal of the Indian traditions would be an assumption. However, it is not a premise in a logical deduction but one which functions as a heuristic. Consequently, if I need to convince you to accept this assumption for the time being, I need to show you what is cognitively interesting about this assumption.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It promises to help explain the rivalry within the Indian traditions; it sheds new light on the inter-relationship between them in a different way than as &amp;lsquo;syncretism&amp;rsquo;; it helps one look for a set of problems underlying the Indian traditions; it allows one to formulate these problems in the twenty-first century language; it helps one evaluate the answers of these traditions and even carry them forward. These are some of the cognitive benefits of this assumption.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Of course, ultimately, it might turn out to be the case that no such goal is to be found and that the Indian traditions are not each other&amp;rsquo;s rivals. I do not know. For the time being, this idea appears very productive. That is enough of a warrant.&#xA;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you want to use &lt;strong&gt;Nirvana Shatkam&lt;/strong&gt;*,* it might be more productive to choose translations which do the job that the text can. Because of that, a ‘faithful’ translation of Sanskrit into English is not the primary requirement; the process and the goal should determine how the words are best understood. With this in mind, some suggestions regarding the translation of the Sanskrit verses.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is important to notice that the words in these verses refer to components (physical, physiological, psychological, etc.). Therefore, assume that human ‘mind’ (or human psychology) is referred to (or spoken of) in modular terms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The problem is more complicated and the implications far more massive than either of us can even dream of. In fact, I think we are not even aware of the nature, size and the dimensions of the problem(s) today. We do not even know whether we are dealing with something called the ‘translation’ problem or whole sets of other issues and problems that also redefine what it is to ‘translate’ texts between different cultures.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Between ignorance and deception: Satish Deshpande&#39;s idea of reservations</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Clearly, advocates of the caste-based reservation system are worried by the recent upheavals in Gujarat and beyond. In his &amp;ldquo;The Patidar idea of reservations&amp;rdquo; (&lt;em&gt;The Hindu&lt;/em&gt;, September 5), Delhi University sociologist Satish Deshpande attempts to ridicule the Patidars&amp;rsquo; demand for OBC status while expressing his support for the reservation system. In this piece, I do not wish to defend or attack any particular movement, such as that of the Patidars or the Gujjars, but merely draw attention to one simple point: Deshpande attempts to defend ignorance and immorality by drawing on arguments that exhibit the same properties.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Increasingly loud voices are to be heard from different capital cities in India about growing intolerance in Indian society. The western press picks up echoes and magnifies them, while ridiculing Modi’s visit to Great Britain. While one can understand that Indians chant mantras, why are Europeans reproducing them? Looking from the outside, this is a very puzzling phenomenon. Because it is unclear what exactly is at stake here, I’d like to raise some questions and reflect about them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Some found that we indulged in a personal attack, our piece lacked &amp;ldquo;logic&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;argumentation&amp;rdquo; and one of her secret admirers, in her defence, even sent us a link to a report by Saptadwipa Ghosal in &lt;em&gt;The Echo of India&lt;/em&gt;. Such responses demand an adequate reply. Actually, we wanted to show how profound her new education policy is and we failed in demonstrating it. In this piece, through the use of sophisticated hermeneutics, we shall make our mistake good.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;From the mouth of some babes, pearls of wisdom and truth fall like gentle rain from heaven. From the mouth of others, idiocies pour in a torrent and are considered truth only because they occupy positions of power. We leave it to the reader to decide to which group our minister of human resource development Smriti Irani belongs. Keep in mind that she determines to a large extent the course of education, including higher education policies in India. Irani&amp;rsquo;s comments on education at the conclusion of the National Seminar on the New Education Policy in Kolkata would be shocking if they were made by a mature and intelligent human being. But, as is said, from the mouth of the babes&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Questioning the axioms</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/questioning-the-axioms/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are three ideas in the West about Law that are taken as axioms. The first: all societies are founded on Law; if they are not, they ought to be. The second is that Law teaches and educates a people. Third is their corollary: only thus do a people become a Nation. As far as I know, none has shown their empirical truth or proved that they are logically necessary. But their truth-value is undisputed. When they ruled India, the British followed these axioms: they tried to educate us through Law, interfered in our festivals and social practices and the State tried to educate a barbaric people by enacting  ‘just’ laws. Romulus gave Law and made a group into a people; Moses gave Law and made a people into a Nation; Mohammed gave Law and transformed multiple nations into a caliphate; Manu acquires the exalted status of a Law-giver for the ‘Hindus’. These ideas are not dated, apparently. Today, they enjoy the same privilege they had during the colonial rule.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

But in such a way that &lt;em&gt;it becomes perverse&lt;/em&gt;. Because all the four issues are important, I would like to briefly talk about each.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;social science debate in India has been hijacked by the struggle between secularism and&lt;em&gt;Hindutva&lt;/em&gt; for decades now. usually the &lt;em&gt;Sangh Parivar&lt;/em&gt; is blamed for this turn of events. However, it could well be argued that the &lt;em&gt;Hindutva&lt;/em&gt; ideologues simply adopted the stance of the secularists.  Perhaps the best illustration is the case of anti-Brahminism.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To be against &amp;ldquo;Brahminism&amp;rdquo; is part and parcel of the political correctness of progressive scholars in twenty-first-century India, much like being against Muslims is part of the message of their &lt;em&gt;Hindutva&lt;/em&gt; colleagues. This indicates that something is very wrong with the Indian academic debate. Promotion of animosity towards a religious tradition or its followers is not acceptable today, but it becomes truly perverse when the intelligentsia endorses it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This has been a tumultuous decade for the academic study of India. In his recent &lt;em&gt;Offence: The Hindu Case&lt;/em&gt; (2009), Salil Tripathi provides a timely overview of the growing censorship and harassment that scholars working on India have faced. Not a pretty sight to behold: people have felt the need to ban books and terrorize authors, hassle teachers and disrupt classes, toss eggs at some and blacken others’ faces. Academics now run the risk of smear campaigns, court cases and physical intimidation; all because certain groups feel offended by what they write about the Indian past or the Hindu traditions. The facts are difficult to miss. Hence, the threat that Hindu nationalism poses to academic freedom has caused commotion around the world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;i&#34;&gt;I&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;When I took the &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/what-can-india-offer/&#34;&gt;caste-system as an example&lt;/a&gt;, what am I doing? I am showing that turning the standard story on its head is a child&amp;rsquo;s play: caste has been said to be an antiquated, rigid,  dogmatic, etc social structure, which is &amp;ldquo;very difficult&amp;rdquo; to eradicate. If this is true, most of the rantings  seem to subscribe to this text book story, then this can be put on its head very easily. A word of warning, therefore, to those who ramble on about the &amp;lsquo;immoral&amp;rsquo; caste system: take heed! You do not know what you are talking about.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The issue is not about whether there is poverty and injustice in India. Instead, it is about wanting to correlate these with the caste system. To do this, all one has to show is that poverty and injustice in India is the causal result of the caste system in India, whereas, in other countries of the world, they are the results of &amp;lsquo;something else&amp;rsquo;. No one in the world has been able to show this; if some among you have proof to the contrary, kindly demonstrate. Indulging in shouting matches is easier than arguing reasonably.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, India has become a global player of significant political and economical impact. Europe and India are facing each other as equal partners in pursuit of greater economic and political co-operation. This confronts both India and Europe with a challenge. The intelligentsia, the business world, politicians, educators and others, will have to answer the following question: What can India offer to the world of today and tomorrow?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I will not tackle this problem directly but instead take up one of its sub-questions: to whom is this problem important and why? I believe it is important to both Indians and Europeans but for different reasons. In this article, I will spell out and reflect upon some of these reasons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

In the last four decades of living in Europe, I have heard both sides of the debate. As an Indian living abroad, it appears to me that these debates actually raise one single question: Are Indians irrational or immoral, or both? This is the un-debated side of the reservation discourse in India. Let me explain. Is caste-based reservation a rational policy to follow? The answer to this question does not require a definition of ‘rationality.’ Instead, the issue is: does this policy eventuate in irrational consequences or effects?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The relation between religion and politics remains one of the important issues of our time. The discussions on this relation swing between two extremes: religious fundamentalism and liberal secularism. These are regarded as opposites. As the liberal perspective sees it, the secular state and its principles of neutrality and toleration are antidotes to religious fundamentalism[1]. Recently, this view has been challenged. Several authors point out that fundamentalism and secularism are not self-contained opposites, but are intertwined in significant ways[2].&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The annual reports of the US Commission for International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) have long irked politicians and citizens from countries placed on its ‘watch list’. This is no different in India. In the 2015 report released about a fortnight ago, the country again occupies an unenviable spot in Tier 2, which includes countries where the religious freedom violations engaged in or tolerated by the government are serious.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Striking about this year’s report, however, is its claim that incidents of religiously-motivated and communal violence have ‘reportedly’ increased for three consecutive years in India. “According to Muslim and Christian NGOs that track communal incidents,” it adds, “2014 statistics, yet to be released by the ministry, will be likely higher” than the 823 incidents recorded in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rape of a Country&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Jakob De Roover&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt; Imagine. A filmmaker travels to Belgium because she has heard about the pedophilia scandals in the country. She directs a documentary film including an interview with an infamous pedophile, who says that the girls he raped had actually seduced him and that they really enjoyed it. The filmmaker then comments that Belgian society is responsible for creating such pedophiles by teaching them what to think. Most men in this country are programmed in this way, she insists. In fact, this is all part of a larger disease and culture, which is also reflected in Belgian cinema. How would we Belgians react? We would find this shocking and infuriating. It is as though pedophilia is an expression of the core of our culture, as though we are programmed for child abuse.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Secular theme: cognitive stages of development -- concrete vs abstract</title>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The religious idea I am talking about in chapter 3 is this: Concrete and abstract characterize human thinking in the different phases of its development. By the time we reach chapter 7, and start thinking in terms of &amp;lsquo;secularization’, I will be talking about secularizing religious themes with respect to the same.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt; Neither the words ‘concrete’ or ‘abstract’, nor the concepts associated with them are &amp;lsquo;religious’. (In this sense, concepts are neither &amp;lsquo;religious’ nor &amp;lsquo;scientific’.) The same applies to the use of words ‘concrete thought’ and &amp;lsquo;abstract thought’ (or to their meaning). But what is religious is the above idea, which speaks of different stages of human cognitive growth in terms of &amp;lsquo;concrete’ and ‘abstract thought’.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Magic of ‘Radicalization’?</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/the-magic-of-radicalization/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;After the Paris attacks came the questions: Is this violence caused by Islam or unrelated to religion? Are the perpetrators believers or madmen? Do they represent the extremists that we find in any ideology?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The responses were diverse: ‘Islam is a threat to free speech’. But many Muslims joined the protest marches in defence of the freedom of expression. ‘Not all Muslims are terrorists, but most terrorists are Muslims’. The statistics show otherwise. ‘Madmen have neither colour nor religion’. Yet the ‘professionals’ in Paris screamed ‘Allahu Akbar’.  And then appeared the magical word ‘radicalization’. From the mayor to the teacher, from the politician to the policeman, everyone now knows what the problem is and where we should look for solutions: strict measures against ‘radicalized Muslims’ and ‘deradicalization programmes’ developed by ‘radicalization experts’.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Caste Sytem III</title>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I have said before, my &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/caste-system-i/&#34;&gt;hypothesis&lt;/a&gt; is meant to guide the research and, as such, suggests that we find that the Brahmins will exhibit more of a heterarchical organization than a hierarchical one. Let us assume that what you say is true. In that case, this anomaly (or these anomalies) will become the problem(s) that my hypothesis has to solve. That is, the hypothesis will force one to look for an explanation in multiple directions: for instance, have these hierarchies emerged due to induction of new groups and individuals in the course of history? (That means, this hypothesis forces one to probe the truth of the statement that once one is born into a jati, there is no way of moving to another Jati. The Madhva conversion in South India has disproved it but no one I know has taken this fact into consideration.) Who were the majority jati&amp;rsquo;s in the area and what was the nature of interaction between these Brahmin groups and other Jati&amp;rsquo;s? And so on. In other words, each anomaly we confront forces further research. There is always the possibility that my research hypothesis will crumble under the weight of accumulated anomalies but that is not the case yet. At the moment, they merely call for further research.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Two small points before I respond to your questions. One: all I have is &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/caste-system-i/&#34;&gt;a hypothesis&lt;/a&gt; that can guide research. In itself, it is not a theory and I cannot hope to convince anyone (at this stage) that this hypothesis is true. It requires years of research (of different kinds) before it can be made compelling. Therefore, please know that I understand your skepticism and find it only natural. Two: However, I will give you some indications about why I find the hypothesis interesting and worthy of further research. I will choose some examples at random to indicate the kind of problems that this hypothesis promises to solve.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You ask whether &amp;ldquo;there is a perception of caste hierarchies among Brahmins&amp;rdquo;. My guess is that there is no such general perception, even if, regionally, multiple Brahmin jati&amp;rsquo;s fight for superiority. There is no way to establish, say, that the &amp;lsquo;Babburkamme&amp;rsquo; is superior to &amp;lsquo;Havyaka&amp;rsquo; in Karnataka. In fact, many from either of the two would not even know of the existence of the other. In Bangalore itself, for instance, where the former is preponderant, I did not even know of their existence until I was 15 years old. In this sense, even in areas where they might claim to &amp;lsquo;superiority&amp;rsquo;, it is difficult to establish hierarchies among the Brahmins in any one region. This, as I say, is my guess.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let me reconsider the hypothesis I propose: what we call &amp;rsquo;the caste system&amp;rsquo; in India today is a hybrid beast. It is not a social structure but a linguistic entity (i.e., a set of sentences) which is an incoherent admixture to two unconnected descriptions (of the world): a generalization of the description of a structured set of interactions (let us leave aside the question of what kind of mathematical properties that this &amp;lsquo;structured set&amp;rsquo; has: how it is ordered, whether the ordering is strong or weak and so on) among &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/caste-hierarchies/&#34;&gt;the so-called &amp;rsquo;lower castes&amp;rsquo;&lt;/a&gt;, while fitting this description within the framework of the varna system, which, I say, is a description of social stratification at a very high level of abstraction or generality. It is incoherent by virtue of its claim to being a &amp;lsquo;unified&amp;rsquo; (and unifying) description of the social structure of Indian society: it collapses descriptions of different things at different levels (of descriptions) into a single alleged description of social reality. That is why these &amp;rsquo;theories&amp;rsquo; of caste are either incoherent, nonsensical or, where neither, false.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Defininition vs hypothesis: religion</title>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One confuses between a definition and a hypothesis. Definitions tell us how we use a word and which objects it refers to. In the case of the term ‘religion’, a definition should merely address this referential task: which things are we referring to, when we use this word. It cannot give us any understanding of the structure or properties of religion and does not have empirical consequences (much as defining any other word, say ‘species’ or ‘psychosis’, does not have empirical consequences). It merely points out the phenomena that are to be theorized. The result of this second process of theorizing is a hypothesis, which characterizes the properties or structure of a phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Assume that you get a Ph.D student who wants to do medical research. He comes to you and tells you that he wants to find out an answer to the burning question about why people get sick. Would you be able to guide this student in answering his question or give one answer to it? Your answer would be: it depends. You would also further say to him, ‘choose a particular disease, choose a particular domain and choose a particular approach within that domain, if you want to do research’. There is no ‘one answer’ to his question. As a research question, you would say it is ill-formed: you have to specify the disease, and choose whether you want to do, say, genetic research or epidemiological research or cell research or…&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The discussion about re-accessing the vibrancy of the Indian culture and the question whether or not to legislate against conversion, are best treated separately. An answer to the latter does not necessarily count as an answer to the first. In fact, the tendency to counter the proselytising drive of Christianity and Islam by voting laws against conversion is itself an &lt;em&gt;indication&lt;/em&gt; of India’s cultural weakness. Hence, it cannot be a means to re-kindle the flame of India’s pluralistic tradition. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most of us would not know the difference between the Syrian Orthodox, the Greek Orthodox and the Russian Orthodox Churches; many will be hard put to differentiate between the Pope and the Patriarch. In these circumstances, it is foolish to write &lt;em&gt;apologetica&lt;/em&gt; for &amp;lsquo;Eastern Christianity&amp;rsquo; and criticise &amp;lsquo;Western Christianity&amp;rsquo;. Let those concerned with the nature of Christian theologies do that. But that does not concern us.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Rajiv, regarding your #82 (from Sulekha board). The Emperor Constantine &lt;strong&gt;did not&lt;/strong&gt; start a trend. &lt;em&gt;UrChristenthum&lt;/em&gt; was as viciously proselytizing as the most rabid Protestant of today. Before one addresses oneself to the role that &amp;lsquo;power&amp;rsquo; played in the proselytizing drive of Christianity, one needs to know what &lt;em&gt;proselytization&lt;/em&gt; means. Consider the role that the Emperors played in Rome (and the role played by some Kings in India.) They would promote some or another tradition (or &amp;lsquo;cult&amp;rsquo;, as they were called in the Roman Empire), &lt;em&gt;persecute the followers&lt;/em&gt; of some or another tradition (or cult). &lt;strong&gt;Does that mean that the cults proselytized too, or that they were as &amp;lsquo;intolerant&amp;rsquo; as the Semitic religions?&lt;/strong&gt; To affirm either of the two is to lose any ability to understand the difference between Indian traditions (or the Roman cults) and the Semitic religions. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Is wearing a bindi religious?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Depending on the context of the discussion (say a dispute about some aspect of the Indian culture), the disputants can treat wearing the bindi or a saree as facts. However, in another context of the discussion, these facts might become theoretical claims. For instance, is the Indian woman wearing a bindi or an Indian male wearing kumkum on his forehead being religious or not? Consider, for instance, the recent French legislation about wearing religious &amp;lsquo;symbols&amp;rsquo; in the public. If someone decides to take an Indian to the court, then wearing bindi or kumkum becomes an issue of dispute. Then we will have disputes: one side will claim that it is religious, and the other will probably want to say that it is not religious. (If it happens, I suggest they use &amp;lsquo;The Heathen in His Blindness: Asia, the West and the dynamic of religion&amp;rsquo;!) In such a case, wearing a bindi will be described using two kinds of theories about wearing a bindi.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is, on the one hand, the intellectual tradition of expressing opinions and points of view. Here, as it suits thoughtful minds, one tries to express ideas carefully and in a nuanced fashion. Recent peer-opinions are taken into account; generalizations are avoided; the attention is on the specific and the concrete; and, where possible, one’s ideas are either founded upon or embroidered by some or another of the many philosophical stances that are available. The goal of the discussion is to endorse these opinions, or express disagreement on the broad idea expressed by the author. Any other kind of intellectual exercise of often seen as either nit-picking or engaging in polemics. To those who have grown up in this culture, it is obvious what the sought-after intellectual virtues are and how one should cultivate it. In other words, this culture surrounds itself with meta-arguments that is either founded upon or embroidered by some or another meta-philosophy about what intellectuals are, what their role in the realm of ideas should be and how they should relate to the rest of society.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is a very interesting notion of &amp;ldquo;critique&amp;rdquo;: it begins with Kant and stretches through Marx in the German philosophical tradition. In fact, it is most developed in Marx when he says he develops a &amp;ldquo;critique&amp;rdquo; of the &amp;ldquo;science&amp;rdquo; of political economy, a &amp;ldquo;critique&amp;rdquo;, which, he says, is nonetheless a &amp;ldquo;science&amp;rdquo;. He does not develop a &amp;ldquo;scientific critique&amp;rdquo; of political economy: he develops a critique of the science of political economy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You claim that Jesus of Nazareth is a mystic. From the conversations so far, I presume that this is both your gut-feeling and conviction. The one deriving from your own mystical experience and the other because you find that mysticism, qua experience, does not distinguish between people on the basis of their color, creed, culture and country. I am perfectly willing to bow to authentic experience, but convictions? They need arguments and evidence, even if it is a subject as thorny as mystical experience. However, I will not ask you for your evidence but will try to present &lt;em&gt;counter-evidence&lt;/em&gt; to your conviction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I would like to address a very basic issue that many of us have confronted. In its simplest form, the question is this: What should we, a small slice of the Indian intelligentsia, be doing? We can vent our anger and frustration at the way the Indian politicians are handling (or mishandling) the Kashmiri situation; we can express hurt and outrage that &amp;lsquo;Hindus&amp;rsquo; are singled out for special treatment both by the &amp;rsquo;liberals&amp;rsquo; and by a section of the Muslim population; we can propose a trifurcation of Kashmir; or that the Muslims be &amp;rsquo;taught&amp;rsquo; a lesson (whatever that lesson consists of); indulge in abuse and name-calling; or whatever else that takes our fancy at any particular moment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;According to Judaism, Christianity and Islam, &amp;lsquo;Hinduism&amp;rsquo; is devil&amp;rsquo;s worship. Instead of quoting from their scriptures, let me give the barest of the bare outlines of their fundamental story about &amp;lsquo;God&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;religion&amp;rsquo;. No&lt;em&gt;believer&lt;/em&gt;from any of these religions (their religious authorities included) could ever disagree with this outline. There are two &amp;lsquo;Gods&amp;rsquo;: the true God and the false God (notice the capitalization). The first created the world and everything in it; the second, who is his creature too, is the &amp;lsquo;fallen&amp;rsquo; one. (Why he fell, what his &amp;lsquo;sin&amp;rsquo; was, etc. are glossed differently by these three religions.) The devil has &lt;em&gt;many names&lt;/em&gt; (Baal, Beelzebub, Satan, Lucifer, Mephistopheles, &amp;hellip;) and his followers are &amp;ldquo;legion&amp;rdquo;. This devil is the lord of the earth, the prince of darkness, the father of lies, the king of deceit, etc. the devil is the &amp;lsquo;false god&amp;rsquo;, i.e., he constantly seduces mankind into worshipping him as though he was God himself. To worship the devil is to go to hell for eternity; the road to salvation (please, do not confuse this with mukthi or moksha) lies in worshipping the true God. However, how to know who is the true God so that one may worship him? What does it mean to &amp;lsquo;worship&amp;rsquo; him? (After all, so their story goes, the false God also parades as &amp;lsquo;God&amp;rsquo; and deceives the humankind.) Hence, God &lt;em&gt;reveals&lt;/em&gt; himself (again, please do not confuse this with avataaras.), and tells that he is the true God and how humankind &lt;em&gt;ought&lt;/em&gt; to worship him. (&amp;lsquo;religion&amp;rsquo;, as they see it, is the worship of God.) This &lt;em&gt;revelation&lt;/em&gt; is what their scriptures are about. According to these revelations, God has commanded not to &lt;em&gt;build his likeness&lt;/em&gt; (i.e. create idols); to worship the idols is to worship the devil. This true God is one; the false &amp;lsquo;gods&amp;rsquo; are many (the devil&amp;rsquo;s &amp;rsquo;legion&amp;rsquo;); he has one name (Yahweh written without the consonants in Hebrew; the Holy Trinity in Christianity; the merciful Allah in Islam); the devil has &lt;em&gt;many names&lt;/em&gt;. (&lt;em&gt;Do not confuse names with the hundred and odd properties of God that Koran talks about.&lt;/em&gt; Now, these and more are God&amp;rsquo;s revelations in these three religions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Religious Intolerance and Believers</title>

      <pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2014 21:15:50 +0530</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/believers-vs-their-religion/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are two distinct problems: one involving religions (like Christianity, Judaism and Islam) and the other involving the believers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Regarding these three religions: (a) insofar as these religions (Judaism, Christianity and Islam) are concerned, Hinduism is demonic. It is that because, according to all the three religions, &amp;lsquo;Hindus&amp;rsquo; worship the devil (&amp;lsquo;shaitan&amp;rsquo;) and his minions. That is to say, our Rama, Vishnu, Ganesha, Saraswathi, etc. are all lieutenants of the devil himself. The idols, according to their theology, are representations of the devil, and Pat Robertson is simply echoing this standard Christian (Judaic, and Islamic) doctrines. There is nothing &amp;rsquo;extremist&amp;rsquo; about this statement: it is, as I say, one of the basic claims of these three religions. Because we worship the devil, they are convinced, we will all go to hell (do not confuse this with our naraka) for eternity. Because they want to save souls, these religions want to convert others into &amp;lsquo;believers&amp;rsquo;. (By the way, the &amp;lsquo;jealous&amp;rsquo; God is God of the Jews - God of Israel - in one of the more known aspects from the Old Testament Bible. In the New Testament, God is supposed to be &amp;rsquo;loving&amp;rsquo;. If you want to irk a Jew just tell him that his God is jealous and punishing, whereas God of Christianity is loving.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Devil worship in &#39;Hinduism&#39;</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here goes: that &amp;lsquo;Hindu&amp;rsquo; religion is devil&amp;rsquo;s worship is central, crucial and vital to the religions that Judaism, Christianity and Islam are. &amp;lsquo;Why is that?&amp;rsquo;, you may ask. It is impossible to cover this question in the space of a post, and with the details the question demands. So, here is what can be done: (a) I will provide a very crude outline with respect to Christianity; (b) reread what &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/belief-vs-faith/&#34;&gt;I wrote about God and devil .&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Belief vs Faith</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/belief-vs-faith/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;(a) It appears to me that in these discussions, a very vital issue (if we want to talk about Judaism, Christianity and Islam, and their &amp;lsquo;problems&amp;rsquo; with &amp;lsquo;Hinduism&amp;rsquo;, etc) is not being recognized. and that is this: religious &amp;lsquo;beliefs&amp;rsquo; are not accorded their place, and are talked about as though they are merely a subset of the class of &amp;lsquo;beliefs&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(b) &amp;lsquo;Being a believer&amp;rsquo; (I will confine myself to Christianity for the sake of brevity) does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; mean assenting to the proposition that &amp;lsquo;God exists&amp;rsquo;. For, if this is what it would mean, then the Devil himself is the first believer: after all, he does accept it as true that God exists. (The Devil is not an atheist, mind you.) He knows that God exists: after all, he rebelled against him! As the new testament Bible puts it: &amp;ldquo;thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble.&amp;rdquo; (James 2: 26)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In so far as one sees &lt;a href=&#34;http://creative.sulekha.com/the-axis-of-neocolonialism_103313_blog&#34;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; as a beginning of a certain type of enquiry, it is excellent. However, it is not adequate as a formulation of either the problem that confronts the Indian intellectuals (and not merely them) or the solutions. The problems are far more complex and the task is far more daunting than they appear at first sight.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What may not be forgotten, if one wants to be relevant and rational at all, is that we live in a world which has not merely included colonialisms but also our responses to them. Our generation is molded (mostly) by a colonial past that has basically been accessed only through its critique: whether nationalist, Marxist or Orientalist. Consequently, our questions, problems and misgivings are not those of a generation or two ago.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Westology and its nonsense</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/westology-and-its-nonsense/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;What is the logic of &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/why-study-the-western-culture/&#34;&gt;my argument&lt;/a&gt;? Am I proposing a &amp;lsquo;westology&amp;rsquo;? Let me briefly explicate my stances, beginning with the last question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If we are not to simply sell slogans and our claims should carry bite, we need to say what this &amp;lsquo;westology&amp;rsquo; is or could be. My stance: such a &amp;lsquo;westology&amp;rsquo; cannot even be properly conceptualized, let alone carried out.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1.1. What does it mean (however intuitively plausible it might appear at first sight) to build a &amp;lsquo;westology&amp;rsquo; that is, say, an Indian counterpart to &amp;lsquo;indology&amp;rsquo;? Are we to assume that we need to build &lt;em&gt;Indian&lt;/em&gt; theories of &amp;lsquo;democracy&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;state&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;market&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;firm&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;society&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;religion&amp;rsquo; and such like? If the answer is &amp;rsquo;no&amp;rsquo;, then the notion of &amp;lsquo;westology&amp;rsquo; does not make sense. Therefore, the answer has to be &amp;lsquo;yes&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why study the Western culture?</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/why-study-the-western-culture/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Two substantial questions have been raised in response to &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/vacuity-of-intellectual-svaraj/&#34;&gt;what I wrote&lt;/a&gt;: (a) why do we need to study and understand the Western culture in order to access our own traditions? (b) Is it my claim that Buddha and Shankara (for example) are irrelevant to us? One other sort of &amp;lsquo;objection&amp;rsquo; too has surfaced, albeit disguised as a characterization of what I have said: (c) is not my position itself illustrative of &amp;lsquo;Eurocentrism&amp;rsquo;? These issues are intertwined.  Hopefully, addressing them together will lend some clarity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Intercultural exchange of categories</title>
      <link>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/intercultural-exchange-of-categories/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/intercultural-exchange-of-categories/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;What is wrong with the intercultural exchange of categories? Throughout one gets the impression that there is something “fundamentally wrong” with categories shifting in meaning over time or with the introduction of categories from one culture into another culture. But what is important about these shifts in meaning? What exactly is the problem in introducing the category of religion into India or among Native Americans? The category “yuppie” did not exist in the Middle Ages, while “orange” came through Arabic from Sanskrit, and “girl” used to refer to a young person of either sex. When we analyse the genetics of early modern populations, we are also introducing categories that they did not possess. Or take the word “silly,” which in Old English used to mean blessed. So what? An historical analysis of discourse and categories is significant not to identify shifts in meaning per se. Shifts in meaning become significant only against the background of a theory on the historical development of the western culture and its understanding of other cultures. Such a theory is needed to clarify as to why a shift in the meaning of “religion” or “the secular” is of crucial importance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Colonial Consciousness: M.N. Srinivas and Sanskritization</title>
      <link>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/colonial-consciousness-m-n-srinivas-and-sanskritization/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 03 Apr 2013 04:25:34 +0530</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/colonial-consciousness-m-n-srinivas-and-sanskritization/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;M. N. Srinivas (MNS) claims that &amp;ldquo;a caste was able, in a generation or two, to rise to a higher position in the hierarchy by adopting vegetarianism and teetotalism and by changing its rituals and deities.&amp;rdquo; The first basic problem here is how one can establish the position of a jati in the supposed hierarchy and measure it in such detail that one can see over two generations that the jati has attained a higher position. Which standard does one use to establish the position of jati x? What members of jati x say about its position relative to other jatis? What members of other jatis say about the position of x relative to their own jatis? As our fieldwork in Karnataka has already shown, it is impossible to infer any hierarchy from such empirical data, because all one gets is a series of inconsistent statements with regard to the relative positions of jatis. This basic problem becomes even more intractable when we take into account the history of assigning positions to jatis in the so-called &amp;ldquo;caste hierarchy&amp;rdquo;. When the British had their caste census in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, many jatis classified as shudras or untouchables sent in petitions arguing that they held higher positions; they were kshatriyas, they said. Today, the same jatis insist that they are really shudras or untouchables and should be classified as OBCs or SCs. When jatis can radically revise their &amp;lsquo;position in the hierarchy&amp;rsquo; according to the status or benefits they win by doing so, what could one ever conclude about their position and how it changes over generations?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Should one calculate the average socio-economic level of jati x and compare it to the average level of other jatis? Apart from difficulties in calculating this socio-economic level, one faces an even more difficult problem: how does one circumscribe jati x? Are two groups with the same name both sub-divisions of jati x? What if they claim they are different jatis? What geographical or social unit should one begin with to establish the (socio-economic) position of jati x in the hierarchy? Let us say one takes the village as the relevant unit. How does the socio-economic level that jati x enjoys in some village tell us anything about its position in the hierarchy? If the socio-economic welfare of jati x increases markedly over two generations in this village, does this mean it has attained a higher position? What if the same jati in the surrounding villages has declined? In terms of empirical data, then, it becomes impossible to say (a) what the position is of a jati in the supposed hierarchy and (b) when it has attained a higher position. In other words, MNS can never have inferred his conclusions about Sanskritization and castes rising to higher positions from his &amp;lsquo;fieldwork data&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Secular State and Religious Conflict: Liberal Neutrality and the Indian Case of Pluralism</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editor&amp;rsquo;s Note: This article appeared in the Journal of Political Philosophy. Authored by SN Balagangadhara and Jakob De Roover. For an alternative research programme (paradigm)  for studying India, Indian culture and Indian culture, study Balagangadhara&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;Reconceptualizing Indian Studies&lt;/strong&gt;, published by OUP, India.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are few places in the contemporary world where the problems of cultural pluralism are as acute as they are in India. The Indian case poses fundamental challenges to the political theory of toleration. By tackling the problem of religious conversion, our analysis shows that the dominant way of conceiving state neutrality becomes untenable in the Indian context. The Indian state, modelled after the liberal democracies in the West, is the harbinger of religious conflict in India because of its conception of toleration and state neutrality. More of &amp;lsquo;secularism&amp;rsquo; in India will end up feeding what it fights: the so-called &amp;lsquo;Hindu fundamentalism&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editor&amp;rsquo;s note: This article appeared in the Journal of American Academy of Religion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The paper attempts a contrast between the process and the structure of the Christian and the Indian spirituality. Drawing attention to their dissimilarities, it attempts to reformulate the differences among the Indian traditions in a novel way. It argues that cultures and traditions are not just different; but that they differ from each other in different ways as well. The future of religious studies, it is suggested, is dependent on developing the ability to develop new ways of describing the differences between cultures and traditions. This is the agenda for the future. As a correlate to this task, the paper suggests that we replace the question &amp;ldquo;who speaks &amp;lsquo;for&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;about&amp;rsquo; a religion?&amp;rdquo; with a more pregnant and a more accurate reformulation: &amp;ldquo;how to speak for a religion in the Academy?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How do we understand the concept of Communal Violence?</title>
      <link>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/how-do-we-understand-the-concept-of-communal-violence/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We all agree that events like the Gujarat riots are tragic and terrible. But what is the role of intellectuals in avoiding similar tragedies in the future?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why can’t religion be political?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Obviously, the duty of the intellectual is to try and help us understand the nature of the events and the violence involved. In India and abroad, the concepts of ‘communalism’ and ‘communal violence’ are often used to analyse these riots. These tell us that the main cause behind the Hindu-Muslim conflicts in India is the use of religion for political ends. It is often added that religion itself is not responsible for the riots, but rather its misuse by power-hungry clerics and politicians. The harm of communalism lies in its mixing of political aims and religious identities, which is taken to cause violence. Let us have a closer look at this concept of communal violence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Neurobiological Theory of Religion</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/neuro-biological-theory-of-religion/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;You ask whether &amp;lsquo;in principle&amp;rsquo; a neurobiological theory on religion could &amp;ldquo;account&amp;rdquo; for the experience of the believers. The answer depends on what kind of an account you are asking for and what you have in mind when you say &amp;lsquo;in principle&amp;rsquo;. If you mean by &amp;lsquo;account&amp;rsquo;, whether it could predict or even explain, I do not think so. We know that, at the least, we are made up of atoms. Your question, in terms of the kind of challenge it poses (even though the degree of complexity changes), is identical to the question: could a theory in physics, in principle, ever account for our experiences? What does &amp;lsquo;in principle&amp;rsquo; mean here actually? There was a period when one thought, among other things, that it was possible &amp;lsquo;in principle&amp;rsquo; to describe mathematics in a purely logical language. That is, many thought that mathematics has a &amp;ldquo;logical structure&amp;rdquo; and that, therefore, one could reconstruct mathematics aided by a suitably powerful logic. (It is called the &amp;lsquo;Hilbert program&amp;rsquo;, named after the originator of this research program.) Then a mathematician called Kurt Gödel proved that, in principle, we cannot even prove the truth of elementary arithmetic on logical grounds: even though we can generate true statements in elementary arithmetic (and know that they are true; they are called &amp;ldquo;Gödel numbers&amp;rdquo;), we cannot prove their truth. Nor can we prove their falsity. They belong to the class of &amp;ldquo;undecidable&amp;rdquo; statements. In other words, what appears obvious to many of us today, namely, arithmetic is &amp;rsquo;logical&amp;rsquo; in nature cannot ever be &amp;ldquo;proved&amp;rdquo;. This is an impossibility theorem that Gödel proved in the 1930&amp;rsquo;s. So, what we think is possible in principle turns out to be impossible &amp;lsquo;in principle&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many come up with criticisms like &amp;lsquo;Buddhist logics are different&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;one has to follow Indian logics&amp;rsquo;. These criticisms sound profound! They are damn shallow, unless they answer the following questions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What is their structure?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What are their axioms?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What are their rules of inferences?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What are some some crucial meta-logical theorems (do they all have deduction theorems?) etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What does it mean to be an Indian in this time and age? What does India have to give to the contemporary world? These overarching questions that echo in the mind of the post-colonial Indian cannot be truly answered by Western frameworks instituted at the behest of colonialism.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This book sets the stage for a reconceptualization of India studies. Clearing away intellectual deadwood, it initiates a process of comparative study of cultures. The volume scrutinizes the Western studies on India, including contemporary writings on Hinduism, the nature of inter-cultural dialogues, and their implications for normative political philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While re-reading certain passages from Richard Dawkins&amp;rsquo; The God Delusion (2006), I was so shocked by his combination of ignorance and arrogance. Forgive me for some Dawkins- bashing:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In a memorable passage, Dawkins discusses the problem of Trinitarianism in Christianity and extends it to other forms of &amp;ldquo;polytheism,&amp;rdquo; such as the cult of the Virgin Mary and the saints in Roman-Catholicism. &amp;ldquo;What impresses me about Catholic mythology,&amp;rdquo; he shares with the reader, &amp;ldquo;is partly its tasteless kitsch but mostly the airy nonchalance with which these people make up the details as they go along. It is just shamelessly invented&amp;rdquo; (Dawkins 2006: 35). As a reader, try to bracket away all presuppositions about religion and reread the sentences. If you succeed in doing so, the impact of Dawkins&amp;rsquo; claim dissolves. So what, if certain details of Roman-Catholicism are human inventions? What is the problem in aspects of religion being &amp;ldquo;shamelessly invented&amp;rdquo;? From a non-Christian, neutral point of view, it is unclear why Dawkins bothers to mention this. However, anyone with a basic understanding of the history of Christianity will note where his claim comes from: Dawkins himself reproduces a piece of theology in this sentence (apparently without knowing it). From its earliest beginnings, Christianity claimed that it was the original and pure revelation of God, first given to Adam. This original revelation had been corrupted by sinful idolaters, seduced by the Devil into the worship of the false god and his minions. This corruption, according to Christian theology, took the form of human additions to the pure divine revelation: rites and myths, fabricated by priests and prelates.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;During the Protestant Reformation, Luther, Calvin and their followers began to accuse the Roman-Catholic Church of the same sin of idolatry. They cried that the pope and his priests had invented a plethora of dogmas and rituals and imposed these on the believer as though they were part of God&amp;rsquo;s revelation and necessary to salvation. In this sense, the worst accusation one could make against Roman- Catholicism was that it consisted of &amp;ldquo;shameless human inventions.&amp;rdquo; The Enlightenment philosophes extended such charges of idolatry to all of Christianity and to all &amp;ldquo;religions&amp;rdquo; of humanity. All of these, including the notion of God itself, were human fabrications, the atheists among them claimed. Ironically, Enlightenment atheism thus presupposed and built on the claims of Christian theology. Without the background belief that there is something intrinsically wrong in religion being a human invention—very much a Christian belief—the impact of such charges simply disappears into thin air.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;People like Scott Atran and Sloan Wilson abuse evolutionary biology to produce ad hoc explanations of an explanandum whose truth they presuppose: the universality of religion. Their explanations are no better than those discussed by Balu in chapter 5 of &amp;lsquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://sites.google.com/site/colonialconsciousness/theheatheninhisblindness&#34;&gt;The Heathen in his blindness: Asia, the West and the dynamic of religion.&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;. Paraphrasing Balu, we may say that they consist of &amp;rsquo;two quarters of theology, a quarter of evolutionary biology and a quarter of illiterate ethnology&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Evolutionary explanations of religion: an exercise in petitio principii</title>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is very disappointing to see how these evolutionary theorists of religion lack knowledge of religions other than garden variety Judeo-Christianity (where they seem to have at least some factual knowledge, as in Scott Atran&amp;rsquo;s case, they reproduce standard textbook stories about Hinduism that have been left behind a few decades back).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If they did a serious study, it would perhaps strike them that no one has ever given either theoretical or empirical proof for the claim that religion is a human universal. From the 13th century onwards, European travelers, missionaries, merchants and scholars simply assumed that there would be religion in all societies. With this assumption in the background, they looked for the &amp;lsquo;beliefs&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;gods&amp;rsquo; of these societies. In the process, these western minds invented religions everywhere. Later scholars began to create all kinds of definitions of &amp;ldquo;religion&amp;rdquo; in order to accommodate their (cultural) intuition that religion is universal. As though a definition of a word can help us decide on the universality of a phenomenon. After all, we don&amp;rsquo;t use a definition of the word &amp;ldquo;gravitation&amp;rdquo; in order to find out whether gravitation exists on all planets, do we?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Intelligibility of Advaita</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The problem with the advaita tradition today is its lack of intelligibility. &amp;lsquo;Maya&amp;rsquo;, for instance, does a tremendous lot of explanatory work, but it is hardly clear what it is; multiple concepts like &amp;lsquo;manas&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;buddhi&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;chitta&amp;rsquo; occur and we do not know how these concepts relate to each other, whether they refer, whether they are a part of psychological theorizing or merely an exercise in philosophical anthropology. It is further unclear whether they are &amp;lsquo;psychological faculties&amp;rsquo; or theoretical terms. The nature of &amp;lsquo;atman&amp;rsquo; is unclear: is it a physical body or non-physical body? What its relationship to the organic body? Is it a form of monism (&amp;rsquo;everything is atman&amp;rsquo;) or dualism (&amp;lsquo;atman is the sovereign&amp;rsquo;) or something entirely different altogether? How do these terms relate to the different forms of psychological theories we have: from commonsense psychology to cognitive science? Further, it is unclear too what gets reborn if &amp;lsquo;punarjanma&amp;rsquo; means rebirth. If atman is not the organic body, is it an emergent property of the brain, or of consciousness? If not, how can it ever become &amp;lsquo;self-conscious&amp;rsquo;? And, of course, there is the preoccupation whether Advaita is compatible with the results of scientific research. These are merely some of the reasons why Advaita lacks intelligibility today.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I would have liked to make the following points on the IER forum but either of the two moderators are (obviously) willing to be courteous enough to post my letter on their forum, despite my explicit request. Let me react to their letters on this forum, and I shall leave it there for the time being.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Neither Michael Witzel nor Steve Farmer answers my request for clarifications but simply take off on polemical tones. I do not see what purpose is thereby served. Globally speaking, both their letters seem to indicate that they are convinced that either I am aligned with the Hindutva movement or that I am a Hindutva man myself or both. Of course, because we have not met each other so far, there is only one way for them to divine my political preferences: through my writings. Witzel claims that he has read them, whereas Farmer keeps silent about the issue. It is a matter of public record that I claim that &amp;lsquo;Hinduism&amp;rsquo; (as a &amp;lsquo;religion&amp;rsquo;) does not exist in India. Consequently, from my writings on the subject, no one can accuse me of supporting a stance that wants to found India on &amp;lsquo;hinduness&amp;rsquo; or on &amp;lsquo;hindudom&amp;rsquo; or on &amp;lsquo;Hinduism&amp;rsquo; (whether conceived as a &amp;lsquo;religion&amp;rsquo; or called as &amp;lsquo;sanatana dharma&amp;rsquo;). So, from where could anyone draw conclusion that these two have drawn?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Consider the following possibility: let us assume that in some of my writings, I reach the same conclusion as some or another ideologue from Hindutva. (Of course, neither Farmer nor Witzel shows that this is the case. But that is not the issue.) In other words, let us assume that, with respect to some or another issue, I arrive at the same conclusion as people from the Hinudtva movement do. The question is: what does that indicate, or prove or is an evidence for? After all, Witzel, Farmer and others reach the same conclusion as the Hindutva people do, when you ask them about the sum of two integers (say adding two to itself); or (assuming the presence of relevant There is only one answer possible in this case: there exists a unique theory (&amp;rsquo;the Hindutva theory&amp;rsquo;) from which one can derive certain conclusions. It is not possible to derive the same conclusion from any other theory that we know (or can invent). Consequently, one can argue backwards: if someone, anyone, supports a specific conclusion (&amp;rsquo;the Hindutva conclusion&amp;rsquo;) then that is because such a conclusion is derivable only from the &amp;lsquo;Hindutva theory&amp;rsquo;. Only a fool could entertain making such a claim today, if ever. Assuming that Witzel and Farmer are not fools, they appear reasonably intelligent to me, how then could they &amp;lsquo;see&amp;rsquo; Hindutva in my writings? A more charitable assumption would be: Witzel either has not read my writings (he lies when he says he has) or has not understood them at all (which makes him dim witted). Choose your poison.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Steve Farmer is not an expert on secularism only in the sense that he has followed it from the &amp;lsquo;outside&amp;rsquo; (meaning, probably, he has not written anything about the issue himself). Apparently, the reason why he has not contributed to the debate has to do with the fact that (a) no legitimate researcher can take the debate seriously; and (b) Farmer is one such. Witness how he describes it: &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve watched this so-called debate for nearly a decade now from the outside, and nothing whatsoever has changed. Nor have I ever met a single legitimate researcher who took it seriously.&amp;rdquo; I wish some of the Indian intellectuals who have participated in the debate would read this judgment and digest what Farmer thinks of them. They will be thrilled to know that they are &amp;lsquo;illegitimate&amp;rsquo; scholars!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How to access Indian traditions?</title>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I have often said, the most intriguing aspect of the Indian culture is the kind of knowledge it produced and encouraged people to produce: experiential knowledge which emerges by systematically reflecting on our (human) experiences in the world. As human beings, our experiences are many: no one set, no one kind of experience exhausts what we go through. From the purely personal experiences of the world (our ambitions, hopes, dreams, frustrations, etc) to the entirely social ones (the experiences of sorrow and injustice that other human beings in the world experience). So, knowledge that reflects on or thinks about and systematizes such experiences presupposes multiple learning sites, many diverse perspectives and varied kinds of intellectual skills.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Real vs. Existence</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/real-vs-existence/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;With some justifiable distortion, one can claim that the Indian Adhyatmic traditions revolve partially around some &amp;lsquo;philosophical&amp;rsquo; questions: what is real and what is existence? Is there a distinction between the two and, if yes, how to draw that line? This is a distortion because the debate never took this form; it is justifiable nonetheless to present it this way because it gives us a handle to tackle them today. However, we need to note that this is our way of posing the question, not theirs. Therefore, whether or not &amp;ldquo;believing&amp;rdquo; in Rama or Krishna entails the existence of such entities requires clarity about notions like &amp;rsquo;existence&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;belief&amp;rsquo; in the Indian traditions. I do not have this clarity and, only recently, I was told that the Indian intellectual traditions (in Sanskrit) do not have a word for &amp;lsquo;belief&amp;rsquo;. (It is as yet unclear to me what this implies: does it have the same force as the statement that Indians did not have a word for &amp;lsquo;gravitation&amp;rsquo; either or whether the notion of knowledge that we have is different from what we think knowledge is today.) Consequently, I cannot say much about this discussion today.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Historicity of Rama, Krishna, Anjaneya</title>
      <link>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/historicity-of-rama-krishna-anjaneya-s-n-balagangadhara/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/historicity-of-rama-krishna-anjaneya-s-n-balagangadhara/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the questions that has come up in this discussion is the following: are we logically forced to assume the &amp;rsquo;existence&amp;rsquo; of, say, Rama or Krishna, when we &amp;lsquo;believe&amp;rsquo; in them? This question has partly been responsible for the discussion about the &amp;lsquo;historicity&amp;rsquo; of Ramayana. Here is my answer as I see the situation today.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In some sense, we all work with some notions (however vague they might be) of &amp;lsquo;belief&amp;rsquo; and &amp;rsquo;existence&amp;rsquo;. These have at least two origins: (a) the western philosophical and scientific discourses about them, the way these have percolated into our common-sense; (b) their reinforcement by our day-to-day experiences in the world. That is to say, we have some conceptions of what human beings are (however vague or even incoherent these may be), what their properties are and so on. In other words, this notion of human beings tells us that (a) we are creatures who can form beliefs about some things (this &amp;lsquo;aboutness&amp;rsquo; is called intentionality in the relevant literatures); (b) that these beliefs could be about the world, about language, about ourselves, about what exists in the world and so on; (c) that some of these beliefs are about existent objects, whereas other beliefs are about non-existent objects; (d) and that to &amp;lsquo;believe in&amp;rsquo;, logically speaking, either entails or presupposes (it is irrelevant for now whether it is a presupposition or an entailment) that the entity we &amp;lsquo;believe in&amp;rsquo; is believed to exist. And so on. If we assume this picture of human beings to be true, then it follows that &amp;ldquo;believing in Rama or Krishna&amp;rdquo; has the same force as &amp;ldquo;believing in Christ or God&amp;rdquo;. Thus, one has to ascribe the logical truth about their existence to those who &amp;ldquo;believe in&amp;rdquo; these figures. In simple terms, if you &amp;ldquo;believe in&amp;rdquo; Rama or Krishna, then you are logically compelled to believe in their existence as well, just in case you endorse this picture about human beings.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/logical-acumen-of-romila-thapar/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the debates in the Indian traditions is about the kind of creatures that exist in the world and about the reality of what exists. The Jains, for instance, disagreed that the &amp;ldquo;deva&amp;rsquo;s&amp;rdquo; of other traditions (with the properties they were supposed to possess) existed in this world or were real. (Their so-called &amp;lsquo;atheism&amp;rsquo; is a result of this debate.) Consequently, when they call Valmiki Ramayana false, they are making claims about the logical falsehood. They did not, on the basis of some or another empirical enquiry, establish that Ravana was a vegetarian or that Rakshasas were human beings (in fact, in many parts of India, people believe that Ravana was both a Brahmin and a rakshasa at the same time) or that Rama was different from what Valmiki said he was. The same applies to Anjaneya: the claim of some or another author that he was a human being and was married does not either &amp;lsquo;prove&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;disprove&amp;rsquo; the claim of Valmiki.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It is a matter of fact that (a) they are not occupational groups; (b) they are not social classes (that is, there is no correlation between Jati&amp;rsquo;s and the &amp;lsquo;means of production&amp;rsquo;); (c) appear hereditary (though one could obtain certificates that &amp;lsquo;change&amp;rsquo; one&amp;rsquo;s Jati legally). Some Jati&amp;rsquo;s are organized as some kind of legal or semi-legal associations, some Jati&amp;rsquo;s are not.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You say: &amp;ldquo;If &amp;lsquo;caste&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;jati&amp;rsquo; has the same status as alumni associations and similar social groups, with their varying practices, it seems we are prepared to say that &amp;lsquo;jati&amp;rsquo; has no special place in the Indian society in the same way that my alumni association has no special status in Indian society.&amp;rdquo; This sentence is the problematic one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First of all, it does not follow (either empirically or logically) that if Jati is a social group much like alumini associations, trades unions, etc it has no special status in Indian society. That depends upon the role, function and the nature of such social groups and these are issues for empirical investigation. For instance, the &amp;ldquo;old boys&amp;rdquo; network&amp;quot; in Britian (comprising of aluminis from public schools and Oxbridge students) apparently plays a very important role in the British society. In certain circles of power in India, alumminis from private schools (like the Doon school, Lawrence school) and colleges like St. Stephens have built sophisticated networks that function like service clubs. In this sense, one cannot claim that alumini networks, by virtue of their composition, do not have a special status in a society. This is an empirical question. Your alumini association might indeed have no special place; that does not preclude some other alumini association from having an important place. (Similarly, by virtue of the fact that some particular trade union does not have a special status in Indian society, it is not possible to make claims about whether trades unions have a special status or not.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, both in India and abroad, we see the emergence of a new intellectual trend: based on painstaking research, to write an accurate history of India. What is &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; about this approach? In one sense, as I shall explain in this article, this attempt is not novel; in another sense, which too shall be explained, there is something very new in it. I shall talk about both in the course of answering the question raised in the title, which contrasts ‘the past’ with ‘a history’. This contrast needs explication because historiography is seen as an ‘accurate recording of the past’. Yet, I am going to contrast the product of historiography, ‘a history’, with something called ‘the past’.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Spelling-out Vivekananda&amp;rsquo;s stance regarding this theme presupposes the ability to provide convincing answers to questions about what Vivekananda thought &amp;ldquo;religion&amp;rdquo; was, what &amp;ldquo;truth&amp;rdquo; was, and how the latter relates to the former.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When a religion claims that it is the word of God and that the word is unconditionally true; and that, further, the word is about the Cosmos: everything that was, is and shall be. So, when I say that religion is such an entity, namely, it claims that it is the word of God and that it claims to be unconditionally true and that it is about the Cosmos, I am accepting the self description of religion. (However, the hypothesis that religion is an EI account formulates it without committing itself to any ontological claims. That is, it takes no stances about what specific religions say or do not say about the existence of entities. The hypothesis does not show how, and in what sense, the Bible, say, is an EI account. It merely says that The Bible has such a status to believers. If you reread the relevant paragraphs of &amp;lsquo;The Heathen&amp;hellip;&amp;rsquo; where I first formulate the hypothesis, you will notice that I formulate it conditionally: &amp;ldquo;If such a being exists, if such an account is forthcoming &amp;hellip; etc then we have an EI account.&amp;rdquo;) If we do not accept the self-description of religion, The Bible becomes a mere book and we cannot study it at all to say anything about Christianity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Secularized Christian theme: Hacker’s inclusivism and exclusivm</title>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When we consider  Paul Hacker&amp;rsquo;s story on &amp;lsquo;inclusivism as a typically Indian thought form&amp;rsquo;, all we can conclude is that he has used a &lt;em&gt;typically Christian  thought form&lt;/em&gt; to understand an aspect of the Indian cultural traditions, which he is unable to understand because it is completely different from what he knows. Hacker&amp;rsquo;s inclusivism is merely an attempt to strip the following Christian account from its recognizably Christian characteristics: &amp;ldquo;When God created man he inscribed him with a sense of divinity, and when it is &lt;em&gt;not corrupted&lt;/em&gt; this sense is the true religion. Throughout human history the devil and his minions corrupted this sense of divinity into false religion or worship of the devil among all human peoples. Until the good Lord brought mankind back to the true religion by revealing himself in Jesus Christ. Thus, Christianity is the one true religion. It is the message of self-disclosure in which God reveals his Will for the universe to the humankind. Of course, all other traditions contain traces of divine revelation, but these are nothing but the preparation of the Gospel. Once the true religion was revealed again, all non-Christian traditions could be nothing but pale and erring variants of Christianity.&amp;rdquo; Now Hacker has merely taken this Christian conceptual scheme to make sense of the attitude the Indian traditions take towards other traditions. Although it happens unconsciously most of the time, this is &lt;em&gt;the basic method of Indology&lt;/em&gt;: one looks at the Indian traditions, and the only way to make sense of them is to make them fit into a conceptual framework of secularized Christian theology.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Usefulness of Dictionaries</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Opening a dictionary to find out the meaning of an English word might indeed be an elementary student&amp;rsquo;s choice, but, if used as a methodology for settling scientific and philosophical discussions, I am afraid, it is a rather poor choice. Imagine a physicist living around the turn of the last century doing something similar when Einstein formulated his special theory of relativity. &amp;ldquo;Oh! I say,&amp;rdquo; we can imagine this physicist saying, &amp;ldquo;The New Collegiate defines &amp;lsquo;mass&amp;rsquo; as an invariable property of an object, and this chap from the Patent Office calls it a variable!&amp;rdquo; I suppose one should be grateful to Einstein that he relied less on Webster to solve scientific problems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If we want to grasp the nature of the discussions in the Indian traditions, there is much we need to do beforehand: (a) identify the entity they were talking about; (b) identify the specific questions they were answering; (c) identify the generic questions that defined both the outlines of the acceptable answers and the formulation of the specific questions; etc. (The &amp;lsquo;cetera&amp;rsquo; indicates that I do not know how to enumerate all the things we need to grasp.) In the case of the propositions you have formulated, I assume that &amp;lsquo;God&amp;rsquo; is Vishnu (or even Krishna) and not, say, Shiva or Brahma because you are talking about the Madhvas. However, to keep the discussion faithful to your formulations, I will use the word &amp;lsquo;God&amp;rsquo; to refer to Vishnu.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Superstition and rationality</title>
      <link>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/superstition-and-rationality/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/superstition-and-rationality/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Consider the question: &amp;ldquo;why superstition?&amp;rdquo; Our problem lies in circumscribing this notion itself: is it something we should use to characterize beliefs, or attitudes, or theories or actions or all of them? Our linguistic usage allows it mostly of &amp;lsquo;beliefs&amp;rsquo; and to the act of believing: to believe that walking under the ladder brings bad; to believe that vampires exist and walk as ordinary humans in the night; to believe in the fairy who watches over you, etc. are all instances of superstition. It also allows us to use it in connection to the truth status of theories like, for instance, the claim that it is superstitious to believe in astrology. However, accepting this usage is not enough: what makes a belief a superstitious belief or an act of believing a superstitious act? It is here that many, many problems come to the fore. One easy way out is to use science and scientific theories as the contrast set: any belief that is not countenanced by the scientific theories of today is a superstitious belief. Of course, this is too broad: on this account, every belief that displaces the current scientific beliefs (i.e., the new scientific theories) becomes superstitious. If you try and circumvent this problem by speaking about &amp;lsquo;scientific theories&amp;rsquo; in the abstract (i.e., do not circumscribe them in time), the danger is that every belief (almost) escapes the net. Just because scientific theories of today do not recognize the existence of ghosts, it does not follow, one could argue, that the sciences of tomorrow cannot recognize the role that mediums play in talking to the spirits of the long departed. You can try and say that all beliefs disproved by science should belong to the set of superstitious beliefs: however, similar problems occur. On top of it, you have the difficulty of saying why one should not have superstitious beliefs. And so on.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Is Maya an Illusion? Nonsense sold by Scholars!</title>
      <link>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/is-maya-an-illusion-nonsense-sold-by-scholars/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;According to your account, Vedanta claims that the &lt;em&gt;world is an illusion&lt;/em&gt; and that only the Brahman is real.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the world is an illusion, Vedanta has to deny the reality of the world. To it, in the way you construe Vedanta, the world &lt;em&gt;is the empty set&lt;/em&gt;. That is to say, all experiences are on par because they are all illusions. One cannot distinguish between experiences unless one introduces the notion of a differentiated reality. From this, it follows that a vedantin should not be able to discriminate, say, between the following: the pain you have by stubbing your toe, the pain you have when your arm is cut off without anaesthesia, and the pain you feel when your loved one dies. If he does draw a distinction between them, he is distinguishing one illusion from the other and the only way of doing that is to ascribe to these illusions the status of reality: this is &amp;rsquo;less illusory&amp;rsquo; than… this is &amp;lsquo;more real&amp;rsquo; than… this &amp;lsquo;pains more than&amp;rsquo;… this pain is &amp;lsquo;different from&amp;rsquo;…and so on. If he does not distinguish, and insists there is no difference between falling in a lake and bumping his head against a tree, who would take him seriously? Do you believe that Indians are such cretins that they would simply accept such inane stories? Surely, if &amp;lsquo;Brahman&amp;rsquo; is all there is to Vedanta, all vedantins must be perfect imbeciles. In that case, we do not need heavy-duty tantric stuff to shoot them down; a simple dose of commonsense will do.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What is rubbish about the ‘self’ and what not?</title>
      <link>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/what-is-rubbish-about-the-self-and-what-not/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 27 Aug 2011 08:49:00 +0530</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/what-is-rubbish-about-the-self-and-what-not/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few points about &amp;lsquo;self&amp;rsquo; and about what I have said and have not.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt; Comment: &amp;ldquo;Say, Mr. X made 1 run, 2 runs, 3, 4, n, and a total of 50 runs. Now to say &amp;ldquo;I made 50 runs&amp;rdquo; is to assume that, Mr. X who made 1 run, 2 run, etc. is linked to each other, and this organism , in this sense, has a unity. This unity is what Balu calls rubbish&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, I do not call this &amp;lsquo;unity&amp;rsquo; rubbish. Second, this is a problem not pertaining to &amp;rsquo;the self&amp;rsquo; but one applicable to any object or entity that persists over time. Because we can speak about the spatial and temporal career of an object (whether it involves disassembling and then reassembling a watch or whether it is about a merger of two corporations or firms or about our bodies or whatever), the logical problem of identity crops up: what makes some object, any object, the same object at different spatial and temporal intervals? I.e. how can the organism (currently called &amp;lsquo;Balu&amp;rsquo;, say) be the same organism when, as it spatially and temporally moves in the world, it accrues different properties? After all, &amp;lsquo;Balu&amp;rsquo; at some spatio-temporal point (say when the organism is 5 years old) has properties different from &amp;lsquo;Balu&amp;rsquo; at some other spatio-temporal interval. Because these two spatio-temporal units do not have identical properties, they have to be different objects. Yet, we say &amp;lsquo;here is Balu&amp;rsquo;s photo when he was 5 years old&amp;rsquo;. The problem of logical identity crops up in such contexts. As I say, this is a problem that confronts any theory of identity (as a logical relationship). Philosophy of logic has provided a few solutions to this question even if they all face problems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Does Feynman know about his culture?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Paraphrasing Feynman: &amp;ldquo;the answers proposed like counting angels that can dance on the head of a pin are trivial.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am not in the least impressed by (in fact, I am disgusted by and contemptuous about) the attitude of the likes of Feynman. Here is one reason why: I too have a criticism of (some) social sciences and (some) aspects of the western philosophy. I too consider that some of these social sciences are not sciences in any sense of the term. But that is because I believe that some of these disciplines endlessly embroider theology and I feel that my research might go someway in setting the situation straight. In other words, as far as I am concerned, the current state of social science is a problem which requires to be addressed seriously. The reason for the seriousness must be obvious: we &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to urgently understand the nature of human beings in all its facets, if we have to survive as a species. Making fun of philosophy and social sciences is one thing; to do something about it is entirely different.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Ad hoc explanations: why do puja to cows?</title>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When we provide explanations, we should also look at their contrastive nature: why do puja to cows and not to buffalos? The problem in this case, however, is this: the explanation one gives about a tradition (you will soon see that one of the problems is to identify the explanandum itself) must also incorporate this contrast. Someone like Kanch Ilaiah has answered this question thus: the puja to cows and not to the buffalos expresses racism (that is at the origin of the caste system) because cows are white and buffaloes are always dark. In other words, you cannot simply ask for a contrastive explanation without incorporating it in a &amp;lsquo;bigger&amp;rsquo; explanation that explains the explanandum.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Arguments vs. theories</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/arguments-vs-theories/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have discovered that there is a fundamental difference between arguments and theory-building. As a philosopher, I have come to think that one could argue almost any position, within reasonable limits. Mostly, they consist of putting across plausible, or even logically possible considerations in order to show that either some point is plausible or that it could be true. Up to a point, arguments have a function: they force you to reason, check for inconsistencies, train your thinking process, etc. However, you must remember that ultimately all you have done is make a sentence or a set of sentences sound plausible or shown it to be logically consistent and possible. More often than not, it has a psychological purpose as well: that of shooting down some person, demonstrate intelligence, exhibit stupidity and so on. However exhilarating it might be at times, this is a very unproductive occupation, if carried on too far: one does not advance knowledge a great deal.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Brig SK Malik’s theory of war and terrorism</title>
      <link>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/brig-sk-maliks-theory-of-war-and-justification-of-crimes/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What Brig SK Malik says supports &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/the-saint-the-criminal-and-the-terrorist-s-n-balagangadhara/&#34;&gt;my thesis&lt;/a&gt;about terrorism, instead of making it redundant, as one suggests. Here is how.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In war, killing the enemy is considered a moral and justifiable act, even though &amp;lsquo;killing a fellow human being&amp;rsquo; is considered immoral. (This includes many provisos, including that the war is justified.) That is to say, a theory of just war (and warfare) justifies what is actually an act of murder. This justification is moral in nature and occurs on the presupposition that &amp;lsquo;killing in a war is a good thing&amp;rsquo;. That is why we give medals to supererogatory acts in times of war, like &amp;lsquo;medals for bravery&amp;rsquo; for instance. (There are many people who do not buy this; hence they are pacifists.) Brig SK Mailk&amp;rsquo;s theory of war and warfare justifies &amp;rsquo;terror&amp;rsquo; (basically the domain of crime): it does so by (a) transforming an entire population (the Indians) into the &amp;lsquo;other&amp;rsquo; (&amp;rsquo;the enemy&amp;rsquo;); (b) justifying any and every action against everyone belonging to or supporting this (Indian) community into &amp;rsquo;the enemy&amp;rsquo;; (c) making no distinction between &amp;rsquo;the soldier&amp;rsquo; and &amp;rsquo;the civilian&amp;rsquo; (whereas every theory of warfare makes this distinction, without which the notion of &amp;lsquo;war&amp;rsquo; threatens to become meaningless); and, above all, (d) by presenting it as a theory of &amp;lsquo;war&amp;rsquo;. That is to say, Brigadier SK Malik is justifying crime in the name of war.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What is the relationship between religious intolerance and the acts committed in Mumbai?&amp;rdquo; This is an empirical question at many levels. If some or another religion is used to defend the attacks in Mumbai, then it depends very much on the kinds of justifications used; the kind of theology in question; the relationship between the belief-states of the perpetrators and their motives; the relationship between their acts and their religious beliefs; and so on. Religious intolerance might or might not lead to conversion, to persecution of those who have &amp;lsquo;other&amp;rsquo; beliefs, to playing the &amp;lsquo;priest&amp;rsquo; and so on. What cannot be said, anyway, is that religious intolerance necessarily leads to Mumbai attacks. However, religious intolerance always harbors such a possibility. Whether or not such a possibility also occurs in our world depends on many, many empirical circumstances I have no clear view of.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first thing to notice is that I use the word &amp;ldquo;ideology&amp;rdquo; in a technical sense, which is both counter-intuitive and, for the time being, idiosyncratic. It is the first, namely counter-intuitive, because, as I use it, my use of the word does not refer to any theory, or to sets of beliefs, or to what one believes in. Normally, as we use the word in English, &amp;lsquo;ideology&amp;rsquo; has multiple meanings: a false consciousness; accepting a theory known to be false; presenting the interests of a small strata of people as the universal interests of all; subscribing to premises that are either unjustified or not-examined; and so on. My use has no such connotation. It is the second, namely idiosyncratic, because I have not yet developed a hypothesis about ideology that can explain and justify my use of the word.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Increasingly, the phenomenon of terrorism has begun to occupy the media, politics, and the lives of people in different parts of the world. The more the attention, however, the less the clarity: what kind of a phenomenon is terrorism? What generates it, what sustains it, and what allows it to expand on an ever-increasing scale?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This lack of clarity has to do with the fact that our ideas about terrorism appear as an incoherent set. First, terrorism horrifies most of us; the acts of terrorists are seen as monstrous in scope and size. But the number of deaths or the human suffering, even if we look at an event as momentous as 9/11, is dwarfed by what traffic accidents and smoking do in any given year.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Is bhakti what the bhaktas do, or are people bhaktas because they &amp;lsquo;follow&amp;rsquo; (bad choice of words, but there is no other way to put it) the &amp;lsquo;bhakti marga&amp;rsquo;, or is bhakti &lt;em&gt;neither&lt;/em&gt; of the two? I mean: is the bhakta moved because, for example, the child who stole the butter happens to be the &lt;em&gt;Kannan&lt;/em&gt;, or because the &lt;em&gt;child&lt;/em&gt;, who also happens to be the Lord, stole the butter? If it is the first, it is &lt;em&gt;worthless&lt;/em&gt;: it is the same as being a sycophant (as the Americans would put it: one sucks up to &amp;hellip;). If the second, it is false: surely, we are not moved to tears when our children steal and the lie about it. When the mother gets to hear from a child: &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;I&amp;rsquo; did not steal&amp;rdquo; and, as proof, gets to see the &amp;lsquo;vishwarupa&amp;rsquo; (in the mouth where the speech manifests itself) and &amp;lsquo;sees&amp;rsquo; the Cosmos (all that ever was, is and shall be) in an &amp;lsquo;I&amp;rsquo; &amp;ndash; what is the question, and what the answer?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sasheej Hegde in his EPW article says: &amp;ldquo;A theory of secularism in the sense of a theory about possessing the concept &amp;lsquo;secular&amp;rsquo; is quite distinct from a theory about how the concept secular represents.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is downright incoherent. He obviously thinks that a theory about secularism (which is a political theory) is about &amp;lsquo;possessing the concept of the secular&amp;rsquo; (which is &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/fuss-about-indic-categories-ii/&#34;&gt;a psychological theory about having concepts&lt;/a&gt; in general). The latter, he says, is different about a philosophical theory about how any concept &amp;lsquo;represents&amp;rsquo;. It is true, a political theory about secularism is different from a psychological theory about human beings acquire concepts and both of these are different from a philosophical theory about how any concept represents what it purports to represent.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Criticism: Are we living in barrenness?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I do not assume that, as you put it, &amp;ldquo;we are living in complete barrenness of thought but for the light which Balu has thrown.&amp;rdquo; One would be doing the members of this forum a great disservice by attributing such an assumption to them. They do not believe in this claim anymore than I do. I do not accept this claim at all. From the many reasons I have for not accepting this ridiculous claim, let me mention just two. The first is my belief that my intellectual endeavors merely reproduce the macro-pattern of India on an atomic scale: my life is the Indian history writ small. I know far too many people on so many parallel paths involved in the kind of research I am doing to make myself believe that I am the genius the world has been waiting for. There is a second reason. The development of my story would have been impossible but for the existence of stories penned by other people and the earlier generations of both Indians and westerners. Every single &lt;code&gt;error&#39; and &lt;/code&gt;mistake&amp;rsquo; made by, say, the colonial writers on India is a problem to solve: why did they make the mistakes they did? Answers to this question constitute one of the parameters that render my story scientific. The scientificity of my story presupposes the &lt;code&gt;errors&#39; and &lt;/code&gt;mistakes&amp;rsquo; of the earlier generations. In much the same way, my errors and mistakes will be the presuppositions for the subsequent attempts in building a better theory. (This is also a prosaic formulation of the Hegelian-Marxist notion of `critique&amp;rsquo;.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Creation stories: Christianity vs. Indian traditions</title>
      <link>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/creation-stories-christianity-vs-indian-traditions/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/creation-stories-christianity-vs-indian-traditions/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Of course there are any number of stories in other cultures, &amp;lsquo;Hinduism&amp;rsquo; included, about the creation of the world and what happened ever since. However, not every story about the creation of the world (let us stick to these kind of stories) has the quality of making the world &amp;rsquo;the Cosmos, that is&amp;rsquo; into an explanatorily intelligible entity. The Big-Bang theory is also a story about the creation of the world, but again, it misses the quality of the story told by religions, i.e. what &lt;em&gt;explains&lt;/em&gt; the Cosmos is also what makes it &lt;em&gt;intelligible&lt;/em&gt;. Or, as the Christians say: it was God&amp;rsquo;s will to create the world and His will was also the cause of the world&amp;rsquo;s existence. (Other dispositions attributed to God, such as His perfect goodness, etc. are important too, but I will ignore them here.) Given this, it is not clear to me what point you are trying to make. If it is your claim that the many stories in India are equivalent to the Biblical story in Christianity, you are wrong. This is exactly the assumption that was made by the missionaries when they confronted &amp;lsquo;Hinduism&amp;rsquo;. The only difference is that, then, they were attacked as being &amp;lsquo;false&amp;rsquo; and that, now, they are hailed for expressing the beauty of the Indian &amp;lsquo;faith&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I do understand the anger that people feel when they read Jeffrey Kripal&amp;rsquo;s and other people&amp;rsquo;s assessment of Indian traditions. If someone were to come up with a similar distortion of my own cultural heritage, I would probably feel the same. However, I do feel troubled when people end up calling Kripal a &amp;ldquo;cheat&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo;, a &amp;ldquo;spiritual bandit&amp;rdquo; or begin to speculate about hidden &amp;lsquo;agendas&amp;rsquo;. My problem is not that these accusations are ad hominem. My problem is that they threaten to obscure a genuine intellectual problem of a more serious nature.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;(1) What is called &amp;lsquo;mysticism&amp;rsquo; in the western culture is not the same &lt;em&gt;kind&lt;/em&gt; of experience that the different Indian traditions talk about. (2) I do think, as a corollary, that to describe the Indian &amp;rsquo;enlightenment&amp;rsquo; (let me use this word temporarily, the scare quotes indicate my reservations) as &amp;lsquo;mysticism&amp;rsquo; is not to understand either. (3) There are different levels in and different ways to achieve &amp;rsquo;enlightenment&amp;rsquo;. (4) It is extremely important and significant that finitely different means to achieve this state have been worked out by each of these ways. I want to go further in exploring the significance of these points and in exploring this state of &amp;rsquo;enlightenment&amp;rsquo; that the Indian traditions talk about.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Scholars and their freedom of opinion</title>

      <pubDate>Wed, 06 Apr 2011 02:45:20 +0530</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/scholars-and-their-freedom-of-opinion/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some have expressed the &amp;lsquo;opinion&amp;rsquo; that we should all be properly grateful that people express a point of view, even if they do not enter into a debate with the readers, and that the reader should either take this or leave it. Such opinions are based on either a shallow or wrong understanding of what the &amp;lsquo;freedom&amp;rsquo; to express one&amp;rsquo;s opinion is all about. The legal system does not allow one to &amp;lsquo;simply&amp;rsquo; express one&amp;rsquo;s point of view and &amp;rsquo;leave it at that&amp;rsquo;: the existence of defamation suits is ample testimony to this. In countries in Europe, there are legal guidelines about marketing and advertisement: one cannot simply advertise one&amp;rsquo;s product &amp;lsquo;in any which way&amp;rsquo;. In cases which have engaged people&amp;rsquo;s passions, those who write columns are also bound by ethical obligations to &lt;em&gt;respond&lt;/em&gt;. Jeffrey Kripal and Patrick Hogan are teachers who have the moral and social task of &lt;em&gt;forming&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;educating&lt;/em&gt; young minds. They cannot simply express a point of view and &amp;rsquo;leave it at that&amp;rsquo;. Their teaching must be based on rational grounds. When challenged &lt;em&gt;precisely&lt;/em&gt; on these grounds by a layer in society, they have the &lt;em&gt;ethical obligation&lt;/em&gt; to respond. They also claim to be intellectuals and this entails that they act as such: defend their &amp;lsquo;points of view&amp;rsquo; by providing reasonable arguments. When the latter is challenged, the demands of rationality oblige them to respond. For whatever it is worth, they appeal to their membership in the academia as researches and scientists too. This membership &lt;em&gt;obliges&lt;/em&gt; them to respond to criticisms: without criticism, there is no possibility of growth of knowledge. So on and so forth. May I therefore kindly request the advocates of free speech to hold their peace, and that they catch up with their reading of Law and Ethics before they preach sermons to the rest of us?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Earlier, I suggested that the psychoanalytical explanations (like the transformation of Linga into a penis as a fertility symbol etc.) not only trivialize and distort but also deny access to our own experience. In this post, I want to highlight &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; of the consequences of transforming our experiences in this fashion. In at least two different ways, &lt;em&gt;these explanations hinder the emergence of alternative or different explanations of our experiences&lt;/em&gt;. This is relevant to both of us. That is why, when confronted with such explanations, we do not know &lt;em&gt;what to say&lt;/em&gt;. These explanations rob us not only of our experience; while doing so, they shut us up as well. As far as you are concerned, while rendering you deaf to the silence from our end, it further &lt;em&gt;blinds&lt;/em&gt; you. If this is the case, one might as well ask oneself what you describe. Are you describing what you &amp;lsquo;see&amp;rsquo; in the mystical Ramakrishna? You could not: after all, what can you see, when you are blind? Nor it could be that you describe what you hear: you have become deaf to us. What, then, are you describing when you describe &lt;em&gt;your experience&lt;/em&gt;? This issue is what this post will be about.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>BJP does not have Intellectuals!</title>
      <link>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/bjp-does-not-have-intellectuals/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 05 Apr 2011 04:40:20 +0530</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/bjp-does-not-have-intellectuals/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I see it, the issue is not whether Arun Shourie is an intellectual (or whether Prakash Karat and EMS Namboodaripad represent intellectuals). The point I was trying to make is the one between a social movement and intellectuals.  Any movement that captures the imagination of a people (or even of a cross-section of a people) has to have some or another kind of narrative. Normally, the crafting of such a narrative involves the labor of intellectuals. Congress had one such when it was a mass movement; however, it lost that narrative in the course of the last decades. In the process of losing its own narrative, it has also accommodated multiple voices and narrators: the so-called &amp;lsquo;radical&amp;rsquo; intellectuals in India have prospered under the congress rule. The Communist Parties have their intellectuals, both native and foreign and from yesterday and today. The BJP did find resonance in a cross-section of the people in India and yet it does not appear to possess a distinct narrative of its own. The fact that BJP gets characterized in different ways (&amp;lsquo;Hindu Fundamentalist&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;Fascist&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;Nationalist&amp;rsquo;, etc) by different people indicates that these characterizations have more to do with the theory that one accepts about these phenomena (&amp;lsquo;religious fundamentalism&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;fascism&amp;rsquo;, &amp;rsquo;nationalism&amp;rsquo;, etc) than they have to do with the &amp;lsquo;story&amp;rsquo; that BJP tells. Furthermore, the BJP is also hostile to intellectuals: in fact, it is very typical to hear them identify &amp;lsquo;intellectuals&amp;rsquo; with &amp;lsquo;secular thinkers&amp;rsquo;. It is almost as though they think that this social layer, which the intellectuals are, is an &amp;lsquo;alien growth&amp;rsquo; in the Indian culture, something that the British created. While it is undoubtedly true that the kind of academic intellectuals we have today are outgrowths of colonial and post-colonial developments, this situation does not quite explain the hostility of the BJP. Hostility towards knowledge is not &amp;rsquo;native&amp;rsquo; to the Indian culture. At the same time, BJP is not hostile to something that is really &amp;lsquo;alien&amp;rsquo; to Indian culture: Nationalism. Instead, the &amp;lsquo;ideologues&amp;rsquo; of the BJP try to spin a deeply &amp;rsquo;nationalist&amp;rsquo; story.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The theories (and discussions) about secularism constitute a test case for the claims advanced in &amp;lsquo;The Heathen in his blindness: Asia, the West and the dynamic of religion&amp;rsquo; about the universalizing drive of religion. I have suggested that religion spreads by secularizing itself, and that the distinction between the secular and the religious is drawn by and within a religion. If this is the case, then it must be possible to show that the current theories of secularism are secularizations of a particular set of theological claims. (Theology draws these distinctions and defends them.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, the European Parliament hosted a meeting on &amp;ldquo;caste discrimination in South Asia&amp;rdquo;. At the meeting, participants stated that &amp;ldquo;India is being ruled by castes not by laws&amp;rdquo; and that they demanded justice, because there &amp;ldquo;is one incredible India and one untouchable India.&amp;rdquo; The EU was urged to come out with a policy statement on the subject. One MEP, referring to the caste system, said that &amp;ldquo;this barbarism has to end.&amp;rdquo; This is not the first time. However, before the EU decides to publish policy statements on caste discrimination in India, we would do well to reflect on some simple facts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Because I believe that one can answer questions about the circumscription of the words &amp;lsquo;Indian&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;western&amp;rsquo; cultures satisfactorily (Balangangadhara, 1994), I will assume their intelligibility in what follows. In this paper, I want to raise a rather intriguing problem about comparing these two cultures. I shall do that without looking at other approaches to the issue and in the form of an argument. In order to come to the point quickly, let me make use of Said&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Orientalism.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The sustained efforts by certain Hindu groups in the west to redefine and &amp;ldquo;correct&amp;rdquo; long existing Hindu traditions are perhaps reflective of their desire to put in place a cogent and structured religious system that is able to hold its own against other scripture-based religions. Concomitantly, American identity politics and European political correctness is also &amp;ldquo;forcing&amp;rdquo; minority communities to assert their separate &amp;ldquo;churches&amp;rdquo;, as a way of emphasising their own distinct religious or ethnic identity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On the Indian Debate and Its Western Origins&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The rise of Hindutva has often been interpreted as a threat to the secular state. Similarly, the recent outbursts of Hindu-Muslim conflict are said to be related to the decay of secularism. The author argues that the concept of secularism is fundamentally obscure, since it is founded upon an arbitrary distinction between the religious and the secular. The belief that religion should be separated from politics is a normative dogma that precedes all theoretical analysis of the Indian situation. Therefore, this concept of secularism prevents us from understanding the problems of pluralism in contemporary India, instead of helping us to solve them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Indian debate on religious conversion has been an ongoing one for a few centuries now. However, the mutual understanding between the advocates and the adversaries of conversion has not advanced much. This paper suggests that this is due to the fact that Hindus and Christians refer to two different objects when they discuss &amp;lsquo;religion&amp;rsquo;. The traits which the Christians ascribe to religion account for the premium they put on the right to convert, while the traits of the Hindu view of religion explain the opposition to conversion. As the two parties attribute mutually exclusive properties to religion, they encounter difficulties while seeking to make sense of each other&amp;rsquo;s claims about religion and conversion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Europeans from diverse ideological and religious backgrounds identified the brahmins as priests and brahmanism as a &amp;lsquo;religion of the priests&amp;rsquo;. This common understanding derived its consistency from a Christian understanding of religion. Even the writings of Rammohun Roy and Babasaheb Ambedkar, this article suggests, reveal an unconditional acceptance of Europe&amp;rsquo;s conceptualisation in a debate over religion that continued into the 20th century&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the last few decades, &amp;ldquo;secularism&amp;rdquo; has become the subject of caustic debate in the Indian media. The dispute about the value of this idea to contemporary India is no longer confined to the academic circles. Politicians, journalists and others have strong views on the topic. Secularism regularly surfaces in newspaper articles, speeches and public meetings. The critics of the idea, however, are not often taken seriously at the theoretical level. The proponents of secularism dismiss all objections against their pet idea as misguided. Critics are either considered to be naive obscurantists, who dream of a return to a romantic image of Indian traditional society; or they are condemned as Hindu fundamentalists, who resist modern secular values and strive for a Hindu religious state.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Review of &lt;em&gt;Imaging Hinduism: A Postcolonial perspective.&lt;/em&gt; By Sharada Sugirtharajah. Routledge, 2003. 164 pages&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt; This book is the first of its kind to bring post-colonial perspectivesinto a study of Hinduism. Consequently, there are no conventionalreference points for the author to use to build her narrative. She has to figure out how to use the conceptual apparatus ofthe one to study the other. In this sense, although the bookis experimental in its nature, there is nothing hesitant ortentative about some of the conclusions she draws. How successfulis the author in bringing the two, the study of Hinduism anda post-colonial perspective, together? If someone is influencedby post-colonial thought, the judgment will have to be in thepositive. However, having never been enamored by this genreof thinking, I find her framework both limiting and damagingto the study of Hinduism. Before I identify some of my problems,a few words about the book are necessary.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In years to come, the Indian community in the U.S. will face a major challenge from American pluralism. This is the first time a powerful community of pagans has to be accommodated within the American society. The NRI community is well-educated, well-to-do and proud of its cultural traditions. At the same time, the representation of the Indian traditions in the U.S. educational system shows a pathetic level of understanding. I will argue that recent events like the California textbook controversy point to a profound problem: &lt;em&gt;the American model of pluralism is unable to accommodate these pagan traditions&lt;/em&gt;. This is the case, because its structure has emerged from a co-existence of Protestant denominations. Maximally, the resulting model could encompass other variants of the religions of the book: Catholicism, Judaism and Islam. Incorporating the pagan traditions of India, however, will require a fundamental rethinking of American pluralism.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Towards a positive portrayal of Hindu traditions?</title>
      <link>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/towards-a-positive-portrayal-of-hindu-traditions/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What is at stake in the California textbook controversy? Few would agree that it concerns only the image of Hinduism as offered to the pupils of the California state schools. The controversy involves much more than that alone. It is the next phase in the NRI community&amp;rsquo;s struggle for a less biased and more benign portrayal of Hinduism in the educational system and in American society in general. In the last three years many similar incidents have occurred: the acrimonious debate about &amp;lsquo;Wendy&amp;rsquo;s Child Syndrome&amp;rsquo;; the Kripal and Courtright controversies; the indignation about the depiction of Hindu deities on bikini&amp;rsquo;s, slippers and toilet seats; etc. These transient outbursts express a solid and growing concern about the derogatory conceptions of the Hindu traditions, which still dominate the western societies and academia. In very general terms, the aim of this struggle could be put as follows: to make the world aware of the positive contributions the Indian culture and its traditions have made and can make to humanity. Since this is an aim I share, I would like to assess the NRI community&amp;rsquo;s progress towards its realization. This evaluation will take the California textbook controversy as a reference point, while addressing some of the broader issues involved.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Translations or Travesty of Traditions? –S.N.Balagangadhara</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In one sense, the title of the piece captures the nature of the tasks facing the contemporary generation, whether in India or in the Diaspora. This generation, unlike many from mine, is confident and self-assured; perhaps, it is proud too about the strength of its culture and traditions. Rightly so. However, personal convictions about the value of our traditions and culture do not automatically guarantee the truth of such convictions. Not only that. It is also the case that the history of India, and that of the entire humankind, requires of us that we are able to say and show what is valuable and what is not in our traditions. This history is the history of colonialism, subservience, and is further weighed down by the scientific, technological, economic and the military weight of the western culture. Today, we need more than a mere practice and a further continuation of our traditions; we need also to examine them honestly and critically in order that we may transmit what we found valuable in them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>To Follow Our Forefathers: The Nature of Tradition –S.N.Balagangadhara</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While reading this contribution and all the others (&lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/translations-or-travesty-of-traditions-s-n-balagangadhara/&#34;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/why-understand-the-western-culture-s-n-balagangadhara/&#34;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;) I hope to write, we need to keep the context in mind. The context is this: many intellectuals, both in India and among the NRIs elsewhere, appear bent on transforming our multiple traditions into a single &amp;lsquo;religion&amp;rsquo; called &amp;lsquo;Hinduism&amp;rsquo;. The problem does not lie in the transformation of variety and diversity into a unity. Rather, it lies in trying to fit our traditions into the straightjacket of &amp;lsquo;religion&amp;rsquo;. While calling ourselves &amp;lsquo;Hindus&amp;rsquo; might be a convenient way of talking, the danger lies in going further and trying to develop &amp;lsquo;doctrines&amp;rsquo;, &amp;rsquo;theologies&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;catechisms&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;Ten Commandments&amp;rsquo; so that those around us in the West could recognize us as followers of a religion called &amp;lsquo;Hinduism&amp;rsquo;. (These reflections are also applicable to &amp;lsquo;Buddhism&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;Jainism&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;Saivism&amp;rsquo; and all such entities.) In the course of my future contributions, I will look at some of the compulsions that force us to manufacture &amp;lsquo;Hinduism as a religion&amp;rsquo;. In this piece, I want to focus on the nature of traditions. What is a tradition? What differentiates religions from traditions? The second question will remain implicit until the end. By that time, we should have a better understanding of what it means to speak of a tradition.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Let me begin this contribution, the third piece about our culture and traditions(&lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/to-follow-our-forefathers-the-nature-of-tradition-s-n-balagangadhara/&#34;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/translations-or-travesty-of-traditions-s-n-balagangadhara/&#34;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;), by sharing something you are familiar with. Very often, I have heard the NRI parents in the USA making the following remark:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I came to the US so many decades ago, I knew very little about Hinduism. My ignorance was driven home when I had children and they began to ask what Hinduism was. Because I had to educate them, I ended up learning more about Hinduism in the US (thanks to this or that organization or Swami) than during all the years I spent in India.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Translation or Theoretical Dispute: electron, dharma</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In our daily life, we hardly pause to reflect upon many problematic things that we routinely assume as self-evident. Such an attitude is useful since it allows us to focus on other things that occupy us at that moment. One such attitude is not to bestow too much care on how we use language: we routinely speak of similarity in meaning, identical concepts, exact and accurate translations and so on. As long as issues like meaning etc. are not at dispute, talking like this causes no harm. However, in the current case, we are talking about the meaning of &amp;lsquo;meaning&amp;rsquo; (in a manner of speaking). Consequently, we have to be careful about how we use language to convey what we want to say, and be clear about what thesis we intend to argue for.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When we go-about with our fellow human beings, we need to possess some or another idea about the nature of ourselves and our fellow human beings. (Call it, for the sake of convenience, an &amp;lsquo;intuitive theory&amp;rsquo; about human beings.) It is an implicit understanding because each one of us does not have to be a professional philosopher or psychologist to get along with ourselves and fellow human beings. So, in principle, we must possess a vocabulary to talk about human beings; if we do not, we can neither talk about human beings nor could we make sense of their actions in the world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Balagangadhara points out an inconsistent reasoning of  the western and westernized Scholars, as well as the last 400 years of humanities scholarship.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Let me summarise the dilemma. Some properties are necessary for some traditions (Judaism, Christianity, Islam) to be religions. If one accepts this, the threat is that other cultures appear not to have religions at all. For some reason or another (I discuss the reasons in chapters 3 through 7), other cultures are said to have religions too. However, the conditions under which other cultures are to have religion are precisely those that make it impossible for the Semitic religions to be religions. That is to say, if the Semitic religions are what religions are, other cultures do not have religions. If other cultures have religions, then the Semitic religions are not religions. The inconsistency lies in insisting that both statements are true.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Do we understand Colonialism?</title>
      <link>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/do-we-understand-colonialism/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 01 Apr 2011 18:32:33 +0530</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/do-we-understand-colonialism/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Colonialism has been one of the most significant phenomena in the history of humankind in the last three hundred years or so. Its importance can hardly be overstated. Yet, as many have said before, it has not been adequately theorized. There is of course a great deal of material on the histories, the effects, and the political resistances to colonialism. Reading them, however, &lt;strong&gt;merely increases the puzzlement about colonialism&lt;/strong&gt;: though it seems to be at &lt;strong&gt;the root of all the ills&lt;/strong&gt; of the modern world, what is not clear is how or why that is the case. Perhaps, that has to do with an implicit consensus shared by many: everyone appears to know what it is and most agree about its immoral nature. &lt;em&gt;Colonialism emerges as a self-clarifying and a self-explaining phenomenon. If it is self-luminescent and so manifest an evil, why did many people in the Metropolis argue both about the nature of the phenomenon and its moral status for centuries on end?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Christian Attitudes and The Rule of Law as the Mechanism of Secularization </title>
      <link>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/law-secularization-and-religious-attitudes/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 01 Apr 2011 06:22:11 +0530</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/law-secularization-and-religious-attitudes/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;So far, our answers have always taken this form: in the moment of secularization, the formal structures or cognitive schemes of Christianity are diffused accordingly as they lose their specific doctrinal content. In this formulation, it is as though the logical form of religion is able to spread itself by disposing of its semantic content. Thus, both the common sense of the West and the scholarly consensus of the academia accept the background assumptions of Christian doctrine, while they do not adopt its specific teachings. Balu has always been somewhat unhappy about this formulation. As he argues in &lt;a href=&#34;http://sites.google.com/site/colonialconsciousness/theheatheninhisblindness&#34;&gt;chapter 11 of `The Heathen in his blindness: Asia, the West and the dynamic of religion&amp;rsquo;&lt;/a&gt;, it is not a specific set of assumptions which spreads in society, but rather certain attitudes. The claims about the universality of religion, the meaning of life, the necessity of norms, the superiority of liberal democracy, etc. do not generally appear as explicit premises held by a group of people. Then, it seems the only explanation one can give is to ascribe them to these people as implicit assumptions. To some extent, this works: theories about the origin of religion, or the nature of morality, or human psychology all presuppose that certain assumptions are true. So if one intends to reveal the conceptual problems of these theories, it is fruitful to analyze these assumptions as the hidden premises of theorizing.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, when it comes to explaining how the Christian religion spreads in a secular form, these accounts are unconvincing. What happens? Do the implicit assumptions or formalized theological schemes expand their scope as a kind of unit ideas by jumping from mind to mind? In what realm do these assumptions and background frameworks exist and procreate? The problem becomes acute when we turn to the spread of secularized Christianity in pagan societies like the Indian. Do the elite of alienated intellectuals suddenly adopt these assumptions as the starting points of reasoning about politics and society? Do they spread automatically from the colonized elite to other layers of Indian society, because this is a basic dynamic of societies? Such answers would be unsatisfactory. But what then is the mechanism through which secularized religious schemes spread and structure the experience of an ever increasing number of individuals? This and other related questions have been bothering me for some time (not least because I have failed to solve any of them in my doctoral thesis).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;As Indians, if we have to access the Indian traditions we need two things: (a) it must be possible for us to access them; (b) we must know &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; to access them. That is to say, growing up in the Indian traditions not merely means that we have the possibility of accessing them if we want to but we have also learnt how to access them when we want to.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Only for the sake of convenience, let me put it this way: in so far as we are brought up in the Indian culture, &lt;em&gt;in ideal conditions&lt;/em&gt;, we learn two things: (a) we learn to access our experience (one kind of ability); (b) we also learn to access the Indian traditions that are the results of accesses that the earlier generations have had to their experience (a second kind of ability). If we get only the ability (a) transmitted to us, it is like reinventing the wheel but a through a cumbersome process: trial and error, stumbling and standing upright, going through dead ends and false avenues and so on. Some might succeed in this venture, yet others might fail. There are no signposts, no heuristics, and no established results to work with etc.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Understanding Buddha and Colonial Consciousness</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;How do we understand the idea that an enlightened person has no wants?&amp;rdquo; Before we understand what the idea says, it would be good to find out what it does not say. Understanding this would also allow us to appreciate the depth and extent of colonial consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you look at the way the Buddha was portrayed in the middle-class text books you studied (that is also how he was more or less portrayed during my period), it appears as though he &lt;em&gt;gave up&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;renounce&lt;/em&gt; all his desires. In other words, he became an &amp;lsquo;ascetic&amp;rsquo; man. Yet strangely enough, if we read about the Buddha&amp;rsquo;s road to enlightenment, we find something else: he did take to and practice asceticism, but, he says, it did not help him to get enlightened! That is, even though some people do practice asceticism and can get enlightened (after all, every path can lead to enlightenment), this was not the Buddha&amp;rsquo;s way. The Buddha, then, did not become enlightened by &amp;lsquo;giving up&amp;rsquo; his desires. Almost in a similar vein, Purandara Dasa also says in his &amp;ldquo;Eenu Maadidareenu Bhava Hingadu&amp;rdquo; that &amp;ldquo;punishing his body&amp;rdquo; did not help him.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the most common characteristics of the African culture is supposed to be its tribal nature. You could begin a study of &amp;lsquo;how&amp;rsquo; European intellectuals came to this characterization. It will have something to do with the way the Jews are differentiated internally, the novelty of what they confronted in Africa, and the inability to conceptualize what &amp;rsquo;tribes&amp;rsquo; really are. Such a research, which begins here in Europe, is likely to provide you with the initial questions that you need. Depending on the nature of these questions, you could gather the relevant data. Your hypothesis will be subject to one basic constraint: namely, it will have to provide an &amp;rsquo;explanation&amp;rsquo; (which is not ad hoc) about why the intellectuals in the West look at Africa in terms of tribes. And so on.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is ethics in India, but it is not normative ethics. It is a non-normative ethics. To get you going, consider acts like &amp;lsquo;generosity&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;kindness&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;bravery&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;friendliness&amp;rsquo; and such like. Often called &amp;lsquo;virtues&amp;rsquo;, these actions do not come under the scope of normative ethics. You cannot say: &amp;ldquo;one ought to be generous&amp;rdquo;, because generosity implies doing &amp;lsquo;more than&amp;rsquo; what is expected in the act of giving. Such notions are also called &amp;lsquo;supererogatory&amp;rsquo; in the literature, i.e. they are &amp;lsquo;over and beyond the call of duty&amp;rsquo;. This is one way to start coming to grips with the idea of non-normative ethics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How the Indians learn whatever they learn will be in accordance with their ways of going-about in the world.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The first question: could we have EIA of units smaller than the Cosmos?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An explanatorily intelligible account of any object, whatever that object is, is one where causal (say) and intentional explanations fall together. The causal account provides, let us say, an explanation that makes it clear what the causal antecedents of some object (or event, or phenomenon) are. (For the sake of this discussion, let us assume that theories in Natural Sciences provide us with explanations and that they are causal in nature.) The only kind of explanation we know that provides `meaning&amp;rsquo; (or reasons) for objects (or events, or phenomenon) are intentional ones: they postulate an agent; actions, objects and phenomena are seen to embody the intentions (beliefs, hopes, desires, designs, projects, etc.) of the agent. Such an explanation is an intentional explanation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The problem about translating &amp;lsquo;sruti&amp;rsquo; is not as easy as it has been made out to be. Is it possible to translate it as &amp;lsquo;revelation&amp;rsquo; or even as &amp;lsquo;divine revelation&amp;rsquo;? Because it has so far been translated in this manner, we can only conclude that it is indeed possible to do so. Next issue: how accurate is this translation? The answer to this question depends upon what &amp;lsquo;revelation&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;divine revelation&amp;rsquo; is supposed to mean.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Of course, the concept of explanatorily intelligible account is not easy to grasp: if it were, the &amp;lsquo;heathens&amp;rsquo; would not be &lt;em&gt;blind&lt;/em&gt; to the existence of religion. However, that does not mean we cannot grasp it either.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am glad you are beginning to see why the story about &amp;lsquo;Jesus as a Yogi&amp;rsquo; (Sankrant&amp;rsquo;s famous interpretation) is wrong; and why discussions on Sulekha drive me sometimes to despair and the believers (remember Gargoyle Minimus?) into utter rage. Why I keep saying that we &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; we understand Christianity (Pradip Gangopadhyay even claims that no Christian has understood the teachings of Christ, except himself), whereas we simply do not know what we are talking about.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;(I) In a Greek story, Persephone spends part of the year in the underworld and part of the year on earth, and winter is caused by her mother Demeter&amp;rsquo;s sorrow at parting, and spring by her mother&amp;rsquo;s joy at reuniting. When taken at face value, this story makes the change of seasons be because of someone&amp;rsquo;s emotions, and hence intelligible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Two points with respect to this. (a) I do not think that the story itself would say that winter and spring were &lt;em&gt;caused&lt;/em&gt; by the emotions of the mother. Instead, it would say: &amp;ldquo;her sorrow became, her joy became…&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;thus her sorrow is, her joy is…&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;that is how seasons came into being&amp;rdquo; or some such formulation. That is because, in my view, this story &lt;em&gt;does not&lt;/em&gt; portray causal or other relations between events. That is why it remains beautiful to this day. (b) Here, you are using &amp;lsquo;intelligibility&amp;rsquo; as &amp;lsquo;understandability&amp;rsquo;. Having or experiencing emotions is not seen as an &lt;em&gt;intentional&lt;/em&gt; state, i.e., not as a propositional attitude. &amp;lsquo;He is sad because his mother died&amp;rsquo; is glossed as &amp;lsquo;he believes that he is sad because his mother died&amp;rsquo;, or as &amp;lsquo;he is sad because he believes that his mother died&amp;rsquo;. (One indicator for testing the role played by the &amp;rsquo;that&amp;rsquo; clause is: the truth value of the entire sentence does not get affected by the truth value of the sentence occurring after the &amp;rsquo;that&amp;rsquo; clause. That is, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/intentional-operator-and-inconsistent-reasoning/&#34;&gt;&amp;rsquo;that&amp;rsquo; clause is not truth-functional&lt;/a&gt; unlike say &amp;lsquo;or&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;and&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;if…then&amp;rsquo; clauses.) It is important to emphasize that the notion of &amp;lsquo;intelligibility&amp;rsquo; requires that it is an expression of an intentional state and emotions are not seen as intentional states.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Intelligibility: Religion, Belief, Meaning</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by clarifying what the notion of intelligibility says.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first thing to keep in mind is that Religion &lt;em&gt;makes&lt;/em&gt; (i.e. transforms, renders, or any such synonym) the Cosmos (used interchangeably with &amp;rsquo;the world&amp;rsquo;, &amp;rsquo;the Universe&amp;rsquo;, etc) into an entity that is intelligible. In the process, and by virtue of it, the explanatory account makes &lt;em&gt;itself&lt;/em&gt; intelligible as well. That is, Religion is an explanatory intelligible account of both itself and the Cosmos.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why people resist to think critically?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have also come across expressions of similar thoughts and feelings both in India and in Europe and the United States. However, I think there are multiple grounds that generate such questions. Here are some I have been able to identify.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When people hear me say that the western intellectuals of the last three hundred years or more are completely wrong, invariably people skeptically wonder whether I think I am such a genius. Anticipating this (mostly) unexpressed question, I tell them that it is not a matter of psychology; I show that my theory answers the question (without making ad hoc assumptions) why the western intellectuals have been unable to see what I see. Even though they fall silent at this point, I suspect they do so not because they are convinced but because they do not know what else to say.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have come to accept that the most interesting facts that a theory explains are those of the theory itself. Furthermore, a &amp;rsquo;theory&amp;rsquo;, which collects all kinds of facts first and tries to &amp;rsquo;explain&amp;rsquo; them subsequently, is worse than having no theory. Such a theory is completely ad hoc and is cognitively uninteresting. It is pernicious too because it generates the belief that one understands such facts, when, in fact, all one has is an ad hoc explanation. In this sense, I have not collected evidence for the statement that &amp;lsquo;Indians accept European reports as descriptions of their world&amp;rsquo;; nor am I explaining these assembled facts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Irrespective of what Hindu kids are told we have, they will discover later that that all the beliefs they have heard and been taught about, everything about the Ten Commandments and the manifestations of the &amp;lsquo;brahman&amp;rsquo;, and so on are based on stories. They will discover too that these gods of their, these &amp;lsquo;manifestations&amp;rsquo; of Brahman, display immoral and disgusting behaviors: like incest, adultery, lying, cheating, murder, and so on and so forth. They will discover furthermore that there is no theology worth speaking of in the Indian traditions, and they will become one deeply ashamed Indian if they come across the Christian evangelicals or writers like the future Kripals or Courtrights. Their training (in Balvihar) will have set them up as an easy target for conversion into a Christianity or Islam (if (s)he remains &amp;lsquo;religious&amp;rsquo;).If not, they might grow up to loathe the tradition they are part of. They will not have been provided with the weapons they need in order to survive a theological discussion about the nature of &amp;lsquo;Hinduism&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many are concerned that English translations of some words from native languages distort their meaning. If we restrict ourselves to terms like &amp;lsquo;Deva&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;Dharma&amp;rsquo; and such like, the worry is not just that their translations distort the meaning of these words (as we use them in our native languages) but that they suggest something (by way of reference and meaning) that does not even exist in these languages.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With respect to some of these words, we can build a reasonable case in defense of this stance. That is because there is at least some theory about religion that we accept (however provisional or conditional such an acceptance might be) using which we can show that &amp;lsquo;Deva&amp;rsquo; cannot be translated as &amp;lsquo;God&amp;rsquo;. So far so good.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I do not have a theory of meaning. I do not know which of the many fragmentary theories of meaning I should choose from and why. Even though I acknowledge the importance of the topic, I do not feel called upon to do research on it. So far, I have been able to steer clear of the topic in &lt;em&gt;an interesting way&lt;/em&gt;: I am able to show that what appears as translation problem or a meaning problem (how should Sanskrit words be translated or the definition of &amp;lsquo;religion&amp;rsquo;, etc) is, at least in some instances, actually not that kind of a problem at all. Such an attitude has generated a psychological bonus for me: I do not go around criticizing Jeffrey Kripal for not knowing Bengali well enough, or for Wendy Doniger for not realizing that Dharma is not religion or that Brahmins are not priests, when my knowledge of either Bengali or Sanskrit does not match up to what they know.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Colonial consciousness incorporates the following element: in making statements about the colonized, the colonizer thinks that he is describing the colonizer. The latter, for his part, takes such statements as true descriptions of himself. What is involved is not the authority of the explainer (the colonizer) but the truth-value of the statements. How do we know this to be the case? Because we continue to think such statements are true even after &amp;lsquo;direct&amp;rsquo; colonization has ended.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the second half of the nineteenth century, some western-educated, Bombay intellectuals came together in the Prarthana Samaj (inspired by Keshub Sunder Sen of the Brahmo Samaj). Perhaps the best known members of the Prarthana Samaj were Mahadev Govind Ranada and Narayan Chandavarkar (the Vice-Chancellor of Bombay University). Both reformers advocated what they literally called &lt;em&gt;Hindu Protestantism&lt;/em&gt;. Below, I will present what I believe to be illustrations of the distortion that occurs when these intellectuals talk about reform.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What Aristotle is doing in my piece on the Indian traditions? He is doing many things actually.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;His presence is a continuation of my argument that the Antiquity (Greeks and the Romans) is not the cradle of western culture and civilization.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Aristotelian &amp;lsquo;Eudemonia&amp;rsquo; is my way of explaining his thought to the western public, which thinks that it understands Aristotle.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is a greater similarity between his notion of happiness and our notions of enlightenment than there is between him and the Christian notions of bliss.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What is ethical about pursuit of happiness (Ananda)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here is what I say in my article on &amp;lsquo;how to speak for the Indian traditions&amp;rsquo;: &amp;ldquo;Our middle-aged man is, thus, raising the question of Aristotle.&amp;ldquo;I have pursued many things in life. I have acquired wealth and status, and aimed with varying degrees of success to become powerful and famous. I have been successful in some of my endeavors, while failing in yet others. I thought these things would make me happy, but I discover that, apart from moments when I felt &amp;lsquo;good&amp;rsquo;, these projects have only made me unhappy. What should I do? How should I live?&amp;rdquo; Today, these questions are not a part of ethical enquiry, any more than a quest for eudemonia is: at best, these are the &amp;rsquo;esoteric&amp;rsquo; questions and quests of &amp;rsquo;exotic&amp;rsquo; religions; at worst, one raises them with one&amp;rsquo;s psychoanalyst during a &amp;lsquo;mid-life crisis&amp;rsquo;. This situation should already indicate the distance between what is called an &amp;rsquo;ethical enquiry&amp;rsquo; today, and what Aristotle thought was the subject of all such enquiries. But that is not the focus of this piece now. However, there is no need to confuse matters by continually drawing the distinction between &amp;lsquo;modern&amp;rsquo; ethics and &amp;lsquo;Aristotelian&amp;rsquo; ethics. So, let us follow the contemporary consensus and call the quest of our middle-aged man &amp;lsquo;spiritual&amp;rsquo; (from now on without scare quotes). Seeking spirituality, and not having found it in those objects that he once so passionately pursued, he is now raising a spiritual question: in fact, he is undergoing a spiritual crisis.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If we want to speak about the meaning of human existence, at least one condition has to be met: such an existence (from birth to death at least) must embody a plan or a reason. Such a plan or reason cannot be that of the individual in question for the simple reason that his/her birth (at the least, not to speak of the first years of his/her existence) does not instantiate any of his/her plans. Only in such cases could we say that the human existence has meaning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In &amp;ldquo;An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals&amp;rdquo;, David Hume, the philosopher of the Scottish Enlightenment, raises a question, which has always been one of the basic concerns of ethical investigations in the modern western intellectual tradition: what theory of morals could serve any useful purpose, he asks, unless it can be shown that all the duties it recommends are also in the true interest of each individual? Even though there are several interesting things about this question, I will just indicate two of them. Firstly, the belief is that an individual requires reasons to behave morally which is what a theory of morals is supposed to provide. Secondly, he requires reasons to be moral because moral rules constrain his actions. Since it is rational that each individual pursues his &amp;lsquo;own&amp;rsquo; interests, any constraint placed on his behavior requires some kind of justification. Together, these two assumptions yield us the better-known question in ethical theorizing: is it rational to be moral? Or, more imply put in terms of an even older question: why ought we to be moral?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ever since the German Romantics, another thought, which reverses the above question, is also a part of the modern-day consciousness: is it moral to be rational? However, the elaboration of this question is not only implicit but it is also confined mostly to a criticism of local rationalities: the economic rationality, the technological rationality, the scientific rationality, the rationality of progress, etc. The reversal is only implicit and the criticisms only local because even where some person formulates criticisms of (some such) rationality in some domain or the other, there the same individual chooses to be rational in other fields of human endeavor. Of course, there is nothing wrong with this attitude: we are rightly afraid of obscurantist rejections of rationality. However, the problems are these: of what kind of rationality ought we to be critical? That is to say, when are we morally obliged to criticize rationality? What kind of rationality is susceptible to such a moral criticism?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While translating Russell L. Ackoff, you say that such a translation is &amp;ldquo;not a moral judgment now, but a statement about the state of the economy&amp;rdquo;. But your claim, according to Ackoff&amp;rsquo;s own argument, is untrue.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Consider how he describes corruption: &amp;ldquo;We concluded that corruption occurs when one party, A (for example, a policeman), who has an obligation to a second party, B (for example, the government), to provide service to a third party, C (for example, a member of the public), serves C in such a way as to benefit A more than he or she is supposed to. In addition, anyone who induces another to behave corruptly is corrupt. Therefore, corruption is the exploitation for one&amp;rsquo;s personal benefit of a position in which one is expected to serve others.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;B (the policeman) has an obligation to serve C (a member of the public) and this obligation is a moral obligation; A has a derived moral obligation to serve C because A is under the moral obligation to do what B (the government) expects him to. A violates his moral obligation to B because as a part of B, he serves C in such a way that A benefits more, that is, A&amp;rsquo;s (moral) abuse of his position makes him receive more benefits than he morally deserves. (What A deserves by virtue is serving C is a moral reward.) In this sense, Ackoff is making a moral claim.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was invited by some Sadhus from Swami Narayan Temple (BAPS) to visit the temple and have a discussion with them. Because they practice very strict Brahmacharya (eight types of avoiding women, each correlated to an organ: it is called Ashtanga Brahmacharya), the Sadhus said that women could not be present during our discussions, while they were welcome to visit the temple. As I remember the incident, my female students were a bit &amp;lsquo;upset&amp;rsquo; (hurt, insulted, indignant, or whatever) that the Sadhus were not able to meet them and felt &lt;strong&gt;discriminated against&lt;/strong&gt; by virtue of their sex. A few years later, one of my teachers from Belgium visited another wing of the Swami Narayan people and found that &amp;lsquo;women were discriminated against&amp;rsquo; because they were allowed only to come some distance from the temple when the Sadhus were present. In both cases, I was puzzled by their reaction: I explained that the action of the Sadhus should not be seen as an act of discrimination against women but as an expression of the strict Brahmacharya that the Sadhus practiced. The question here is: why did these people (my students and my teacher) experience &amp;lsquo;discrimination&amp;rsquo;, where I saw none and also knew that none was intended?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ideas have impact on people. Theological dilemmas have impact on those who formulate such dilemmas and on the future generations. They undertake actions (of whatever type) to solve these dilemmas, where and when these people find such dilemmas important. In this way, one can make some sense of the claim that Christological dilemma propels Christianity forward. However, this explanation cannot (at the stage our knowledge is in) be incorporated into a historical explanation: was Thomas Aquinas responding to the state of theology during his time, or was he a fame-hungry man who wrote his Summa Theologica in order to become famous, or was he afflicted by a rare disease?.? In other words, if we try to explain why St. Thomas wrote Summa, there are so many possibilities that a selection of any one possibility becomes a matter of taste and of one&amp;rsquo;s pet theory. Moreover, even then, such a selection fails to tell us much about western history. Consequently, such an explanation cannot become a part of historical explanation, if the idea is to make history intelligible and coherent.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Question: why religion spreads among (some) human beings? What is it about them that enables the transmission of religion?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This issue allows multiple answers. In this post, I would like to focus on the simplest answer to the question. In my theory, I presuppose an answer to the question: I assume that there is something in our constitution that allows religion to spread among human beings. The issue now is: why do I presuppose it, i.e. assume this state of affairs as a fact?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We have developed partial explanations of why the secularism debate in India takes such peculiar forms and why otherwise intelligent people talk nonsense here. But we don&amp;rsquo;t do so by pegging our use of the word secularism &amp;ldquo;onto Balu&amp;rsquo;s theory about the nature of religion and how that entity religion behaves in the world&amp;rdquo; and then expecting that other people do the same.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let me quickly repeat our argument: Concepts like religion and secularism and principles of the secular state developed in Europe against the background of larger conceptual frameworks. Broadly speaking, one knew what &lt;code&gt;religion&#39; and &#39;the secular state&#39; referred to or what the separation of &lt;/code&gt;the religious&amp;rsquo; and `the political&amp;rsquo; amounted to, because these terms were embedded in such a common background framework. Naturally, there were many different positions and discontinuities in the debates. But disagreements about the precise meaning of terms or clashes between conflicting normative positions made sense to the participants, precisely because they occurred against the background of this type of framework. The framework put semantic limits on the potential interpretation of terms and principles, as it related concepts to each other in particular systematic ways. This background framework reflects not only generic Christian theology and political theory, but also the common cultural and historical experience of Europeans.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I want to go deeper into the claim of &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/meanings-and-historical-context-the-arguments-from-indian-scholars-%e2%80%93s-n-balagangadhara/&#34; title=&#34;Meanings and Historical Context: the arguments from Indian scholars –S.N.Balagangadhara&#34;&gt;my earlier post&lt;/a&gt; that Shabnum Tejanis and Neera Chandhokes of this world do not think but merely talk. In other words, is it possible to identify the problems with their accounts (that explicates more clearly why I say that they do not think) in such a way that it is susceptible to some sort of solution? If, indeed, we can show that such people do not think and we can show that their mistakes have some cognitive roots, then we can also provide additional explanations. In such a case, our answer would be richer and more complex than any other available at the market place.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Indian Americans and Identity Politics</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We do not have any clear explanation of the nature and rise of American identity politics as yet. But here are a few speculative intuitions:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Identity politics seems to be the way in which the dominant culture in America compels other cultural communities to become variants of itself. It sustains a basic model of society which neutralizes groups that challenge the dominant culture by making them into cultural ghettos. As such, these groups can demand recognition of their distinct identity and fight for a just representation in education. But they can do so only within the conceptual limits fixed by the dominant culture. In this way, the other cultural communities are straitjacketed into the basic cultural structure of American society. This basic structure somehow reflects the mechanisms through which Christianity has always transformed the nonwestern cultures into variants of itself. As such, American society and its identity politics are secularized Christianity embodied in a socio-political model.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Vacuity of NRIs and their symbolic interpretations</title>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Vyasa&amp;rsquo;s argument (to the extent we can speak of an argument in this context) is quite subtle: When Urvasi comes to Arjuna at the behest of his father, and when she is possessed by desire, and when the Apsaras choose freely and unconfined, then (a) one cannot reject her; (b) and with the argument that she is a superior to him. If you split this conjunction and cast in normative terms, it says something like this: (a) Rejection of a woman is not permitted when one&amp;rsquo;s father indicates that a son should sleep with a woman; (b) Rejection of a woman is not permitted when the woman is sexually attracted to oneself; (c) Rejection of a woman, whoever she might be, is not permitted when she chooses freely and without confines. Because such a rejection is triply prohibited (or forbidden), Arjuna&amp;rsquo;s argument that he &amp;lsquo;ought not&amp;rsquo; to sleep with the parent of his race (which has only one prohibition) possesses less value. So, Urvasi is justified in her curse of Arjuna. In other words, if we read this fragment of Mahabharata in normative terms, Arjuna was wrong in not having an incestuous relationship with one of his great-great-grandparents.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1&amp;rsquo;. While one could argue that one &amp;lsquo;ought not&amp;rsquo; to sleep with the &amp;lsquo;superiors&amp;rsquo;, Urvasi suggests that because she has chosen freely, this argument is void. On top of saying why Arjuna is wrong to reject sleeping with her, she also comes up with two other reasons why he could sleep with her: (a) Arjuna&amp;rsquo;s ancestors have done so and without committing any &amp;lsquo;sin&amp;rsquo;; therefore, it is &amp;lsquo;permissible&amp;rsquo; that he does the same; (b)  it is a morally good thing to emulate one&amp;rsquo;s ancestors and therefore Arjuna &amp;lsquo;ought to&amp;rsquo; sleep with her.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Indian culture’s attitude toward sex vs. Christian Morality</title>
      <link>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/indian-cultures-attitude-toward-sex-vs-christian-morality/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Let us begin with the assumption that our stories about Indra and the Gandharvas are just that: stories, authored by human beings, without truth-content. (That is to say, they are neither true nor false.) When human beings write stories, their imagination is (partially) constrained by their societies, cultures and the times they live in. None quite knows how exactly the latter constrain human imagination even though the extant theories about myths try to explicate this relation: some see in them a mirroring of society, some see in them a disguised historiography or sociology, some see in them a personification of virtues, and so on. Because this issue is not settled yet, I shall presuppose the truth of none of the theories about myths that dot the landscape. However, I take the &amp;lsquo;constraint&amp;rsquo; I spoke about to incorporate the following minimal claim: the myths suggest that some attitudes fall within the limits (or transgress them, as the case may be) of the cultures whose myths they are. Under this assumption, let me isolate some of the attitudes that come to the fore if we look at our stories about apsaras.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Contrast sets have multiple functions depending on the contexts in which they are used. For instance, in the case of theories about some phenomena, they can be used to test the robustness of the theories: why do unsupported objects on earth fall downwards instead of floating? Why did the Primitive Man invent &amp;lsquo;religion&amp;rsquo; instead of doing any number of other things he could have done? And so on. In such cases, one might be looking for reasons to accept an explanation temporarily or one might even be comparing rival explanations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;X says: &amp;ldquo;Modern prostitution is a very specific institution with the features of pimps, forced sex, kidnapped women, drug addicted women, immigrants lured to foreign shores on false pretences, and so on. If we insist on precision in ideas, then it is counterproductive to confuse matters by calling Apsaras prostitutes without first showing that at least some of the above conditions hold true and there is some structural similarity.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, &amp;lsquo;modern&amp;rsquo; prostitution is all these things and more. However, I did not claim anywhere that Apsaras are &amp;lsquo;modern&amp;rsquo; prostitutes in any sense of the word. Nor did I suggest that there was &amp;lsquo;institutionalized prostitution&amp;rsquo; in India or that our stories suggest that there is such an institution in &amp;lsquo;Swarga&amp;rsquo;. The whole discussion is about a single sentence and I responded by laying out my reasons to call Apsaras as &amp;lsquo;prostitutes in the court of Indra&amp;rsquo;. To say today what I thought was evident (&amp;rsquo;evident&amp;rsquo; because that is what I learned as a child), I do not need to have any kind of a specific theory about &amp;lsquo;modern prostitution&amp;rsquo; or even one about what &amp;lsquo;prostitution&amp;rsquo; generally is about.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Christian theology and linguistic intuitions: prostitute</title>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In so far as the suggestion is that the English word &amp;lsquo;prostitute&amp;rsquo; does not capture the connotations of the earlier uses of &amp;lsquo;Veshya&amp;rsquo;, as I said, I agree with all of you. In this sense, if you further suggest that &amp;lsquo;Apsara&amp;rsquo; should not be considered as a synonym for &amp;lsquo;prostitute&amp;rsquo;, I would also agree. I do not suggest that &amp;lsquo;apsara&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;prostitute&amp;rsquo; are synonyms: for two words to be synonymous in this context, we need that both words refer to one and the same set of objects. This cannot be the case here because &amp;lsquo;apsara&amp;rsquo; picks out only non-human entities, whereas &amp;lsquo;prostitute&amp;rsquo; can also refer to human beings. I would also be grateful if anyone has a better suggestion for translating &amp;lsquo;Veshya&amp;rsquo;. As I said in an earlier post,&amp;lsquo;courtesan&amp;rsquo; is an alternative. However, a &amp;lsquo;courtesan&amp;rsquo; is also a prostitute, whatever else she is. On this, linguistic part, there are no disagreements.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Colonial Consciousness and Victorian Morality</title>
      <link>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/colonial-consciousness-and-victorian-morality/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 23 Mar 2011 06:13:53 +0530</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/colonial-consciousness-and-victorian-morality/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You suggest that calling Apsaras as &amp;ldquo;prostitutes in the court of Indra&amp;rdquo; is an extreme statement. Of course, you would be right if you mean that the English word does not carry all the connotations of &amp;lsquo;Veshya&amp;rsquo; or even that our current usage of the word &amp;lsquo;Veshya&amp;rsquo; is not as rich as the earlier uses of the same word were. You are right too when you point out that the word &amp;lsquo;Kama&amp;rsquo;, as a pursushartha, embraces a bigger set than sexual pleasure or romantic love. Perhaps, one might prefer the word &amp;lsquo;courtesan&amp;rsquo; to &amp;lsquo;prostitute&amp;rsquo; but that distorts the Indian &amp;lsquo;Veshya&amp;rsquo; too: a courtesan was either a mistress of the wealthy or a prostitute who entertained only the rich. However, I am not sure whether my claim is really that extreme (with the proviso that we keep in mind the current-day changes in the meanings of the words in both English and Indian languages). Let me explain why.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When we read, say, Kamasutra, we discover that prostitutes had to be cultured and learned human beings; they were supposed to be proficient in multiple arts including music, poetry, dance, handicrafts and so on. &amp;lsquo;Treating the prostitutes humanely&amp;rsquo; includes teaching these skills to them: after all, many of the arts they practiced to entertain men requires teaching and learning. This suggests that a teacher could take prostitutes as his/her students and that the society did not disapprove. Instead, it countenanced such teaching. However, this is not all there is to the story. Consider the fact that a prostitute is also called &amp;rsquo;nitya sumangali&amp;rsquo;: one who can never become a widow. As you know, the word &amp;lsquo;sumangali&amp;rsquo; is not usedlightly in India and it carries a very positive connotation as is also indexed by the use of &amp;lsquo;su&amp;rsquo;. (Of course, one uses this term also sarcastically in colloquial language but such use does not take away the positive connotation.) Even though the prostitute never marries, our traditions did not withhold the appellation &amp;lsquo;sumangali&amp;rsquo; from her. Consider too, in this context, the &amp;lsquo;good qualities&amp;rsquo; of a wife: &amp;lsquo;Karyeshu dasi, Karaneshu mantri&amp;hellip;.&amp;rsquo; As this verse (I have forgotten both its source and how it ends) continues, it appears that a wife should also be &amp;lsquo;shayaneshu veshya&amp;rsquo; (a prostitute in bed). Quite independent of the conjectures we can make about its anti-feministic character or whatever, think about what this verse is suggesting: the wife should behave like a prostitute in the bedroom. What does that mean? Whether or not it also means that she should entertain her husband through music, recitation of poetry, dance and such like, one thing is clear: she must be well-versed in sexual matters. Step back for a moment and ask yourself how any girl could be well-versed (better than her husband, in fact) in sexual matters. There are only two possibilities: either the girl had a lot of experience in sex before marriage (there goes the idea of virginity of one&amp;rsquo;s wife) or she was trained and educated in the art of sex in her family. Irrespective of which of the possibilities is true, this verse indicates at least two things: being a prostitute did not make one immoral anymore than visiting a prostitute made one immoral. The prostitute had qualities which a &amp;lsquo;good wife&amp;rsquo; should emulate. Note that these qualities are not those that prostitutes also have; the wife is supposed to have those qualities that make a woman into a prostitute (&amp;lsquo;shayaneshu veshya&amp;rsquo;).  Furthermore, in so far as women were taught the &amp;lsquo;art of loving&amp;rsquo; (kama-sutra) in their families, surely, it tells us that the reaction of the middle class in India today is anything but Indian: it is an inherited prudishness drawn from the Victorian morality. It is in this sense that I suggested that the Indians are not prudes in matters of sexuality. In this sense too, in this Indian sense, Apsaras, I claim, are &amp;ldquo;prostitutes in the court of Indra&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Victorian morality of NRI and middle class Hindus: Prostitution, Adultery</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;1.1. The Indian traditions did not have the same attitude as Christianity towards prostitution or adultery. And the Indians of yesteryears were not defenders of the Victorian (and Christian) morality. Of course, I approvingly said that the &amp;ldquo;Indians are not prudes&amp;rdquo; but this approval has to do with the thrust of Indian thought, as I have understood it: the impossibility of prohibiting or making obligatory some or another action universally. (This is my formulation, of course.) I do believe that the Indians recognized the impossibility of abolishing prostitution (which is why it is called &amp;ldquo;the oldest profession&amp;rdquo;). Instead, therefore, of banning and condemning prostitution (and subsequently turn a blind eye towards its existence), Indian thinkers suggested that we treat the prostitutes humanely. I have never been to a prostitute nor will I ever go to one; but that does not mean that I want to ignore their existence and treat them as non-humans. Nor am I willing to call all those who visit prostitutes as criminals and perverts. I know of too many lonely men and women who have found human warmth and personal comfort in the arms and companionship of prostitutes to consider them as perverts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Let me invite you to do a thought-experiment along with me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Imagine that all human beings seek happiness. Imagine too that they can all achieve this state of being. Because, as I said in one of my posts, there are no qualifications (or requirements) to reach this end-state; any and all ways are conducive to reach this end-state: thinking, meditation, music, dance, and, yes, even going to temples and reciting &amp;lsquo;sahasranaamams.&amp;rsquo; At any and every stage and moment, people can achieve happiness.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I think there is a simpler answer to why we do not eat beef: &amp;ldquo;we do not see it as food.&amp;rdquo; In the same way people in the Nazi concentration camps and the Ethiopians during the famine did not see fellow human beings as edible items, we do not see cows as food. (Contrast this with the story of a plane crash in the Andes Mountain some three decades ago, where the dead were cannibalized by the living in order to survive.) Culture, upbringing and even beliefs (in the case of some people) could help explain this situation. The central point, however, is that we do not see it as food.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Traditions are inherited practices, which mean two things: they are both transmitted and learnt. The learning occurs through imitation, following instructions, through stories and so on. Consequently, traditions &amp;lsquo;change&amp;rsquo; (i.e. undergo modifications) even as they are being transmitted and learnt. This makes traditions flexible and adaptive.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Human practices conserve, that is, we do not go around inventing new practices every day. In this sense, traditions are essentially conserving in their nature. This is one of the reasons why we see &amp;lsquo;being traditional&amp;rsquo; as `being conservative&amp;rsquo; as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Are stories symbols?</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/are-stories-symbols/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;1. Here is one way of looking at what stories are. They are symbols. What are they symbols of? Well, they could symbolize acts; they could also be symbolically interpreted as justifications of such acts. Under this construal, a story requires an interpretation: one has to interpret the story as a symbol of either an act or as its symbolic justification. (The same applies to looking at stories as symbols of values. The stories, for instance, could be seen to symbolize virtues. Stories could also symbolize passions, feelings, natural forces&amp;hellip;) Then, stories are mostly, if not always, symbols of something or another. When you look at the issue this way, it is almost akin to saying that stories are &amp;ldquo;evidences&amp;rdquo; of sorts: some story or another provides &amp;ldquo;evidence&amp;rdquo; about the presence of &amp;ldquo;something else&amp;rdquo;. (Let us leave aside the issue of what it means to talk of a symbol in all these contexts or what &amp;ldquo;evidence&amp;rdquo; means here. Both terms can be understood in a vague sense for our purposes.) In another language, we can say that all stories are signs. These signs must be turned into signifiers (this requires an act of interpretation) by showing or suggesting that they signify &amp;ldquo;something else&amp;rdquo; (called the signified).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A science of cultures is not Atmagyaana or Brahmagyaana. Let me also add that I find a quest for happiness a normal human striving.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;According to the Indian traditions, experience itself is a state of being: anubhava. In my story, so is happiness (or atmasaakshaatkaara). Need one be enlightened in order to speak about enlightenment? Should that be the case, one cannot strive for enlightenment at all and I think that enlightenment (or happiness) is a legitimate goal for human beings. If happiness is not an esoteric state of being but a legitimate goal for all human beings, there are indefinitely many roads to that state of being. The strength of the Indian traditions lies not merely in recognizing this but also in working out many such routes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let us begin with the idea that religion is some kind of a system (or structure or whatever you feel like using) that maintains itself. That is to say, it is able to reproduce itself, and sustain itself. I call this the `simple reproduction&amp;rsquo; of religion. This dynamic enables not only the reproduction of the community of believers but also the experiential intelligibility that the Cosmos has for them. (Worship, for instance, is one such means for the reproduction of religion.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are other normative statements besides ethical ones: even aesthetic statements are normative (when you judge something to be ugly or beautiful) or statements about the presence of other values (say, &amp;rsquo;the meaning of life&amp;rsquo; questions). I have never denied it. As you rightly point out, legal norms are normative but they are not co-extensive with the ethical ones.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If there are standards to measure some entity or phenomenon and that such measurements are not &amp;ldquo;necessarily normative&amp;rdquo;, of course, you are right. We can say whether a car has been properly assembled by referring to the standards of putting the parts of the car together; we can say that rice has been adulterated or even that storm has a strength measured by the Beaufort scale. None of these is normative. I am not claiming that &amp;lsquo;all&amp;rsquo; measurements (or evaluations) are normative.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Normativity as ‘parasitic’ behavior</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We need to tackle the following issues properly if we want to get a handle on normativity and its relation to a configuration of learning.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1.1. Normativity cannot be the product of ethical learning. If it were that, say, by being a biological inheritance, then normative thinking would be the form of all ethics and my claim is that it is not so.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1.2. Nevertheless, we need to explain the success of the normative mode of thinking. That is, almost all aspects of human existence appear susceptible to the process of &amp;rsquo;norming&amp;rsquo; and this process is also capable of expressing our ethical judgments about issues. This suggests that normativity exemplifies a &amp;lsquo;parasitic&amp;rsquo; behavior: it can infect different learning process and their products. Put differently: it is capable of piggybacking upon different learning processes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I still have some difficulty in figuring out the problem about normative ethics expressed on the Abhinavagupta forum. There is obviously something that bugs people, but I cannot make out what it is.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, about the counter evidence. If the Indian film censor board is a statutory body, then it derives its powers from the laws that have brought such an entity into being. Its tasks (viz. whether it is an advisory organ or can enforce its decisions, for instance) would be defined by the laws that govern such an entity and the same laws should also make it clear what &amp;lsquo;obscenity&amp;rsquo; is. (Assuming that such an entity has the task of censoring &amp;lsquo;obscenity&amp;rsquo;.) Establishing such an entity tells us something about the conceptions regarding the state and underlying such conceptions would be some normative doctrine about the relation between the state and citizens. (For instance it could be about the state guarding the &amp;lsquo;public morality&amp;rsquo; or the educative role of the state or whatever else.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;X asks: I am unable to figure out what the special significance is of not having a &amp;lsquo;moral ought&amp;rsquo; in the Indian traditions. If &amp;lsquo;should not&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;must not&amp;rsquo; have the same practical consequences as &amp;lsquo;ought not&amp;rsquo;, that is we are obligated to behave in a certain way, why does it make a difference how it is expressed in our language?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Your question is probably the best way of showing the difficulty we have with normative thinking. That is one of conceptualizing something called a normative ethical domain. Let us see if a simple (and simplistic) answer will help. Consider:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Whenever I discuss the absence of normative ethics in India, people, especially Indians, get agitated. They hear me say that India has no ethics. Consequently, they want to show that I could never be right in my claim. This has happened on the Abhinavagupta forum as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps, I should say that the Indian understanding of ethics is different from the western understanding. While this might prevent a knee-jerk reflex, it is not quite so informative.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My proposal addresses itself to the following observation: the natural sciences, &lt;em&gt;as we know them today&lt;/em&gt;, arise in the western culture. What &amp;rsquo;natural sciences&amp;rsquo; mean in the above statement is clarified by other sentences that say, for example, &amp;rsquo;the rest of the world has accepted the western science and technology..&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;we need to learn science and technology form the west..&amp;rsquo; When we make these kinds of statements, what do we have in mind? Do we suggest that we need to learn some scientific formula from the west, or that we have to learn the proof of a theorem from the west? We do not. We are looking at sciences at a different level of abstraction. We are suggesting that there is a &lt;em&gt;way of going about the world&lt;/em&gt; that we need to learn from the west. My hypothesis about science and religion is pitched at this level of abstraction. That is to say, I answer the following question: in which way is the growth of sciences a cultural phenomenon?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The absence of supernatural entities in Indian traditions</title>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The absence of supernatural entities in the Indian traditions may seem counterintuitive to many. We can let someone else do the talking for us, namely Dale B. Martin in his interesting book &lt;em&gt;Inventing Superstition: from the Hippocratics to the Christians&lt;/em&gt; (Harvard University Press, 2004):&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;One of the basic arguments of this book is that, contrary to many modern assumptions, the category of &amp;ldquo;the supernatural&amp;rdquo; did not exist in ancient culture &lt;em&gt;as&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;a category&lt;/em&gt;. Neither popular notions, held by the vast majority of inhabitants of the ancient world, nor philosophical notions (we could say &amp;ldquo;scientific&amp;rdquo; with due consideration for the possible anachronistic connotations of the term) assumed that reality was split up into two realms, one &amp;ldquo;natural,&amp;rdquo; containing things like &amp;ldquo;matter&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;natural forces&amp;rdquo; such as gravity or electricity, and another &amp;ldquo;supernatural,&amp;rdquo; to which gods and similar beings (demigods, angels, demons, ghosts) could be assigned&amp;hellip; What is important for this post is that the category was not available, either explicitly or by assumption, for persons in the classical Greek and Roman worlds. The Greeks and Romans certainly had no &lt;em&gt;word&lt;/em&gt; that was equivalent to the modern English &amp;ldquo;supernatural.&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip;I do not, however, want just to quibble about words. Classical Greeks and Latin had not term for what passes in the modern world as &amp;ldquo;the supernatural&amp;rdquo; precisely because the ancients did not separate out divine forces and beings from &amp;ldquo;nature&amp;rdquo; and relegate them to a separate ontological realm that could designated by its own label. Generally, for ancient people whatever does exist exists in &amp;ldquo;nature.&amp;rdquo; Almost without exception the Greek term &lt;em&gt;physis&lt;/em&gt; (nature) refers to &amp;ldquo;all that is.&amp;rdquo; People might argue that the gods did not exist or that some particular daimon or god or superhuman being did not exist (I know of no ancient author who argued for actual atheism in the modern sense). But in that case, they said that the disputed entity simply did not exist, not that it might exist in some other realm of reality, such as the &amp;ldquo;supernatural.&amp;rdquo; Ancient philosophers might argue that lightning was not caused by a god, but they did not do so by pointing out that lightning occurs in the &amp;ldquo;natural&amp;rdquo; realm and that the gods exist in the &amp;ldquo;supernatural&amp;rdquo; realm and that the two realms are not supposed to interact with one another. Ancient people took the gods and all other beings we would think of as &amp;ldquo;supernatural&amp;rdquo; to be &lt;em&gt;part&lt;/em&gt; of nature if they existed at all.&amp;rdquo; (pp. 13-15)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What is Anubhava? III</title>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let us retain the translation of &amp;lsquo;Anu&amp;rsquo; as &amp;lsquo;appropriate&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;apt&amp;rsquo;. Let us emphasize the active dimension of the word &amp;lsquo;Bhava&amp;rsquo; to translate it as &amp;lsquo;coming into existence&amp;rsquo;. (&amp;lsquo;Existence&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;being&amp;rsquo; are also acceptable translations of the word &amp;lsquo;Bhava&amp;rsquo;.) Then &amp;lsquo;Anubhava&amp;rsquo; would mean an apt way of coming-into-existence. The problem here is this: we can ask the question, &lt;em&gt;coming into existence of what?&lt;/em&gt; Of course, we can answer it easily by using hyphenation: it is not the coming-into-existence of any &amp;rsquo;thing&amp;rsquo; but coming-into &amp;rsquo;existence&amp;rsquo;. However, this might create more confusion than it solves. So, let us make a compromise here for the sake of clarity: coming-into-existence-of-being. We can also shorten it as coming-into-being, where we understand &amp;lsquo;being&amp;rsquo; as &amp;lsquo;origin&amp;rsquo;. We come into existence, we originate. In this sense, &amp;lsquo;Anubhava&amp;rsquo; talks about &amp;ldquo;an appropriate originating&amp;rdquo;. (This is all heavy-duty philosophy stuff, this is what &amp;lsquo;ontology&amp;rsquo; is, the &amp;lsquo;doctrine of being&amp;rsquo;.) As long as we keep these ideas in mind, we can say that &amp;lsquo;bhava&amp;rsquo; can be translated also as &amp;lsquo;being-there-in the world&amp;rsquo;, or as &amp;lsquo;being present in the world&amp;rsquo;. Thus, &amp;lsquo;anubhava&amp;rsquo;, or experience, is &amp;lsquo;being appropriately present in the world&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;being aptly present in the world&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What is experience? I</title>
      <link>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/what-is-experience-iii/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/what-is-experience-iii/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The biggest issue is: what is experience? All the Indian traditions have been busy with answering this question. But both posing this question and answering it are themselves experiential, as far as the Indian traditions are concerned. For instance, according to the so-called Buddhist traditions, the structures-in-experience are not given in the experience itself: the impermanence and transience of experience has to do with the realization that the description of the experience provides a sense of permanence because all descriptions of experience &amp;lsquo;create&amp;rsquo; structures. Here, it has to do with structures like &amp;lsquo;self&amp;rsquo;, specific emotions, and such like. But that does not mean that the Buddhist tradition says that our &amp;rsquo;experience&amp;rsquo; of a tree, or a stone or a car, etc. is illusory. That is, they do not say that the &amp;rsquo;experience&amp;rsquo; of the external world is an illusion.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If we take our English language use as a reference point, it appears as though we can speak sensibly about experiencing our feelings (&amp;lsquo;I experience sadness&amp;rsquo;), experiencing thoughts (&amp;lsquo;I can even now experience my jumbled thoughts when &amp;hellip;&amp;rsquo;), experiencing colour (&amp;lsquo;I experience a redness&amp;rsquo;), experiencing actions (&amp;lsquo;I still experience my shaking limbs when I&amp;hellip;&amp;rsquo;) and so on. That is, we can experience the &amp;lsquo;inputs&amp;rsquo; of all our five senses. From this, it follows that experience &lt;em&gt;cannot be&lt;/em&gt; identical to any of them. Experience might contain, as its elements, inputs from these five senses in the form of thoughts, feelings, sensations, etc. but it cannot be coextensive with any one of them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/what-is-experience-i/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;1.1. Let us begin with the word &amp;ldquo;Anubhava&amp;rdquo;, which we use to translate the English word &amp;ldquo;experience&amp;rdquo;. There are two sub-words here: Anu and Bhava. &amp;lsquo;Anu&amp;rsquo; can be translated as &amp;lsquo;apt&amp;rsquo;, or &amp;lsquo;appropriate&amp;rsquo;, whereas &amp;lsquo;Bhava&amp;rsquo; can be rendered as &amp;rsquo;existence&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;being&amp;rsquo;. (The word also has an active dimension of &amp;lsquo;becoming&amp;rsquo; as one of its meanings.) So, &amp;lsquo;anubhava&amp;rsquo; would mean having an appropriate existence or even an appropriate way of being-in-the-world. Appropriate to what though? Appropriate to the things, events, and the people one meets in the world. So, &amp;rsquo;experience&amp;rsquo; means a way of being present in the world that is appropriate to whatever one encounters in the world. It is, if you like, &amp;lsquo;being-present-with&amp;rsquo;. This means that we need time: to discover ways that are appropriate to the different things we relate to in the world, we have to take our time to get to know them. That is to say, if one wants to experience the world, one has to take the time, have patience and be there. In short, &amp;rsquo;experience&amp;rsquo; indicates a stance or an attitude we assume in the world with respect to whatever we encounter (think, taste, perceive, hear, feel, touch) in the world. Experience, thus, includes sensations, perceptions, feelings, thoughts etc but is not co-extensive with any of them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;According to your account, Vedanta claims that the &lt;em&gt;world is an illusion&lt;/em&gt; and that only the Brahman is real.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the world is an illusion, Vedanta has to deny the reality of the world. To it, in the way you construe Vedanta, the world &lt;em&gt;is the empty set&lt;/em&gt;. That is to say, all experiences are on par because they are all illusions. One cannot distinguish between experiences unless one introduces the notion of a differentiated reality. From this, it follows that a vedantin should not be able to discriminate, say, between the following: the pain you have by stubbing your toe, the pain you have when your arm is cut off without anaesthesia, and the pain you feel when your loved one dies. If he does draw a distinction between them, he is distinguishing one illusion from the other and the only way of doing that is to ascribe to these illusions the status of reality: this is &amp;rsquo;less illusory&amp;rsquo; than… this is &amp;lsquo;more real&amp;rsquo; than… this &amp;lsquo;pains more than&amp;rsquo;… this pain is &amp;lsquo;different from&amp;rsquo;…and so on. If he does not distinguish, and insists there is no difference between falling in a lake and bumping his head against a tree, who would take him seriously? Do you believe that Indians are such cretins that they would simply accept such inane stories? Surely, if &amp;lsquo;Brahman&amp;rsquo; is all there is to Vedanta, all vedantins must be perfect imbeciles. In that case, we do not need heavy-duty tantric stuff to shoot them down; a simple dose of commonsense will do.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

If we could arrive at something approximating a consensus, we will have made a substantial headway. At the least, we can critically read the material on Hinduism with our answers to these questions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I suggest we begin with (a). To start the ball rolling, I will mention some possible kinds of evidence and formulate my problems with each of these possibilities. Anyone who feels inclined is welcome to join the building of the list at any point in time and add or delete depending on the arguments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;X says: Yoga practice of self attainment without the help of external deity worship so common in those days of Patanjali as today was restricted to very few as it required proper initiation from the guru and renunciation of normal humdrum lifestyle of a common man. I say man because fewer women go for that kind of ascetic lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What has self-attainment to do with worshipping the deity (whether internal or external) in the Asian (or Indian) traditions? Except for what has been talked about the Bhakti tradition (especially by the European intellectuals, and picked up later on by the Indians), &amp;lsquo;self-attainment&amp;rsquo; stands radically divorced from any notion of deity &amp;ndash; as far as one can tell. The path of yoga (to stick to what this word refers to in the popular western consciousness) is different from that of meditation or bhakti, in the sense that the former focuses on control (as against &amp;rsquo;letting go&amp;rsquo; in the Buddhist traditions for instance). Renunciation, contrasting it to the &amp;rsquo;normal humdrum lifestyle&amp;rsquo;, is a pre-requisite primarily because this &amp;lsquo;attainment&amp;rsquo; (of &amp;lsquo;self&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;knowledge&amp;rsquo;, Mukti, or whatever) is predicated upon a meta-reflection (and a deep understanding) of the &amp;lsquo;humdrum&amp;rsquo; life. Such a reflection is cognitively impossible when you are involved (entangled would perhpas be a better word here) precisely in the very dynamic on which you have to reflect.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While reading Shabnum Tejani&amp;rsquo;s *Indian Secularism: A Social and Intellectual History (*2008), I ran into the same weird point that Neera Chandhoke also tried to make at the RRI platform debate on secularism. This is a combination of the old claim that &amp;lsquo;secularism&amp;rsquo; has acquired a different meaning in India and a general theoretical point: &amp;lsquo;secularism does not have any essence or universal meaning, but gets different meanings dependent on the historical and cultural contexts in which it has developed&amp;rsquo;. There are different variations on this formulation, but the general point is one that is becoming increasingly popular (especially among historians), because of the influence of Talal Asad and other postmodernators. Hence, I wanted to try and address the point by taking the example of Tejani&amp;rsquo;s work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;X says: &amp;ldquo;Wendy Doniger translates all the Sanskrit words into English and thereby ends up distorting their meaning. Dharma becomes religion, Varna becomes color, and apparently she ends up even translating the names of some tribes into English.&amp;rdquo; Assuming that this is the case (assumption is on my part because I have neither read her translation nor do I intend reading it), what is the problem? Out of the conversation, the following considerations came to the fore: (a) if she had retained some of these Sanskrit words, the Indian scholars could have made more sense of the translation; (b) Dharma and religion are not co-extensive in meaning, any more than Varna is with color; (c) consequently, there is a great distortion in translation. Underlying this discussion was a (fragmentarily explicit) view about translation that if we do not find &amp;lsquo;accurate&amp;rsquo; translations of words form one language into another, we should retain the original words, assign them the status of `technical&amp;rsquo; terms, and not translate them any further.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

However, unless one gives a technical meaning to &amp;lsquo;category&amp;rsquo; (which one can), these usages do not violate the primary distinction between a word from some natural language and its meaning.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Consider a classificatory scheme, say, cubes. Here, &amp;lsquo;cube&amp;rsquo; is a word, it has some meaning, and we classify (let us say) some objects together. That is, we say that some objects can be categorized as cubes. However, by saying this we do not mean that some objects (say some coloured, and some wooden objects) are instances of the English word &amp;lsquo;cube&amp;rsquo;. (Assume that we are teaching English to someone who does not know that language. When we classify some objects and teach him the word, we are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; teaching him how the word is written, what the constituent alphabets of that word are but its meaning. Now he understands the meaning of the word &amp;lsquo;cube&amp;rsquo;.) What we mean is that each of these objects is an instance of the category &amp;lsquo;cube&amp;rsquo; (i.e. the meaning of the word &amp;lsquo;cube&amp;rsquo;). Even here, we do not mean that the meaning of the word &amp;lsquo;cube&amp;rsquo;= some physical object. (That is, we do not suggest that &amp;lsquo;meaning&amp;rsquo; looks like a physical object. The physical object is not an embodiment of the meaning of a word.) What we mean is that the meaning of the word &amp;lsquo;cube&amp;rsquo; allows us to bring descriptions of some other objects together.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Fuss about Indic categories(concepts) I</title>
      <link>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/fuss-about-indic-categoriesconcepts/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/fuss-about-indic-categoriesconcepts/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Let me give the gist of the consensus and overlook philosophical nuances about categories.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Consider the following sentences: &amp;lsquo;It is raining&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;het regent&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;Es Regnet&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;Baarish aa raha hai&amp;rsquo;. All these sentences have the same meaning, namely that it is raining. Or it could also be said that they all express the same &amp;ldquo;proposition&amp;rdquo;. So, &amp;ldquo;meaning&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;proposition&amp;rdquo; are used as quasi-synonyms; and sentences from natural languages have meaning or express propositions. Another synonym to &amp;ldquo;meaning&amp;rdquo; would be the &amp;ldquo;sense&amp;rdquo; of a sentence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Which facts are relevant? Hipkapi and Hinduism</title>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many facts are interconnected within a culture. (The same applies to Nature too.) Some hypothesis or another notices some of these facts as facts, and it is able to provide an explanation (using the term &amp;rsquo;explanation&amp;rsquo; rather loosely) for them. This explanation helps us understand the phenomenon (means merely the appearance) in question because the theory or hypothesis under discussion is able to show what that interconnection between the sets of facts is. (That is, it tells us of the pattern that unifies these facts into a whole of some sort.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Is Bible an explanatorily intelligle account of Cosmos and of itself?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When a religion claims that it is the word of God and that the word is unconditionally true; and that, further, the word is about the Cosmos: everything that was, is and shall be. So, when I say that religion is such an entity, namely, it claims that it is the word of God and that it claims to be unconditionally true and that it is about the Cosmos, I am accepting the self description of religion. (However, the hypothesis that religion is an explanatorily intelligible (EI) account formulates it without committing itself to any ontological claims. That is, it takes no stances about what specific religions say or do not say about the existence of entities. The hypothesis does not show how, and in what sense, the Bible, say, is an EI account. It merely says that The Bible has such a status to believers. If you reread the relevant paragraphs of &amp;lsquo;The Heathen in his blindness: Asia, the West and the dynamic of religion&amp;rsquo; where I first formulate the hypothesis, you will notice that I formulate it conditionally: &amp;ldquo;If such a being exists, if such an account is forthcoming &amp;hellip; etc then we have an EI account.&amp;rdquo;) If we do not accept the self-description of religion, The Bible becomes a mere book and we cannot study it at all to say anything about Christianity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why the question about the origin of religion is ill-formulated?</title>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Are there accounts about the origin of religion? Yes, there are at least two kinds. One kind tries to localise the origin of religion in human beings and the other in God.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1.1. If religion is what it also says about itself, namely, it is the word of God, what are we trying to answer when we try to answer the issue of the origin of religion? Are we trying to give a scientific answer to the question, why God gave religion to humanity or are we trying to answer the question why humankind believes in the existence of God? If the former, then this question has been answered differently by different religions, i.e., this is the theology of these different religions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/do-practices-need-a-rational-justification/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If we understand the word &amp;rsquo;tradition&amp;rsquo; to mean &amp;lsquo;a set of practices&amp;rsquo;, then the question is this: why continue a set of practices? When someone &amp;lsquo;justifies&amp;rsquo; (I will soon explain why I use scare quotes for this) this by referring to the existence of a set of practices, what exactly is the person doing?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One way of looking at it is to say that the person &amp;lsquo;justifies&amp;rsquo; his actions and understand justification to mean providing a logically derived conclusion from a set of premises. The validity of the reasoning would constitute the justification in this context. Quite obviously, because we are speaking of logical justification, we are inclined to formulate the premises, test the derivation and look at the truth value of the conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Secularized Christian belief: worldview is a cultural universal</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/secularized-christian-belief-worldview-is-a-cultural-universal/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lets become clear about the nature of my claims about worldviews.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The word carries multiple meanings. It has partly to do with the multiple meanings of the component words: world&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;view&amp;rsquo;. In daily language-use, &amp;lsquo;world&amp;rsquo; is used to pick out (a) a spatial and temporal slice of the cosmos (b) and/or the entire Cosmos itself. The first, the slices, are many: from the &amp;lsquo;social world&amp;rsquo; to the &amp;rsquo;emotional world&amp;rsquo;; from earth (&amp;lsquo;our world&amp;rsquo;) to parts of the same (&amp;lsquo;our part of the world&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;in different parts of the world&amp;rsquo;) and so on. The same consideration applies to &amp;lsquo;view&amp;rsquo;: it could refer to perspectives (&amp;lsquo;my view of the issue&amp;rsquo;) and to the totality (&amp;lsquo;we now have a clear view of the situation&amp;rsquo;).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As though this is not enough, the word &amp;lsquo;world view&amp;rsquo; also carries additional multiple meanings: it picks out a totality of beliefs that some individual has; it refers at times exclusively to false beliefs (the Marxist use of the notion of ideology); it is either necessary or strictly superfluous (depending on how one interprets the scope of &amp;lsquo;ideology&amp;rsquo;); it picks out the common denominator among a group of people and the latter itself can refer to a nation, a class, a culture, the species, etc.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/secularization-and-world-views/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;To begin with the question raised in `The Heathen in his blindness: Asia, the West and the dynamic of religion&amp;rsquo;: Do all cultures, peoples, and individuals need a world view to navigate themselves in the world? The answer is in the negative because religion is not a cultural universal and the only examples we have of world views are religions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Are the atheists, free thinkers, and people ignorant of religious doctrines of Christianity (in the West) also religious? This question has a positive answer because of the process of secularization of religion. In this sense, keeping in mind that the process of secularization is how a religion attempts to transcend its constraints, the atheists etc. in the west do have a Christian world view. This means the following: they accept the doctrines of a de-Christianized Christianity and, for these to be continually transmitted and make sense to those who accept them, this religion requires to be present in the background (and is subject to secularization movement). That is to say, we can identify elements of a Christian world view in the west, and we can do that only because that religion is present in the culture. We need to keep in mind that these beliefs are part of a world view only because such a world view is present in that culture.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Is enlightenment learnable?</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/is-enlightenment-learnable/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Is enlightenment learnable? (In a less loaded formulation: Can all people be happy?) My answer is an unequivocal &amp;lsquo;yes&amp;rsquo;. Before we go further, we need to be clear what exactly this sentence says: enlightenment is not, say, the result of some genes (that explains why we get molars and not tusks, for instance), nor is it a law of nature (that explains why, say, water boils when heated and does not become gold instead) and so on. While individual psychology (and the combination of the chromosomes in each individual) does have a certain role to play in our lives, they cannot explain why I learnt something (say, English) at all. At best, if we are able to develop our understanding to the extent that we can explain such questions, they could explain why I learnt English slowly or mastered in two weeks&amp;rsquo; time. To understand why I learnt English, you have to look elsewhere: at my biography and not into the structure of my genes. However, that I could learn a natural language at all might be explained by evolutionary biology one day. But its explanation, in such a case, will encompass all human beings. It is in this sense that I say that Enlightenment is learnable or that all human beings can be happy. (This is something that out traditions have always taught and I think they are right.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You do not want to call our natural sciences as &amp;lsquo;knowledge&amp;rsquo;. I do not even mind that. (For instance, you might want to define &amp;lsquo;knowledge&amp;rsquo; as &amp;rsquo;true and justified belief&amp;rsquo;. You might show me that our theories in natural sciences are only believed to be true and are not proved to be true. Therefore, you might want to say that our natural sciences are not &amp;lsquo;knowledge&amp;rsquo; according to your definition. Fair enough.) Since you want to conduct a discussion about knowledge and if our sciences are not examples of knowledge, I need to know whether there are other examples of knowledge. If such an entity exists, our discussions make sense. If we have no examples of knowledge at all, according to some or another definition of the word, how could we discuss about that? I mean to say, if not even the logics we use in out argument is an example of knowledge, how could we ever have any discussion about the scope, range, etc. of knowledge? We cannot. In other words, if we want to have discussions about knowledge, we need to have examples of knowledge and need to use these examples in our discussions about their nature. So, you have to tell me: (a) whether we have examples of knowledge; (b) what they are; (c) how we should use them in our discussions; (d) show that their use does not pervert our discussions about knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Consider the following possibility: let us assume that in some of my writings, I reach the same conclusion as some or another ideologue from Hindutva. (Of course, neither Steve Farmer nor Michael Witzel shows that this is the case. But that is not the issue.) In other words, let us assume that, with respect to some or another issue, I arrive at the same conclusion as people from the Hinudtva movement do. The question is: what does that indicate, or prove or is an evidence for? After all, Witzel, Farmer and others reach the same conclusion as the Hindutva people do, when you ask them about the sum of two integers (say adding two to itself); or (assuming the presence of relevant knowledge in both) about the chemical composition of water and any number of such allied stuff. They would also (probably) agree with respect to current geography, Capitals of different nations, and so on and so forth. Why is this agreement between them and the Hindutva not suspect? Why does some or another alleged agreement that I could have with the Hindutva make me a Hindutva man?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You ask whether or not it was &amp;lsquo;factual&amp;rsquo; that a &amp;lsquo;paraiah&amp;rsquo; was not allowed on the same street as a Nair or a Brahmin. The evidence we have says that a Paraiah was not allowed to be on the same street as a Nair, but it is not clear whether it also applies to the presence of a Brahmin. First, here is some of the evidence.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Portuguese traveler Duarte Barbosa was among the first to talk about it in &amp;lsquo;The Book&amp;rsquo;. Though written in 1518, it became known to the European world through the Italian translation in the book of travels edited by Gian Baptista Ramusio. In the English translation, we hear who the Nairs are: &amp;ldquo;None may become a Nayre, save only he who is of Nayre lineage. They are very free from stain in their nobility. They will not touch anyone of low caste&amp;rdquo; . You need to keep in mind that Barbosa does not speak of &amp;rsquo;low caste&amp;rsquo;, as an earlier footnote by the English editor and translator, Dames, indicates: &amp;ldquo;The word used in the text in vilam (villão in modern spelling) corresponding to the English villain in its ancient sense&amp;rdquo; . In other words, Barbosa appears to have seen a distinction in lineage or a distinction between the Nobility and the Rural folk when he saw the Nairs and the &amp;rsquo;low caste&amp;rsquo; people.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>‘Facts’ are facts of a theory</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/facts-are-facts-of-a-theory/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Until the sixties of the previous century, there was some kind of consensus about the nature of scientific enterprise. One strand within it had to do with the nature of facts. One thought that scientists collected facts (data) and formulated hypothesis (or theories) to explain them. This distinction between theory and facts was seen as an absolute distinction: facts (or data) existed in Nature (or culture) and theories explained them. However, today, the consensus tells us that this is not the case. (This distinction has been scrutinized from many different points of view since the fifties: in terms of language, in terms of the history of the sciences, in terms of scientific revolutions, in terms of philosophy of sciences&amp;hellip;) Today, one accepts that facts are not some theory-neutral entities existing in either Nature or culture and that the distinction between them is a relative distinction. All our facts are theory-dependent; in some contexts we treat some of the claims of a background theory as facts. In another context, the same facts are discussed as theoretical claims.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For instance, in some contexts, one takes the Hindus worshipping Ganesha as a fact. (This fact, for instance, functions as evidence that Ganesha is a god and/or that Hinduism is a religion and so on.) In another context, the same fact becomes an issue of theoretical controversy: are the Hindus worshipping Ganesha or not? (I challenge that nature of this fact and suggest that some kind of theology describes our actions in these terms.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;One has faith in God and, therefore, trusts that His message is also The Truth. That is to say, one should not predicate the attitude of having `faith in&amp;rsquo; to the EI account directly. There is a very important additional reason for being clear about our terminologies.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Consider the distinction between having no idea that the Cosmos is an EI entity and having an account that makes the Cosmos into such an entity. This distinction marks the difference between the heathen and the believer. In religious terminology, the difference can also be expressed as that which exists between the &amp;ldquo;converted&amp;rdquo; and the &amp;ldquo;non-converted&amp;rdquo;. This is one meaning of the word &amp;ldquo;conversion&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;X says that Christological dilemma is some kind of theological logic and suggests that ordinary Christians are not affected by this artificial problematic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are two issues here worth looking at separately.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Is the problematic artificial? Well, it depends. I am not claiming that every Christian (past, present and future) is &lt;em&gt;aware&lt;/em&gt; of this problematic, of course. This is a general formulation that attempts to capture the variety in Christianity as answers to some specific problem. It has the same status as some or another scientific law. Even though what we have in this Cosmos, say, are &lt;em&gt;concrete, moving objects of specific size, volume, density and so on&lt;/em&gt;, we have laws that describe such specific movements as instances of a &lt;em&gt;general&lt;/em&gt; law. In exactly the same way, I (partially) describe the varieties within Christianity as various answers to the Christological dilemma. Does that make my description artificial? Well, this is an issue about &lt;em&gt;your own&lt;/em&gt; metaphysics: what &amp;rsquo;natural&amp;rsquo; is, what &amp;lsquo;social&amp;rsquo; is, what &amp;lsquo;cultural&amp;rsquo; is and what &amp;lsquo;artificial&amp;rsquo; is. All I can say is that my description does partially capture the &lt;em&gt;variety&lt;/em&gt; within Christianity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What does it matter where they came from and how? Newton did not travel through the Cosmos and visit planets in order to formulate his theories of planetary motion. That guy did not even visit India to find out whether the &lt;em&gt;naked fakirs&lt;/em&gt; levitate or not. With the proverbial falling of the apple on his head (this story is too beautiful to let go!), Sir Isaac made claims about gravitation and flatly claimed (as an implication) that the equally proverbial &lt;em&gt;fakir&lt;/em&gt; could not levitate! Einstein was sitting in a tram, watching a car go by and feeling quite frustrated, when he came up with the theory of special relativity. Surely, while such anecdotes are quite interesting in their own right, we do not claim that the theories of Newton and Einstein are not worthy of consideration &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; of how they came into existence. The theory of double helix occurred literally in a dream; would we therefore dismiss it by saying that Watson dreamt the whole thing and that it was his personal nightmare?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Social issues, inherently, are neither paradoxical any more than they are contradictory. It is the &lt;em&gt;formulation&lt;/em&gt; of these issues that gives birth to paradoxes, contradictions and such like. (For the simple reason that &amp;lsquo;paradox&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;contradiction&amp;rsquo;, etc. are properties of statements, not of objects and events.) If there is a &amp;lsquo;paradox&amp;rsquo; of freedom, then it lies not in the situation where one tradition (or even a set of traditions) meets another: that is to say, it is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the situation of Indian traditions meeting religions like Christianity and Islam that gives birth to the &amp;lsquo;paradox&amp;rsquo;. Rather, it is by describing this meeting of the Indian traditions with religions like Christianity and Islam &lt;em&gt;as an issue involving freedom&lt;/em&gt; (i.e. conceptualizing this meeting in terms of freedom) that one generates the paradox. There exist &lt;em&gt;other descriptions&lt;/em&gt; that &lt;em&gt;do not&lt;/em&gt; give birth to this &amp;lsquo;paradox of freedom&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Each time I tell someone, whether in a one-to-one discussion or in a conference, &amp;ldquo;there is no religion in India&amp;rdquo;, I get the following answer: &amp;ldquo;Of course, that depends on how you define &amp;lsquo;religion&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;. I answer as follows: &amp;ldquo;In that case, here is my definition: &amp;lsquo;Religion=what does not exist in India&amp;rsquo;. Will that do? If it is really a question of the definition of a word, why does one need to write such a big book?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Explanations that trivialize experiences</title>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In many cultures, especially in the Indian case, it is important to understand that stories are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; explanations. They are neither true nor false because they do not describe &amp;lsquo;factual&amp;rsquo; events; they do not claim that they do either. Unlike the Bible, the Puranas do not have to be true or known to be true for them to play the role they do in the Indian culture. The Indian myths neither allegorize virtues nor are they &amp;lsquo;disguised&amp;rsquo; histories. In other words, the presuppositions of your question (common ones in the western scholarship since the Enlightenment) are &lt;em&gt;false&lt;/em&gt; and based on ignorance about the genre of the myth and the roles they play. (I can only assert these claims having argued them &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/comparative-anthropology-and-action-sciences-an-essay-on-knowing-to-act-and-acting-to-know-s-n-balagangadhara/&#34;&gt;elsewhere.&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Could religion be a neural disorder?</title>
      <link>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/could-religion-be-a-neural-disorder/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Religion lays claim to truth, both about itself and the Cosmos. It is true the way no other account (that we know of) is. However, religion also generates (or brings into being) a configuration of learning. That is, it enables a coordination of different learning processes into a configuration. A culture is such a configuration of learning.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Could religion be a neural disorder? I do not see how we could say any such thing unless we already presuppose (at a minimum) what we have to prove, viz., religion is untrue. One of the difficulties involved in disproving the truth of religion has to do with the fact that religion is true in a way none of the human cognitive products are. (Remember that its truth is founded on nothing else except itself.) Of course, we are free to say that all believers have some kind of pathology. (Many accounts of religion have tended to say this as well.) But this is an assumption that will not allow us to understand religion: we will see it either as a human product or as some kind of virus that affects human brain. In both cases, it is an assumption that begs the question.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Comparative anthropology, as a discipline, studies and contrasts, where such contrasts are possible, the different ways in which human beings organize their lives, think about and experience both themselves and world around them. A culture is a form of life and, as such, it is a way of going about the world. One would therefore expect to find a deep and intimate relation between action sciences on the one hand, and studies of culture on the other. A perusal of literature, however, shows the fact of the matter to be different.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Though the book was published nearly two decades ago, Said&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Orientalism&lt;/em&gt; continues to be topical. Many have rejected the message of this work; others have attempted to develop its arguments yet further. This article will not be one more interpretation of Said&amp;rsquo;s book; after all, there are many such interpretations, including Said&amp;rsquo;s own. Instead, it probes the phenomenon of &amp;lsquo;post-Orientalism&amp;rsquo;. Even here, the intention is not to map its contours either historically or conceptually. Rather, the focus is on raising the question: what next after &lt;em&gt;Orientalism&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it is best that we begin on a personal note. Neither of the two authors of this article is a &amp;lsquo;specialist&amp;rsquo; in the domain of argumentation theory. Even though we have picked up smatterings of logic, we are not professionals working on either informal or formal logic. One of us is a practicing anthropologist, while the other is oriented towards comparative anthropology. And yet, we are invited to speak to an audience comprising of people specializing in dialogue logics, argumentation theory, psychology and such like. If the invitation to present a paper is not mistake or an oversight on the part of the organizers of this colloquium, then it could only mean that there is an expectation regarding our contributions: anthropologists have something to say about rhetorics, argumentations and their norms, which is of relevance to specialists like you.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Rituals and their meaninglessness—S.N.Balagangadhara</title>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Consider, say, a ritual like sandhyaavandanam. Here are two extremes, when it comes to saying what it is: (a) one goes very deeply into what Mudras mean, which of the mudras occur in this daily ritual; analyses the praanayaama as it is taught; goes into what the Gaayathri mantra really means; and so on. (b) The other extreme is an ordinary Brahmin who performs all the prescribed actions without knowing what any of them mean.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1.1. When asked, they both give their answers: the one tells us of the results of his research and the other simply says: &amp;ldquo;I do not know what any of these mean. I perform them because I have been taught that way.&amp;rdquo; Question: which one of these claims is &lt;em&gt;TRUE&lt;/em&gt;? Further, unless you make a &lt;em&gt;meta-assumption&lt;/em&gt; about the whether or not rituals &lt;em&gt;ought to have&lt;/em&gt; a meaning, you cannot even privilege one story above the other.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Colonial Consciousness as a process and as an event</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/colonial-consciousness-as-a-process-and-as-an-event/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is an event because the colonial consciousness that I am talking about comprises of multiplicity of actions executed by indefinitely many Indians over a long period. It is a process because colonial consciousness reproduces itself, colonial consciousness is transmitted from generation to generation and it is learnt. Consequently, we need to understand the mechanisms of this process and the structure of that event.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At the minimum, this process has to be cognitive in nature. It must be cognitive because a cognitive framework (and theories within that framework) denies access to our experience and makes us reproduce some sets of descriptions as though they are descriptions of our experience. It has to be cognitive at the minimum because in reproducing some sets of descriptions and in embellishing them with details, we act as though we understand such descriptions. In other words, the growth and spread of colonial consciousness requires some kind of a cognitive explanation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Speaking of &amp;rsquo;the greatest mystery of our humanness&amp;rsquo;, Sinari raises the following questions: &amp;ldquo;Why are we present in the world rather than not being there at all? Why are we present to ourselves as world-experiencers and world-explorers rather than being simply there as perhaps animals are&amp;rdquo; (p.1) In brief reply to his provocative paper, I would like to reflect on the nature of these queries and with the issue: what would count as an answer to these questions&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When we speak about ignorance, we can do so in two ways. One is by talking about &amp;lsquo;how the world is&amp;rsquo;; the other is by talking about &amp;lsquo;how we think the world is&amp;rsquo;. Even though we could use both ways to characterize &amp;lsquo;ignorance&amp;rsquo;, they are not coextensive (or synonyms) because (a) they are about different things – in the first case it is about the world; in the second case it is about what we take to exist in the world – and, therefore, (b) they have different consequences.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this post, I want to reflect on what it means &lt;em&gt;to access and think&lt;/em&gt; about experience. Perhaps, not so much on what these words mean but what is entailed by (or what happens when we indulge in) this kind of activity. I think the best way to begin this analysis is by asking the following two questions about an activity familiar to most of us: what do we do when we think about ourselves? Do we do it the &amp;lsquo;right&amp;rsquo; way? Let me begin with the first question and postpone looking at the second for a later stage, including how we should understand it. Because most of us know how we think about ourselves most of the times, I will take a trivial example and skip over certain explanations and analyses. The holes in my reasoning can either be filled by our memories or by discussing them at a later stage.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Cultural difference: temporality</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/cultural-difference-temporality/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Experiences are structured differently in different cultures. We believe that it is possible to give a &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt; description of this difference, at some level or the other, &lt;em&gt;as&lt;/em&gt;a difference regarding the &lt;em&gt;experience of time&lt;/em&gt; itself. Consider the traditions of Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. One of the central notions in these traditions is that of &lt;em&gt;temporality&lt;/em&gt;. That is, they believe that all events, processes, and objects are transient, irreversible, and fleeting. From this &lt;em&gt;experience&lt;/em&gt; of transience and very few assumptions about human psychology, these traditions have quasi-derived some of the most fascinating doctrines that we know of. It is worthwhile to contrast these with Judeo-Christian traditions, where this kind of temporality plays no role. It is possible to explain the &lt;em&gt;actions&lt;/em&gt; of people in these cultures, at some level of adequacy, by appealing to their conceptions and/or experiences of time. One can research on the question &amp;ldquo;does not &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt;experience of transience play a causal role in the actions they perform?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;During the last decade or so, a new restlessness has begun to disturb the calm facade of the social scientific academia. As yet, it has no name. Better said, it has many names: from &amp;lsquo;reflexive&amp;rsquo; to the &amp;lsquo;post-modern&amp;rsquo;. The ferment is not widespread, but the voices of discontent are coherent and articulate. The critical voices indicate the many kinds of dissatisfaction they have with the status and nature of social sciences. Even though most dissenters cannot be grouped as representatives of any one tradition, many of their writings stand out above the rest. Two such authors are Wilhelm Halbfass and Ronald Inden; each has written a book that is worthy of attention and respect.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

New York and Bern: Peter Lang, 1989 xxii+490.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In order to set the tone of this review article, let me begin straightway with a confession: I have been a closet admirer of Frits Staal ever since I discovered his writings in 1987. The reasons that undergird my attitude are several: firstly, most of his writings are about a culture I am familiar with, namely, India; secondly, absent from them is the dewy-eyed romanticism that is pernicious to any serious study of cultures and people; thirdly, present in them are insights that are immensely important and extremely exciting; fourthly, the theses argued for are the results of absolutely pioneering research which fly in the face of deeply entrenched commonsense wisdom; and so on… He is my fellow-traveler on more tracks than one, and my own thinking on several subjects over the last few years carry the deep imprint of Staal&amp;rsquo;s rigorous thinking and painstaking enquiries.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, there are multiple images of India current in the West. There is the mystic India, an image that the German Romantics created and the &amp;lsquo;flower children&amp;rsquo; of the sixties made popular. There is the third world India with enormous poverty and suffering, which the developmental workers have projected. There is also the India, the centre of IT outsourcing, which the developments in the last decade have brought into existence, and so on. Amartya Sen, the Indian noble prize-winner in Economics, has written a book on &amp;ldquo;The Argumentative Indian&amp;rdquo; which speaks of an India that he wants us to consider. This India is an India with a history of toleration and pluralism, an India that has brought forth its own version of &amp;lsquo;secularism&amp;rsquo;, and an India that is every bit rational, discursive and analytical as the western culture itself.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My book is not about India but about the western culture. It is a study of the western culture using one thread, namely, religion. To the extent I talk about India, I do so using some of the &amp;lsquo;facts&amp;rsquo; that Indologists (and others) have so far used. My use of their facts (to show the opposite of what they believe they have shown) illustrates the consensus in the philosophies of sciences (of the last hundred years or more) that &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/facts-are-facts-of-a-theory/&#34;&gt;&amp;lsquo;facts&amp;rsquo; are mostly facts of a theory.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Commonalities and Similarities—S.N.Balagangadhara</title>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Whether or not we observe &amp;lsquo;commonalities&amp;rsquo; has to do with the descriptive framework we use. Things might share common properties in one description; at the same time, share nothing common in another description. Both could be true descriptions of the same set of objects. &amp;lsquo;Perception of similarity&amp;rsquo; is (at the moment our knowledge is in) is extremely difficult to analyze and understand. On the one hand, our perceptual abilities (as they have evolved out of a successful adaptation to the world) must tell us what is present in the world. Otherwise, we could not have evolved. (We share this with other products of evolutionary development, i.e. with other species.) On the other hand, we cannot &lt;em&gt;say&lt;/em&gt; what that similarity is without using a descriptive frame work. (When the notion of &amp;lsquo;similarity&amp;rsquo; poses such problems, the problem of &amp;lsquo;commonality&amp;rsquo; is even more difficult to solve. This is a matter of &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; philosophical debate: do two objects share the &amp;lsquo;common property&amp;rsquo; of &amp;ldquo;being blue&amp;rdquo; or are they merely similar to each other?) Even though I have no solution to this problem, I fail to see the relevance of solving it for my enterprise.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;2.1. You say: &amp;ldquo;While our Western observers mistakenly saw religion in India…&amp;rdquo;. As a scientist, you should know that Nature cannot be cut at its joints because Nature does not have joints. It is our theory (or description) of the world that allows us to speak of (relatively) independent phenomena like gravitation, electrical forces, magnetism, nuclear attraction and such like. Again, it is our theories that try to unify these forces. That is to say, our theories first distinguished them, only to try and unify them at a later stage. The same applies to culture. The western observers did not &amp;lsquo;see&amp;rsquo; religion; their hypothesis about religion allowed them to construct a phenomenon (from a set of facts which their hypothesis singled out as relevant) &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; called Hinduism &lt;em&gt;as a religion&lt;/em&gt;. So, unless you are willing to argue that cultures comprise of distinct and discrete phenomena called &amp;lsquo;religion&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;politics&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;secular&amp;rsquo; and such like, you cannot claim that the western observers saw &amp;lsquo;something&amp;rsquo; that is discrete and that they mistakenly described it as a religion.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is partly a term of the art (in the philosophy of sciences) and partly retains the commonsense usage. When one compares theories (in order to choose the best one among the rivals), one compares them with respect to the important properties that theories should have. What these properties are depends upon the philosophy of science one subscribes to. For instance, one might think that a theory should explain phenomena. If this demand is put, then one chooses a theory that does a better job at explaining the phenomenon. One might add additional conditions to this demand in order to clarify what it means to explain &amp;lsquo;better&amp;rsquo;. For instance, one might want to say that some theory X explains a phenomenon better than theory Y if X can explain some additional things as well, or explains things that theory Y cannot explain. One might further add that the theory X should be falsifiable or that it has more facts in its favor. Or, again, one could suggest that the theory X is better than Y because X solves more problems than Y. Or again, that X is more useful in prediction than Y. And so on. In other words, what constitutes &amp;lsquo;better&amp;rsquo; (in the claim that theory X is better than theory Y) depends very much on the kind of philosophy of science that one accepts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;All works of Balagangadhara make use of &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use%E2%80%93mention_distinction&#34;&gt;use-mention distinction&lt;/a&gt;. Please get familiarized with this distinction.&#xA;In logic the words &amp;lsquo;use&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;mention&amp;rsquo; are sometimes used in a technical sense to mark an important distinction, which is explaind by example:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;lsquo;London&amp;rsquo; is a word six letters long.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;London is a city.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In 1 the word &amp;lsquo;London&amp;rsquo; is said to be mentioned; in 2 the word &amp;lsquo;London&amp;rsquo; is said to be &lt;em&gt;used&lt;/em&gt; (and not mentioned).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What did the theory of gravitation do? Apart from describing the fall of bodies on earth, it also tied the motion of planets and the ebb and tide in the sea to each other. This theory allowed us to predict the motion of the planets and helped us discover a new planet in the solar system. In other words, it provided a theory that unified phenomena. Until that stage, we did not know that these three phenomena were linked together, and we had independent explanations for each of them. This is one of the things that a theory does: it identifies the phenomena that belong together.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The English word &amp;lsquo;Hinduism&amp;rsquo; not only carries multiple meanings it also appears to refer to many different things. If the context of the discussion were to help us disambiguate the reference of this word, it might not pose many problems for a serious discussion. Unfortunately, the context itself gets muddled. Each understands the question &amp;lsquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/does-hinduism-exist/&#34;&gt;Does Hinduism Exist?&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo; in a different fashion. As though this is not enough, this confusion enters into other areas as well: witness the challenge for people to prove that Sikhism does not exist. The prima facie evidence seems to be the following: the word &amp;lsquo;Hinduism&amp;rsquo; seems to carry many different kinds of (ontological) commitments (i.e. when we use the word, we seem to make assumptions about the kind of entities that exist in the world), many different epistemological positions (i.e. how can either know or not know what that word refers to).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;To take German language, let us look at how Heidegger talks about &amp;lsquo;being&amp;rsquo;: there is the &amp;lsquo;big Being&amp;rsquo; (&amp;lsquo;Sein&amp;rsquo;) and there is the &amp;lsquo;small being&amp;rsquo; (&amp;lsquo;Dasein&amp;rsquo; meaning &amp;rsquo;there-being&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;so-being&amp;rsquo;). And then there is &amp;lsquo;Sein&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;Seindes&amp;rsquo;. All these are translated by the word &amp;lsquo;being&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To jump back a couple of hundred years, and pick up another philosopher with the same alphabet and the same language, we have G.W.F. Hegel. His &amp;lsquo;Sein&amp;rsquo; of course has nothing to do with the &amp;lsquo;Sein&amp;rsquo; of Heidegger, even though both are translated as &amp;lsquo;Being&amp;rsquo; with a big B. So, even in one language, there are problems with respect to translating words into another language.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Atheism: a secularized theism—Jakob de Roover</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;1: Atheism is a phenomenon that came into being in the western culture at around the time of the so-called Enlightenment. The West claims that it liberated itself from the dogmas of the Christian religion in this Enlightenment, and those who call themselves atheists mean by this that they belong to the enlightened people who &amp;ldquo;have escaped from the dogmatic illusions of religion.&amp;rdquo; Now, as it has always done, Christian Europe simply identified its own history with human history in general, and it claimed that all cultures had so far been under the ignorant spell of religion, but that they could now be liberated by the Enlightened West. This claim needs two separate premises: (a) That all cultures have religion (b) That atheism was a new and rational system of beliefs that could liberate people from all cultures from this illusion of religion.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The logical steps that &lt;em&gt;inevitably&lt;/em&gt; make the claim that God revealed His Will in Jesus Christ into an unconditional and exclusive truth claim are fairly simple:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(a) Christianity says that the universe was created by God, and that this universe is the perfect embodiment of His will or plan;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(b) Furthermore, it claims that this God has revealed His Will to humankind, and that this revelation is the Christian doctrine as it is &amp;rsquo;embodied&amp;rsquo; in Jesus Christ;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The ascription of professional competence to oneself when one does not have that. Each is in a position to say what &amp;rsquo;the Caste System&amp;rsquo; is, what &amp;rsquo;ethics&amp;rsquo; is, what &amp;lsquo;corruption&amp;rsquo; is, what &amp;lsquo;religion&amp;rsquo; is, what &amp;lsquo;Hinduism&amp;rsquo; is… Why does one need to build new social science, when &amp;rsquo;every Hindu specimen&amp;rsquo; is an authority on these subjects? I suppose one can also be a physicist, biologist and chemist on these grounds as well: after all, is one not subject to gravitational forces, chemical reactions in the body, and suffers pain as well?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is in the nature of a rhetorical text that the author uses linguistic &amp;rsquo;tropes&amp;rsquo; (metaphors, similes, analogies, imagery, etc) to persuade a reader about the reasonableness of a specific standpoint. It does not build arguments that systematically lead to a stand point but instead tries to convince the readers (or listeners) by using the abilities built into natural languages. Such texts do not easily lend themselves to a discussion regarding the steps taken in developing a stand point, unlike, say, a mathematical proof or a philosophical argument. Of course, I do not find such texts &amp;lsquo;irrational&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I am glad too that you put across some thoughtful considerations without being polemical, and that can only help generate a stimulating discussion among all the concerned parties. However, the way you frame your points make the task an exercise in walking on a tight rope.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The first striking thing is their &lt;em&gt;presumption of knowledge&lt;/em&gt; at several levels. Yet, they display abysmal ignorance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(a) Christianity has not just had a two thousand years&amp;rsquo; history. It has also had two thousand years of doctrinal development. In the latter, every notion that has been employed here has been &lt;em&gt;continuously&lt;/em&gt; discussed, refined, contested and so on. Their meanings, as they apply to Christianity&amp;rsquo;s self-description, has seeped into and determined what they mean in the English language. Not only words like &amp;lsquo;Christ&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;Church&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;Worship&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;idol&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;God&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;revelation&amp;rsquo; and so on but also issues like &amp;lsquo;Who is a Christian&amp;rsquo;? (&lt;em&gt;Quid sit Christianum esse?&lt;/em&gt;) The discussions hardly exhibit any knowledge of either the richness or complexity of these matters; yet, they express the firm conviction that what is there to be known is also known. In matters of knowledge, this combination is deadly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Imagine that I were to say the following: Christ and &lt;em&gt;Ganesha&lt;/em&gt; are manifestations of the same divinity; Christ came about 2000 years ago in the Middle East, whereas &lt;em&gt;Ganesha&lt;/em&gt; is how he has appeared in India some 4000 years ago. Now no one can forbid me from saying this and &lt;em&gt;calling myself a Christian&lt;/em&gt;. Question: what should a theory about Christianity do? Show &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; anyone who decides to call himself a &amp;lsquo;Christian&amp;rsquo; is, in fact, also a Christian? In that case, all such a &amp;rsquo;theory&amp;rsquo; can do is say something like the following: anyone who calls himself some name (&amp;lsquo;Christian&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;Democrat&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;Marxist&amp;rsquo;, etc) is also whatever he calls himself. Such an attitude simply ends up making any knowledge of society and human beings impossible.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

In fact, I have not even discussed any specific theological doctrine of any kind of Christianity, except to speak of the Christological dilemma. This dilemma is discussed by theologians, themselves Christians, in the field of Christology. And even here, I localise in it the dynamics of Christianity. The intolerance of Christianity, I say very explicitly, is its property by virtue of being a &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;religion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. That is to say, according to my research, all &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;religions are intolerant&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. You might want to disagree with it; you are welcome to put your arguments across that refute the result of my research. But how does this constitute spreading hate? I am puzzled.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Question: One thing that Balu says is that propping up legislations against tricky proselytizations reflects the weaknesses of Indian culture needs to be explained though. How is it a weakness? How is it not a strength?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In both the theory of rights and in discussions about liberty (or freedom), the following two ways of conceptualizing the issues have been present. One could see rights as an &amp;ldquo;ability or power or capacity&amp;rdquo; to do something (this is called &amp;ldquo;active rights&amp;rdquo;) or as a &amp;ldquo;duty someone else has towards the rights subject&amp;rdquo; (called the &amp;ldquo;passive rights&amp;rdquo;). Equally, liberty has been conceptualized &amp;lsquo;positively&amp;rsquo; (as one&amp;rsquo;s capacity) or &amp;rsquo;negatively&amp;rsquo; (what the other should not do to you). Any good introduction to the theory of rights or theory of liberty will provide you with the details you require as well as the limitations of these two conceptualizations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Meanings and Historical Context: the arguments from Indian scholars –S.N.Balagangadhara</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/meanings-and-historical-context-the-arguments-from-indian-scholars-s-n-balagangadhara/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt; Consider the thought that &amp;lsquo;meanings&amp;rsquo; (leave aside the distinction between words and sentences on the one hand and concepts and categories on the other) do not exist outside historical contexts. What exactly does this thought say? Begin with &amp;lsquo;historical context&amp;rsquo;. Either every situation that an individual human being finds himself is a &amp;lsquo;historical context&amp;rsquo; (because human beings are always &amp;lsquo;in a context&amp;rsquo; and these contexts always occur &amp;lsquo;in history&amp;rsquo;) or there is a difference between &amp;rsquo; a context&amp;rsquo; and a &amp;lsquo;historical context&amp;rsquo;.  She cannot possibly make the latter of the two claims because if the meaning of &amp;lsquo;secularism&amp;rsquo; changes only in &amp;lsquo;historical contexts&amp;rsquo; but not in &amp;lsquo;other kinds of contexts&amp;rsquo;, it follows that &amp;lsquo;secularism&amp;rsquo; has a stable meaning in other contexts than  &amp;lsquo;historical contexts&amp;rsquo;, which she would want to deny. So, for the sake of consistency, we have to assume that &amp;lsquo;context&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;historical context&amp;rsquo; are synonyms. Then, the thought is that meaning varies according to contexts. Consider the word &amp;lsquo;ice-cream&amp;rsquo;: the only way I can imagine that the meaning of this word varies according to individual contexts is the following: to one, it means a &amp;rsquo;life saver&amp;rsquo;; to the other &amp;lsquo;fattening&amp;rsquo; and to the third &amp;lsquo;sweet&amp;rsquo; and so on. (In fact, to one and the same individual &amp;lsquo;ice cream&amp;rsquo; could &amp;ldquo;mean different things&amp;rdquo; at different points in time: what ice-cream meant  when one was 3 years need indeed not be the same as what it means when one is 50 and suffers from Diabetes and obesity.) So far so good. But the problem is this: these different meanings of &amp;lsquo;ice-cream&amp;rsquo; presuppose that we are talking about the same thing. Only under this condition can we say that &amp;lsquo;ice-cream&amp;rsquo; means different things to different people (or to the same person at different times).  To talk about the same thing, ice-cream, we need a reference for that word and, in many cases (like secularism and communalism, for example) it is a &amp;rsquo;linguistic description&amp;rsquo; of that word (a &amp;lsquo;definition&amp;rsquo;, or its &amp;lsquo;meaning&amp;rsquo;) that provides us with reference. (In the case of ice-cream, one might use gestures to point out an ice-cream; you cannot do that for &amp;lsquo;secularism&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;communalism&amp;rsquo;.) In other words, the ONLY possible way for secularism to have multiple meanings in multiple historical contexts is by having a meaning that is INDEPENDENT of contexts. (Or having a meaning that is common across all POSSIBLE contexts.) In other words, when Neera or Shabnum or anyone else makes the claim that meanings do not transcend contexts either (a) they are making the trivial point that every word uttered by any human being always takes place in a context (which no one had ever denied) or (b) by saying that meaning is totally context bound they are contradicting themselves. Of course, to notice that one is inconsistent, one needs to think according to the rules of grammar and rules of logic.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Let me just focus on one important and one not-so-important claim from Will Sweetman&amp;rsquo;s article &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hinduism&amp;rdquo; and the history of &amp;ldquo;religion&amp;rdquo;: Protestant presuppositions in the critique of the concept of Hinduism.&lt;/em&gt; He suggests that I argue the following.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First premise: Christianity is prototypically what religion is.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Second premise: Hinduism does not share all (or perhaps any) of the relevant properties of Christianity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Hinduism is not a religion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The problem, here, turns around the notion of &amp;lsquo;prototypicality&amp;rsquo;. I explain at length (a) the source of the word; and (b) its meaning. For the role these clarifications play in Sweetman&amp;rsquo;s analysis, I might as well not have written those passages.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You say: Thus when one says that many Indian Christians are pluralistic &amp;hellip; it cannot be refuted simply by saying, well Christian doctrine fundamentally cannot be pluralistic &amp;ndash; because all doctrine ultimately always gets interpreted at the level of the individual.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While it is indeed true that, in the last analysis, everything happens at the level of the individual, it is wrong to say that, &lt;em&gt;therefore&lt;/em&gt;, claims about the Indian Christians cannot be refuted by referring to Christian theology.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Christians of all hue agree that the &lt;em&gt;figure of Christ&lt;/em&gt; is central to the religion that Christianity is. This figure is &amp;ldquo;the promised one&amp;rdquo;, the &amp;ldquo;messiah&amp;rdquo;, the &amp;ldquo;anointed one&amp;rdquo;, and so on. Kindly note that there is a difference between the Christ as a figure and &lt;em&gt;Jesus of Nazareth&lt;/em&gt;. The Jews also believe in the Christ figure, but they figure that he has not yet come, and they are awaiting his arrival. The Christians reckon that the Christ has come and that Jesus of Nazareth was the &amp;ldquo;prophesied one&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Secularized Christian theme: interests of a social institution/Christian Church</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;About the state, state action and the issue of public interest. There are multiple problems here, which I am only slowly beginning to recognize. I will share two such problems with you without, however, being able to concretely spell out the alternatives. (a) Consider the belief that the state &amp;lsquo;ought&amp;rsquo; to act in the public interest. This belief makes sense if we assume that it is possible to speak in terms of &amp;lsquo;public interest&amp;rsquo; in some non-trivial fashion. Both Kenneth Arrow and Amrtya Sen have proved theorems that show that any such use incoherent: Arrow argued that we cannot speak of &amp;lsquo;public will&amp;rsquo; in any coherent way; Sen argued that we cannot aggregateprivate preferences into a consistent and coherent set of &amp;lsquo;public preferences&amp;rsquo;. Our notion of &amp;lsquo;public interest&amp;rsquo; includes these two notions and, as a consequence, does not allow of a coherent conceptualization. Even banning smoking in public places (whatever the notion of a &amp;lsquo;public space&amp;rsquo; be) is not very coherent, if argued in terms of &amp;lsquo;public interest&amp;rsquo;. In this sense, justifying complex actions, which carry unintended consequences, in the name of public interest is not an interesting exercise. (b) Despite this, the idea of the state and its relation to public interest preoccupies people because of something else: that is the belief that every institution in society has an &amp;lsquo;interest&amp;rsquo; and the state has a &amp;lsquo;public interest&amp;rsquo;. That is, there is an underlying assumption of &amp;lsquo;intelligibility&amp;rsquo; to claims about &amp;ldquo;institutional interests&amp;rsquo;: each institution has an interest the way each individual has either a &amp;lsquo;desire&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;interest&amp;rsquo;. The more I read history, the less intelligible it has become to me. I believe that this claim is a &amp;lsquo;secular translation&amp;rsquo; of the idea that &lt;em&gt;the Christian Church has some set of interests&lt;/em&gt; and political thinking, since the Middle Ages in Europe, has so constantly hammered on this theme that it has become a trivial fact that we take for granted. It is totally unclear to me how we identify the &amp;lsquo;interests&amp;rsquo; of a social institution, the State included, and how we find out whether we are wrong or right in attributing such an &amp;lsquo;interest&amp;rsquo; to a social institution. In other words, we have no clue how we solve our disagreement in this area of legal and political philosophy: the more radical the disagreement, the less clear how we should solve the issue: suppose I deny that the State has any set of interests that it can call its own, how do we solve this disagreement? On the basis of some or another definition about what &amp;lsquo;interest&amp;rsquo; is or what &amp;lsquo;State&amp;rsquo; is?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Secularized Christian Theme: Moral Certainty and Proof Beyond a Reasonable Doubt</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Larry Laudan&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.academia.edu/805698/Is_Reasonable_Doubt_Reasonable&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;How Reasonable is &amp;lsquo;Proof Beyond a Reasonable Doubt&amp;rsquo;?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; (published in the journal Legal Theory), shows how the principle of proof beyond a reasonable doubt is utterly unreasonable when one analyzes it in terms of  epistemological standards. Laudan&amp;rsquo;s argument is convincing. The problem is it makes all these judges and lawyers look like &lt;em&gt;fools&lt;/em&gt;. Balu was not satisfied by Laudan&amp;rsquo;s pragmatic justification of proof  beyond a reasonable doubt (of 10 accused, the principle will lead to 9 being legitimately convicted and 1 innocent fellow going to the gallows). Interestingly, the advocacy of this legal principle often invokes a notion of &amp;lsquo;moral certainty&amp;rsquo;. It is as though when a group of 12 (?) jury members and a judge unanimously come to the decision that there is proof beyond a reasonable doubt, then the individual at the other end must be guilty of whatever he or she is accused of. Now, this attitude, Balu suggests, reflects the notion of conscience in the Christian religion. According to the theology of conscience, God has inscribed His Law for humanity in all human creatures. A few definitions can show what conscience means to Christians: &amp;ldquo;The conscience of man…Is a man&amp;rsquo;s judgement of himselfe, according to the judgement of God of him.&amp;rdquo; Or: &amp;ldquo;Conscience is that Power, or Faculty of the Mind, which judges of our Actions according to a right Rule, whether they be agreeable to it or not.&amp;rdquo; This rule is God&amp;rsquo;s Will. Conscience is called &amp;ldquo;that universal Monarch, whose Ubiquitary Throne is establish&amp;rsquo;d in every mortal Breast.&amp;rdquo; A Quaker writes that conscience is &amp;ldquo;an Ability in the Understanding of man, by a reflective act to judge of himself in all he does, as to his acceptance or rejection with God&amp;rdquo; and he adds that &amp;ldquo;this is the inward Rule he hath to walk by.&amp;rdquo; Before the fall, Adam had been perfectly good and even after the fall, humankind retained the knowledge of the perfectly good in contrast with evil. This perfect knowledge allowed man to distinguish &amp;ldquo;between Good and Evil,&amp;rdquo; and worked as &amp;ldquo;a constant witness to God in his soul, and by secret reference to what he was at firrst, tells him what he still ought to be.&amp;rdquo; The left-over of God&amp;rsquo;s Will in us after the Fall is what we still call conscience. In other words, conscience tells us how we ought to act according to God&amp;rsquo;s Will and judges every act of ours in relation to this norm. Given the belief that each individual conscience still reflects the Will of God to some extent (unless it is completely corrupted, but this the selection of jury members is supposed to prevent), the origin of the notions of moral certainty and proof beyond a reasonable doubt becomes clear. When so many good Christians agree on the guilt of the accused, it must be God&amp;rsquo;s Will speaking through their consciences. It is sickening to see how law&amp;rsquo;s reproduction of secularized Christian attitudes towards morality leads to the upholding of a silly principle in the American courts (and to the conviction of innocents).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Secularized Christian Belief: Religion is a cultural/human universal</title>
      <link>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/secularized-christian-belief-religion-is-a-culturalhuman-universal/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 03 Mar 2011 23:39:25 +0530</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/secularized-christian-belief-religion-is-a-culturalhuman-universal/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of these so-called secular accounts that are in fact Christian is the belief that all cultures have a religion. It is simply a secularization of the Christian belief that the biblical God gave religion to humankind, which was transformed into the assumption that religion is a cultural universal during the Enlightenment. This pre-theoretical assumption precedes all empirical research and theory-formation on religion and culture. From the early missionaries to the contemporary anthropologists, no one has ever even doubted that the phenomenon of religion is universal to all cultures. All psychological and sociological and even biological and neurological explanations of religion take this pre-theoretical Christian theological assumption as a starting point. Now, this is hardly scientific, isn&amp;rsquo;t it? In &lt;a href=&#34;http://sites.google.com/site/colonialconsciousness/theheatheninhisblindness&#34;&gt;his book &amp;lsquo;The Heathen in His Blindness: Asia, the West and the dynamic of religion&amp;rsquo;&lt;/a&gt;, Balagangadhara shows that the belief that all cultures have religion has more to do with the structure of the Christian religion than with the nature of human cultures. Furthermore, he develops a theory of religion which reveals that Christianity, Islam, and Judaism are at present the only instances of the phenomenon of religion. On top of that, he shows why those belonging to these religions and to the cultures they have created, are deeply inclined to believe that all human cultures must have a religion or at least a world view. The latter belief in the universality of religion is not a scientific hypothesis at all, but a religious doctrine. He also shows that the pagan traditions have a structure that is completely different from that of these three religions. In other words, the semitic religions and the pagan traditions are not variants of the same supposedly universal phenomenon of religion, rather they are &lt;strong&gt;different phenomena&lt;/strong&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Assuming that the distinction I &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/religious-intolerance-vs-civic-intolerance/&#34; title=&#34;Religious intolerance vs. civic intolerance I&#34;&gt;proposed&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;em&gt;civic tolerance&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;religious tolerance&lt;/em&gt; is acceptable, let us proceed further to analyze the notion of civic tolerance more closely. (I am simply assuming that it is desirable and that, from now on, we are talking about religious matters.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is (logically) possible that there could be religious intolerance and yet the believers in such religions could have the virtue of civic tolerance. That is to say, even (a) if there is religious intolerance, believers in some religion or another could have a society where there is civic tolerance. As suggested earlier, (b) religious tolerance implies the presence of civic tolerance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Can history-centrism &lt;em&gt;cause&lt;/em&gt; some religion or the other to be belief-based? The notion of &amp;ldquo;history-centrism&amp;rdquo; is too vague to allow a serious answer. In so far as this refers to a &amp;ldquo;Grand narrative&amp;rdquo;, and this narrative is either an oral or a written account, it is a &lt;em&gt;candidate&lt;/em&gt; for the status of &amp;lsquo;belief&amp;rsquo;. Consequently, your question takes the following form: &lt;em&gt;Does &amp;ldquo;believing in&amp;rdquo; the truth of some or another historical event cause a religion to base itself on &amp;ldquo;beliefs&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/em&gt; (The contrast term to &amp;ldquo;belief&amp;rdquo; will have to be attitude or action or event.) As Christians do, you might want to distinguish between &amp;ldquo;believing in&amp;rdquo; (a propositional attitude) and a set of &amp;ldquo;beliefs&amp;rdquo; (which are a set of propositions). In that case, the Christian stance is superior to your formulation: they say that &lt;em&gt;believing in&lt;/em&gt; God is primary with respect to the belief that &amp;ldquo;God exists&amp;rdquo; or that &amp;ldquo;Christ has come&amp;rdquo; or any such thing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Words like &amp;ldquo;inclusivism&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;exclusivism&amp;rdquo; etc. are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a part of my terminology. They are not only imprecise but also misleading. They have been used mostly as meta-descriptions of the stance that Christian theologies took with respect to other &lt;em&gt;religions&lt;/em&gt;. (To use these loaded notions, even when negatively qualified, to describe the Indian traditions is totally misleading and entirely wrong.) They are also useless to describe (in any accurate manner) the Christian religion because each of the above notions expresses a &lt;em&gt;specific solution&lt;/em&gt; to the Christological dilemma. My discussion of Christianity &lt;em&gt;as a religion&lt;/em&gt; is pitched at another level of abstraction than these notions permit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even if one insists (wrongly in my view) that I am suggesting that Alex Alexander is not a Christian, there are two ways of looking at the &lt;em&gt;object&lt;/em&gt; of my assertion: (a) it is about the &lt;em&gt;unique&lt;/em&gt; individual that Alex Alexander is; (b) it is about him in so far as he is an &lt;em&gt;instance&lt;/em&gt; of the tolerant Christianity that some Indian Churches are supposed to be.

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Today, in countries like England, Belgium, Germany, Italy and the United States, many religions (Judaism, Christianity, Islam) and many brands of some of these religions (Catholicism, Protestantism of various shades, Orthodox Churches, etc) coexist. In Belgium or Italy, for instance, the Catholic Christians do not &lt;em&gt;impose&lt;/em&gt; their faiths on those who are not Catholics, i.e., they do not go around &amp;ldquo;proselytizing&amp;rdquo; the non-Catholics in their countries; in The Netherlands and Germany, for instance, the Catholics and the Protestants do not go around assaulting each other the way they did during the period of Reformation. Even the Jehovah&amp;rsquo;s Witnesses do not &lt;em&gt;impose&lt;/em&gt; their faith, when they canvass the &amp;ldquo;Good Word&amp;rdquo; from door to door. The Muslims in Britain, for instance, do not go around converting all non-Muslims either. Questions: Does that mean that Catholic Christianity in Belgium and Italy (for instance) has become &lt;em&gt;more tolerant&lt;/em&gt; than it was couple of centuries ago? Does it mean that Protestantism has become &lt;em&gt;more tolerant&lt;/em&gt; than it was some three centuries or so ago? Does it mean that Islam in Britain (or in the United States) is &lt;em&gt;more tolerant&lt;/em&gt; than Islam, say, in Africa?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Or does it mean that these countries have become &lt;em&gt;more tolerant&lt;/em&gt; of the existence of several religions and religious denominations in the interstices of their society than they were a few centuries ago?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A Christian netizen says:&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;here is within exclusive religions the claim that theirs is the only way to God (that claim can be true or false). There is in inclusive religions the claim that there are several ways to God and that it is quite possible that one of the exclusive ones (or many of them) are also ways to God. Both these statements cannot be true at the same time iff the logical law of excluding the middle holds. I don&amp;rsquo;t think that I have come across a way around this except through it &amp;ndash; i.e. one of the claims must be false or worst case both are false (there is no God or there is no path yet).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;What is history? In the first place, it is the subject matter of historiography, which is what historians write. What does historiography talk about? The human past. In other words, there is a distinction to be made between &amp;rsquo;the past&amp;rsquo; and ways of talking about this past.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If this distinction (between &amp;rsquo;the past&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;ways of talking about it&amp;rsquo;) is accepted, then we can answer the question about what history is thus: it is a way of talking about the past&amp;ndash;a &amp;lsquo;scientific&amp;rsquo; way. That is, the truths of historiography are established using the methods and techniques widely accepted in that domain.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The past can be talked about not only by using historiographical methods, but also in different ways: the way stories, legends, drama, poetry, etc do. These are also ways of talking of the past but they lay no claims to being histories (or they do not claim to be &amp;lsquo;historiographies&amp;rsquo;).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;What is the status of the Bible? According to the Semitic religions, not only is it the word of God, but it also aspires to being &amp;lsquo;historiography&amp;rsquo;. Events like the revelation of the Biblical god, the covenant this god made with the people of Israel, the existence of Jesus of Nazareth, his claims to being the Christ, and such like are claimed to be not &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; events in the human past but, above all, as &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt; events. That is, they claim to be &lt;em&gt;historical events&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Consider the everyday &lt;em&gt;phenomenon&lt;/em&gt; of sunrise and sunset. We see the movement of the sun on the horizon and, for a very long period of time, people thought that they observed this because that is the way the reality is: the sun moves around the earth. With Galileo Galilei, two things happened. (a) He argued that the earth moves round the sun. (b) On the basis of this theory, he claimed that we are compelled to observe the movement of the sun around the earth. Because of this, a distinction became necessary: the movement of the sun is merely a phenomenon, whereas the movement of the earth is the real truth. What we previously thought as reality became downgraded to a mere appearance and something we did not know until then became the reality underlying this appearance.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, appearance is as much a part of Reality as the essence (or underlying reality, or whatever terminology you feel like using) is. So, we have three notions: appearance, the underlying reality, and the Reality that unites appearance with the underlying reality. (One might as well call them reality1, reality2 and reality3. But one does not do this because of the deep-rooted western &lt;em&gt;metaphysical assumption&lt;/em&gt; that there is only &lt;em&gt;one reality&lt;/em&gt;. However, since I do not want to quarrel with this assumption now, I will make no further remarks on this issue.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Regarding nonsense.&lt;/em&gt; I take it you mean that my claims are false or wrong. In that case, I would like to read your reasons. There is no point in simply saying something like that without telling which &lt;em&gt;other theory of religion&lt;/em&gt; does better than mine. Even if there are problems in my theory, I claim that this is the best theory we have in the market place. If you think differently, I would like you to tell us &lt;em&gt;the way in which&lt;/em&gt; any of the competitor theories in the market place does better. Of course, as a scientist, I do know (and accept) at a meta-level that all my claims are &lt;em&gt;hypothetical and tentative.&lt;/em&gt; I very honestly hope to see and greet, before I die, a &lt;em&gt;much better theory&lt;/em&gt; of religion than the one I am developing. Such a process will come into being, if people like you discuss the theory in a critical but rational way. It will not, if people continue nit-picking and come up with irrelevant criticisms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Logic of normative ethics: Immorality</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Why does one bring up the issue of one&amp;rsquo;s grandmother&amp;rsquo;s judgment about a clerk taking bribes as a counter-example? First, what do I say? That he &lt;em&gt;calls&lt;/em&gt; it as corruption has to do with western normative ethics. Does it follow from this that the action of the municipal clerk is ethically &lt;em&gt;good?&lt;/em&gt; It does not, unless one assumes either (a) I am presenting an &lt;em&gt;alternate&lt;/em&gt; moral principle, which will make the action of the clerk morally good; or that (b) the only morality that will make the action of the clerk ethically bad is the one that construes it as corruption. I am not presenting an alternate moral rule that justifies the action of the clerk. But I want to know why the so-called corruption comes about and whether it is that. My attempt at doing this is &lt;em&gt;assumed&lt;/em&gt; to make the action of the clerk or the building contractor morally good. Why this assumption? I suggest that it comes about because of the assumption (b).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The universalisability of norms does not mean that the western people all factually follow these norms. Even if everyone were to lie, the ethical statement &amp;ldquo;No one ought to lie&amp;rdquo; is a universal moral statement.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The existence of &lt;em&gt;debates&lt;/em&gt; about abortion, war, etc. is indicative of the nature of normative rules. Because &amp;ldquo;one ought not to kill&amp;rdquo;, debates and doctrines about &amp;ldquo;justified war&amp;rdquo; come into being. It is important to note that these doctrines do not contradict the injunction not to kill but provide justifications for undertaking such an immoral action. (They provide, so to speak, the mitigating circumstances.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The &amp;lsquo;corruption&amp;rsquo; refers to the social phenomenon in India which makes about 20% of the adult population into immoral people. When I said that I refuse to call the clerk &amp;lsquo;corrupt&amp;rsquo; or that the issue I raise is anterior, I am talking about this phenomenon. One uses the word &amp;lsquo;cheating&amp;rsquo; (something like the Hindi &amp;lsquo;Dhoka&amp;rsquo; probably). One could, for instance, use this word to describe the individual action of the clerk as an unethical one without &lt;em&gt;making&lt;/em&gt; it into corruption.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Are these two conversationally synonymous? I suppose it depends on the person with whom you are having a conversation, the context and the language used.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Is relative ethics coherent?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Does the notion of &amp;ldquo;relative ethics&amp;rdquo; make sense within the context of the western ethics? There are some attempts to develop &amp;ldquo;ethical relativism&amp;rdquo;, even though it is not clear what is relativistic about them. One would be a kind of factual claim: different people, different groups, different cultures have different principles which they consider as &amp;ldquo;morally good&amp;rdquo;. This does not make for ethical relativism. The issue still remains: are these principles also ethically good? That is to say, one undertakes a &amp;rsquo;normative&amp;rsquo; enquiry in order to find out whether all these principles are also morally acceptable. The second would be to come up with a moral norm that is &amp;lsquo;relative&amp;rsquo; to some person or group. Any examination would very quickly lead to the conclusion that, in so far as it is a norm, it is universalizable even if the &lt;em&gt;domain of objects&lt;/em&gt; appears restricted. (That is because all &amp;lsquo;universal&amp;rsquo; laws specify the domain of objects, whether implicitly or explicitly, where they are applicable. The &amp;lsquo;relativistic&amp;rsquo; norms appear relativistic because they specify the domain explicitly.) In other words, no one has been able to come up with any coherent explication of what &amp;lsquo;relativistic ethics&amp;rsquo; means. (According to me, it is impossible to do so when we speak of normative ethics.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The inability of the Chinese language to express counterfactuals is even more intriguing. As you know, Confucius wrote his &amp;ldquo;Analects&amp;rdquo; in the Classical Chinese language. In order to see where I am heading, consider some of the thoughts that Rosemont, Jr. expresses. (Rosemont, Jr., H., &amp;ldquo;Against Relativism.&amp;rdquo; In Larson G. J. and E. Deutsch (eds.), &lt;em&gt;Interpreting Across Boundaries: New Essays in Comparative Philosophy&lt;/em&gt;. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1988) Not only is there an absence of the concept of &amp;lsquo;morality&amp;rsquo; in the Classical Chinese, but also the very cluster of concepts required to speak about moral issues.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Are western traditions innately richer because they have the moral ought?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My answer: No. In fact, in my book on ethics I will prove the following: the non-normative ethics are &lt;em&gt;richer:&lt;/em&gt; Under specific assumptions, in limited conditions, one can &lt;em&gt;derive&lt;/em&gt; a normative ethics from a non-normative one. The relation between non-normative ethics and normative ethics is analogous to the relation between Einsteinian theory and Newtonian theory: under specific assumptions, in limited conditions, you can derive the Newtonian theory from the Einsteinian theory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The first thing to note is that there is no distance between how we use corruption in our daily language and the way it is used in political and sociological theories of corruption. You see, the problem we (Indians) face is the asymmetry &lt;em&gt;in the way the word is used&lt;/em&gt; while talking about us and the way it is used when talking about India. I want to signal this by putting up the red flag: I want to suggest the reader not to assume the truth of these descriptions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Is the division between the West and East Orientalist in nature? Well, that is what Edward Said says in his Orientalism; that is what many writers in his wake say too. I beg to disagree. Let me make but three points. One: that there is an Indian culture and a western culture has been established in my book. (Of course, it is also an experiential given.) Consequently, I have just presumed this distinction here. Second: some distinction does not become Orientalist just because the Orientalist thinkers use the distinction. Thirdly: that there exist empirical distinctions of culture etc. is not &lt;em&gt;denied&lt;/em&gt; by Edward Said but only that speaking about these distinctions leads to violence. A rather funny stance, to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Let us say that &amp;lsquo;X&amp;rsquo; does something which &amp;lsquo;Y&amp;rsquo; considers corrupt. To keep it simple, let us say that &amp;lsquo;Y&amp;rsquo; expresses the aforementioned judgment. In order to express it, or persuade others about the validity of this moral judgment, &amp;lsquo;Y&amp;rsquo; will have to do something like this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Y defines &amp;lsquo;corruption&amp;rsquo;: &amp;ldquo;All actions which exhibit _______ properties are corrupt&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Y&amp;rsquo;s &amp;rsquo;ethical principle&amp;rsquo; (itself justified): &amp;ldquo;All actions which satisfy ______ (the principle) are moral&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The first thing that is really striking involves what I will call the &lt;em&gt;burden of proof&lt;/em&gt;. That is, I am being asked to prove that my assertions about corruption are true. In one sense, it appears an entirely reasonable demand to make: after all, one should not entertain gratuitous claims. But what seems to have escaped the attention of many is this: what precisely do I have to prove? Who has the burden of proof?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1.1. Let us strip the issue to its barest form. I am supposed to prove that we Indians are not corrupt, immoral and/or moral imbeciles. Without proof, is it difficult to accept these claims? But who has proved that we are any or all of these things? Not the western theorists, surely. Not any Indian either. All that exist are bare-bone assertions that some moral principles are violated in a systematic fashion in India. So, what exactly do I have to prove?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The first question: &amp;ldquo;By saying that there exist &amp;ldquo;Western&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Indian&amp;rdquo; cultures aren&amp;rsquo;t you somehow essentializing cultures into monoliths?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I do not see how. When we talk of &amp;rsquo;the human species&amp;rsquo; (in the singular), or about &amp;rsquo;life&amp;rsquo; (again in the singular) while doing evolutionary biology, we do not presuppose or imply that either of the two is a monolithic entity, do we? In fact, &lt;em&gt;diversity&lt;/em&gt; is a presupposition for any kind of knowledge and this is my presupposition as well. I presuppose (and my theory requires) diversity in both the Indian and the western culture. Without it, one cannot test the theories.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Our proverbial municipal clerk would be immoral, and it would disprove the sentence (1). The same example could also confirm sentence (3); an instance of a moral act would also be a counter-example.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the striking things about the British colonial rule is its success in developing certain ways of talking about the Indian culture and society. The British criticised the Indian &amp;lsquo;religions&amp;rsquo;, the Indian &amp;lsquo;caste system&amp;rsquo;, the Indian education system, practices like &amp;lsquo;sati&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;untouchability&amp;rsquo;, and so on and so forth. They redrew the outlines of Indian intellectual history as indigenous responses to some of the ills they saw in the Indian society and culture: for example, &amp;lsquo;Buddhism&amp;rsquo;, as it emerged out of their reconstruction, was a revolt against &amp;lsquo;Brahmanism&amp;rsquo; and &amp;rsquo;the caste system&amp;rsquo;. Many Indian intellectuals emphasized British criticism by making &amp;rsquo;truths&amp;rsquo; in the latter their own: the Arya Samaj, the Brahmo Samaj, many Hindu &amp;lsquo;reform&amp;rsquo; movements, and so on exemplify this trend. I say &amp;rsquo;truths&amp;rsquo; and place it in scare quotes because the &lt;em&gt;unbroken line of continuity&lt;/em&gt; between the colonial period and the one following the Indian independence raises two &lt;em&gt;kinds&lt;/em&gt; of questions. The first is this: would there have been such a line of continuity if there was no &amp;rsquo;truth&amp;rsquo; to the British portrayal of our history, traditions, and culture? This question uses the &amp;lsquo;fact&amp;rsquo; of continuity to suggest that the British descriptions &lt;em&gt;could be &amp;rsquo;true&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/em&gt; That is, our current experience of our culture and society appears to lend truth-value to the colonial descriptions of India. The second question transforms our &amp;lsquo;current experience&amp;rsquo; itself into a problem: does such a line of continuity indicate that our experiences themselves are still colonial in nature? This question throws doubts upon the &amp;lsquo;facticity&amp;rsquo; of the British descriptions of India, and suggests that they &lt;em&gt;could be &amp;lsquo;untrue&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/em&gt; In the process, it also challenges us to look more closely and investigate our own experiences today. That is, the second question withholds assent to the &amp;rsquo;truth&amp;rsquo; &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; of the colonial descriptions of India and of some of the claims we make about our experiences of our culture and society today. To some extent, and only to some extent, the so-called &amp;lsquo;post-colonial&amp;rsquo; writings can be seen as attempts to make sense of the second question. Even though I do not fancy the label of being a &amp;lsquo;post-colonial&amp;rsquo; myself, I perceive a shared sense of a quest with them. &lt;em&gt;There is something deeply, deeply wrong with the line of continuity that exists between the colonial period and today&amp;rsquo;s India,&lt;/em&gt; and the challenge is to say what it is.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What is western normative ethics? It is a structure or style of thinking about ethics. What is its structure? It makes use of norms. What are norms? &amp;lsquo;Rules&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;principles&amp;rsquo; which have a characteristic structure that use certain concepts like the moral &amp;lsquo;ought&amp;rsquo; and moral &amp;lsquo;ought not&amp;rsquo;. That is, some actions &lt;em&gt;ought&lt;/em&gt; to be performed (i.e. they are obligatory); some actions &lt;em&gt;ought not&lt;/em&gt; to be performed (i.e. they are forbidden) and some actions are neither of the two (i.e. they are permitted). What is important to note is that these norms (i.e. for example, some action is obligatory) hold irrespective of time, place, condition or the person. In other words, norms are supposed to hold universally. From what I have said above, it logically follows that violation (or transgressing) some moral norm or the other is immoral (or unethical) and following some moral norm is moral (or ethical).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Symbolic interpretation of lingam from a netizen&lt;/strong&gt;: &amp;ldquo;In ancient India, there was a fertility cult; our ancestors &lt;em&gt;knew&lt;/em&gt; that it was a fertility cult; Lingam was a symbol for the phallus then; it continues to be one even when many millions are ignorant of this now; and that the Modern Indians&amp;rsquo; attitude to sex is inhibiting because of which they do not see the symbolism.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To keep the contrast between us stark, here is what I say: Lingam is not a symbol of anything or anybody. Lingam is &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; Shiva&amp;rsquo;s puja is done (as against, say, how we do puja to Vishnu) by the Indians. You tell me that this &lt;em&gt;factual claim&lt;/em&gt; is wrong and that by saying what I have just said, I project my present to &amp;rsquo;explain&amp;rsquo; the past.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I do not want to indulge in a discussion about Behavioral Psychology either on this forum or on any other forum. It is to waste of time I do not have. Let me very briefly state where I stand with respect to that discipline. In its early days, it was useful in providing some insights into animal behavior. I share the dominant consensus regarding its status today: it is obsolete. It does not quite have the status of &amp;lsquo;phlogiston theory&amp;rsquo; but it is pretty close to the latter. I have suffered through many writings of Skinner and his disciples, but I have neither the time nor the interest to discuss their &amp;rsquo;theories&amp;rsquo; now. This means, I am going to skip over issues involving &amp;lsquo;shaping&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;conditioning&amp;rsquo; and such like.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Assuming that our theories in Physics are not false, would there be gravitational force in the Cosmos (or on our planet) whether or not there was a theory about it? This is the question about the &amp;rsquo;truth&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;objectivity&amp;rsquo; of our theories. If we say &amp;lsquo;yes&amp;rsquo;, I do not see how one can say the opposite, then the truth or falsity of, say, Aristotelian theory is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; dependent on the &amp;lsquo;consumer&amp;rsquo; of that theory. Of course, once upon a time, people believed it was true but this &amp;lsquo;belief&amp;rsquo; does not &lt;em&gt;make&lt;/em&gt; Aristotle&amp;rsquo;s theory true. (In Western Europe, people once believed that witches not only exist, but that they also had sexual intercourse with the Devil. There were &amp;rsquo;eye witnesses&amp;rsquo;, who provided graphic descriptions of the sexual organ and sexual prowess of the Devil. We would be hard put to call it &amp;rsquo;true&amp;rsquo; today in Europe or in India around the same time, irrespective of what these people thought then.) That human beings believe different stories to be true, which later turn out to be false, does not make &amp;rsquo;truth&amp;rsquo; relative to an audience. What it does is to make the belief-in-the-truth-of-a-theory relative to the &amp;lsquo;consumer&amp;rsquo;. This is the issue about the &amp;lsquo;objectivity&amp;rsquo; of theories. That is: could we have theories about human beings and cultures that are &amp;lsquo;objective&amp;rsquo; in this sense? I think so. That is why the discussion with Wendy and her children: they are not producing &lt;em&gt;knowledge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Criticism: you are peddling a ‘wannabe Indianism’!</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Is there a &amp;lsquo;wannabe Indianism&amp;rsquo; in our attempts to understand our tradition? I am not sure: maybe there is, maybe there is not. Of course, the question is why is this relevant? Whatever the motives or the contexts of any individual writer why should that be an argument for either accepting or rejecting or even putting his opinions on hold? The way I see it, the nature of the phenomenon is of another level altogether: I think that the intellectuals from India will increasingly be confronted with the question of what it is to be an Indian. There are many reasons for it: the political, the social, the economic as well as cultural. In fact, I think that this is not merely an Indian phenomenon but an Asian one. Today, the centre of gravity (in economic, geo-political terms) is slowly shifting towards Asia, a non-white, non-Christian culture. That is why you and I (and many others like us) are discussing these issues passionately. To us, these issues are not &amp;lsquo;abstract&amp;rsquo;; it is very much a part of our daily life (in the appropriate sense of the term). When I was started working on these issues some two decades ago, I could count the number of interested people on the fingers of my one hand. Today, two decades later, look at what is happening: we are discussing, with a passion born out of our daily experiences, what appears from the outside as &lt;em&gt;esoteric&lt;/em&gt; issues. But it is not &amp;rsquo;esoteric&amp;rsquo; to us, is it? I think the scale, depth, and the intensity of these discussions (both in India and outside) transcend any &amp;lsquo;wannabe Indian&amp;rsquo; motive.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Is the distinction between ‘secular’and ‘religious’ neutral? –S.N. Balagangadhara</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The question appears to be: need one accept certain premises of Christianity (whether Protestant or Catholic varieties) in order that the dominant understanding of, say, the secular state and the caste to make sense? That those to whom such accounts make sense do not explicitly subscribe to the premises of a specific religious appears to throw doubt on our claims.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Consider the very distinction between &amp;rsquo;the religious&amp;rsquo; and &amp;rsquo;the secular&amp;rsquo;. Historically, Christianity has drawn this line. (Theologians have spent much ink over the last two thousand years drawing, defending, and elaborating upon this distinction.) It is also the case that political thinkers in the West, some of whom were militantly atheistic, have made this distinction into a cornerstone of their theories. Further, many Indian thinkers, most of whom know very little of Christian theologies, base their arguments on these and allied distinctions. The existence of the last two groups appears to tell us that even when one rejects some or all religions, even when one is utterly oblivious to the histories and theologies of the Christianities, this distinction does make sense.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Summary of Lorenzen&amp;rsquo;s article: &amp;ldquo;Lorenzen doesn&amp;rsquo;t only cite Jesuits and Muslims, but also &amp;lsquo;Hindus&amp;rsquo; themselves. His main argument is that Hinduism isn&amp;rsquo;t an invention by anyone in particular. It grew out of a need to establish an identity vis-à-vis foreigners (mlecchas). In other words, an identity by contrast with the &amp;lsquo;others.&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is a world of difference between what one wants to argue and what one, in fact, argues. The above (accurate) summary literally begs all the questions the article intends to solve.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Let us call the descriptions of what you see &amp;lsquo;facts&amp;rsquo;. Are your &amp;lsquo;facts&amp;rsquo; a contribution to human knowledge? In one sense they are; the way any description of anything by anybody is a &amp;lsquo;fact&amp;rsquo; and thus knowledge. One needs, and one has, a way of not wanting to call every piece of &amp;lsquo;fact&amp;rsquo; as knowledge. Hence, we can reformulate the issue: does it contribute towards building a scientific theory of cultural differences? Do your observations in some African country tell us what &lt;em&gt;makes&lt;/em&gt; their drinking habits and body decorations into a cultural difference? And how these and other differences allow us to say what the &amp;lsquo;African culture&amp;rsquo; is? In other words, not every fact, because it is a fact about people from another culture, is interesting from the point of view of building a scientific theory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;About who the &amp;lsquo;authentic Hind&amp;rsquo; or &amp;rsquo;the authentic Indian&amp;rsquo; is. The greatest strength of our culture lies in the fact that this is a non-question as far as our traditions are concerned. Even though I have now spent nearly as many years outside India as I have spent inside, I do not feel an &amp;lsquo;outsider&amp;rsquo;. Nor am I considered as one by the members my family, for instance, most of whom have never left India in their lives.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Let me lay this fear to rest: I am &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; speaking for the community. To the question, &amp;lsquo;Who speaks for the Indian traditions?&amp;rsquo; my reply is simple: &lt;em&gt;anyone, everyone, whoever feels like&lt;/em&gt;. (Of course, I do not consider the question very sensible, but that is a side-issue for the moment.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Having said this much, let me also say that my discussion with Jeffrey Kripal is not about the moral right to speak in the name of the community but whether such speeches &lt;em&gt;constitute knowledge&lt;/em&gt;. In other words, I &lt;em&gt;evaluate&lt;/em&gt; what someone says about the Indian traditions for its veracity and it is here that I find Kripal falling way short.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You ask us not to &amp;lsquo;judge&amp;rsquo;. It is not clear what the force of judgment is to which you object. When I listen to someone (today) insisting that the earth is flat or that the Sun revolves round the earth, I judge that this person (in all probability) does not have much of an idea about the physical theories. Because I am not sure, I try to find out what his arguments are. If they do not cognitively satisfy me, I judge that he is wrong. I do not see what is wrong with this kind of judgment. Equally, I do judge that Hitler is an immoral human being. I do not see what is wrong with this kind of moral judgment either. You might want to say that one ought not to judge the &amp;lsquo;worth&amp;rsquo; of a person. Frankly, I do not understand what such a sentiment wants to say. I cannot judge whether the life of some X or Y is worth living, simply because I have no way of judging it either way. Nor can I say anything about the worth of human existence. (From which perspective? The cosmic perspective?) If some person were to ask me whether it makes any difference to the Cosmos whether the human race exists or not, I would not know how to go about answering this question. Consequently, any answer will do as far as I am concerned.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a way, and in some sense, I do agree with you that one&amp;rsquo;s acquaintance with a culture is useful in writing about that culture. It is not sufficient, of course (think of the nonsense written by most anthropologists during the last 100 years on other cultures); nor are there any compelling reasons to believe that it is a sine qua non to understanding cultures. However, I am not challenging the claim that the context of the person might be relevant to producing knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Is the model of games useful in understanding evolution of some aspect of society? If you use &amp;lsquo;games&amp;rsquo; in a very, very general sense (viz. there are players, strategies, end-results, and such like), then it might. There is a flourishing branch of mathematics called &amp;lsquo;Game theory&amp;rsquo; that has been used to study many things in nature and society: from the evolution of rules and norms to seeing evolution itself in Game-theoretic terms. I need to warn you that its notion of games is a technical one and involves two or more &amp;lsquo;players&amp;rsquo;, who follow certain strategies for &amp;lsquo;winning&amp;rsquo; to which a certain pay-off is coupled. While it has uncovered certain interesting dilemmas in societies, I do not find it as fruitful as its practitioners claim.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I do not see why I have to study the history of the last 4000 years to understand modern India. To the extent past becomes relevant (my research into some particular question will tell me whether the past is relevant, if so which part of the past is relevant, and how far I need to go in understanding the issue I want to understand), only to that extent do I need to study the past. The general statement &amp;lsquo;we are what we are because of the past&amp;rsquo; is true. But this is also a general statement. How far into my &amp;lsquo;past&amp;rsquo; do you need to go in order to understand my present? That depends on which part of the present you want to understand and what this &amp;lsquo;understanding&amp;rsquo; means in the context of your research. The same applies to a study of cultures and societies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Criticism: you are ‘Westernized’!</title>
      <link>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/criticism-you-are-westernized/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 02 Mar 2011 07:11:14 +0530</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/criticism-you-are-westernized/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;About the possibility that I was already &amp;lsquo;westernized&amp;rsquo; by the time I became a teenager. Even this question is wrongly posed. I am not claiming that there is some &amp;lsquo;authentic&amp;rsquo; Indian culture, which lives somewhere or lived some when in India. Such a culture, even if it exists or existed, does not concern me. I am interested in the Indian culture as it &lt;em&gt;exists&lt;/em&gt; today: including the aftermath of the Islamic and the British colonization. I am child of &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; culture, and this is the one I am trying to understand. The Indian &amp;lsquo;Diaspora&amp;rsquo; in the US is &lt;em&gt;as much&lt;/em&gt; Indian as some peasant living somewhere in a far-off village in India; they both belong to the Indian culture. Neither this peasant nor the Indians in the US is &amp;lsquo;more Indian&amp;rsquo; than the other. My problem is not: who is the &amp;lsquo;authentic&amp;rsquo; Indian or what is the &amp;lsquo;authentic&amp;rsquo; Indian culture? My question is about the 21st century India, and its present culture, which has absorbed many things, adapted many things from other cultures in many different ways. It is this set of Indian traditions that interests me. Was I &amp;lsquo;westernized&amp;rsquo; by the time I was a teenager? Who knows, or even who cares? What would it mean to say that I was &amp;lsquo;authentically&amp;rsquo; Indian or that I was &amp;lsquo;quasi-westernized&amp;rsquo;? Surely, the issue is not about some kind of &amp;lsquo;purity&amp;rsquo; here. What else is it? Consequently, when I speak of my past, I speak of the past of those who were brought up like me. If we were all partly &amp;lsquo;westernized&amp;rsquo;, then the culture I am talking about is this &amp;lsquo;partly westernized&amp;rsquo; Indian culture. An age long gone by, if it ever existed, does not give me sleepless nights; what does is what is happening now. Thus, when I say I want to understand Indian culture, I am not harking back to some &amp;lsquo;golden age&amp;rsquo;, my friend, but India as I know it today. To understand this India, I need to understand how her traditions are &lt;em&gt;lived&lt;/em&gt; today, not what they perhaps meant one thousand years ago.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Vacuity of Essentialism?—S.N.Balagangadhara</title>
      <link>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/vacuity-of-essentialism-s-n-balagangadhara/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 02 Mar 2011 03:40:23 +0530</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/vacuity-of-essentialism-s-n-balagangadhara/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have had difficulties in understanding the use and meaning of some words, especially &amp;rsquo;essentialism&amp;rsquo; and its cognates. Here are some uses of &amp;ldquo;essentialism&amp;rdquo; I am familiar with.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;One uses &amp;rsquo;essences&amp;rsquo; to designate some basic or fundamental or determining properties of an object, as in: &amp;ldquo;Water is essentially H2O&amp;rdquo;. Here the claim is that some liquid is water if and only if it has the chemical structure of containing two molecules of Hydrogen and one molecule of Oxygen for every single molecule of the liquid in question.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;One uses &amp;rsquo;essences&amp;rsquo; in order to understand counterfactual sentences involving proper nouns, as in: &amp;ldquo;If I were George Bush, I would not have gone to war with Iraq&amp;rdquo;. This sentence is a counterfactual because it begins by assuming a non-fact (I am Balu and not George Bush); picks out a state of affairs where this is true (a possible world where &amp;lsquo;Balu&amp;rsquo; IS &amp;lsquo;George Bush&amp;rsquo;) and makes a (true or false) statement about this (I might or might not have gone to war with Iraq). Many historical claims (and many scientific laws) have the form of counterfactual statements. Here &amp;rsquo;essence&amp;rsquo; is predicated to Balu (something like &amp;ldquo;baluhood&amp;rdquo;) so that Balu remains Balu even if he were to become &amp;lsquo;George Bush&amp;rsquo; in some possible world.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;One uses &amp;rsquo;essences&amp;rsquo; to solve the problem of providing references to proper names, as in &amp;ldquo;Socrates was not a teacher of Plato&amp;rdquo;. In many cases, we identify Socrates as that person who has the property of &amp;lsquo;being a teacher of Plato&amp;rsquo;. If it transpires that such is not the case, we will still not be in doubt about the identity of Socrates because, much like the previous case, it speaks about some &amp;rsquo;essential property&amp;rsquo; of Socrates by virtue of which he remains the same person even when he does not have some or another accidental or contingent property.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;One uses &amp;rsquo;essences&amp;rsquo; while solving the puzzle of identity, as in &amp;ldquo;This is me, a photograph taken when I was three years old&amp;rdquo;. Here, &amp;lsquo;me, when I was three years old&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;me in America during the 1990 AAR conference&amp;rsquo; etc. become spatio-temporal slices of an &amp;lsquo;I&amp;rsquo;. The &amp;lsquo;I&amp;rsquo; has indefinitely many spatio-temporal slices and these are all slices of one and the same &amp;lsquo;I&amp;rsquo;. The idea is that one does not become someone else other than who one is because of the spatio-temporal career of &amp;lsquo;oneself&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even though there are many discussions about each of these uses, there is nothing wrong or illegitimate about using the word &amp;rsquo;essence&amp;rsquo; or indeed to &amp;ldquo;talk in an essentializing way&amp;rdquo;. Quite obviously, the &amp;lsquo;subaltern&amp;rsquo; historiographers could not mean &amp;rsquo;essentialism&amp;rsquo; in any of the above senses, because they suggest that essentialism is something to avoid. I know of one such use of the word in Said&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Orientalism&amp;rdquo;, where he suggests that to correlate climatic conditions with the psychology or culture of a people (something that often happened in the eighteenth nineteenth centuries) is to commit the sin of essentialism. Clearly, this is not the kind of essentialism that is at issue here.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

If &amp;lsquo;puja&amp;rsquo; translated as &amp;lsquo;worship&amp;rsquo;, quite obviously one translates &amp;lsquo;pujya&amp;rsquo; as you do.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You see, what is at stake is not a mere &amp;rsquo;translation&amp;rsquo; problem.  It has to do with how the Indian culture (and not merely this one culture, I might add) has been, and continues to be, represented not just by Western intellectuals but also by the Indian intellectuals themselves. Let me give you an example, which should give you a sense of the nature of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is true that the modern Jewish thought, which is more influenced by the Rabbinic than by apocalyptic or Qumranic literature, places less emphasis on the Devil. Rabbinic Judaism was less interested in building a demonology than others. It is one thing to say this, but quite another to say that the Judaic tradition knows of the Devil only in terms of the psychological &amp;lsquo;inclinations&amp;rsquo; in man. (It is equivalent to suggesting that there is no demonology in Judaic thought, a preposterous suggestion on any count.) Belial, Mastema, Azazel, Satanail, Sammael, Semyzza, or Satan do not name either psychological or spiritual &amp;lsquo;inclinations&amp;rsquo;, surely. (Think further of what Behemoth, Leviathan, etc. are). The Satan in the Book of Job is already an emissary of God (though not yet the personification of evil), and not a mere &amp;lsquo;inclination&amp;rsquo;. The Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs name Belial or Satan as Chief of evil angels commanding the spirits of wrath, hatred, etc. and as lord of war, fornication, bloodshed, destruction, etc. He tempts and seduces humankind to error.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by Mujeeb&amp;rsquo;s objection to calling the Islamic people &amp;lsquo;Mohammedans&amp;rsquo;. Mujib&amp;rsquo;s objection was that the Muslims do not worship Mohammed, and Naseem spoke of it as an insulting appellation. They are right, of course, but they did not appear to get the authentic problem posed by a Raghavan and a Seshadri: surely &amp;lsquo;Mohammedans&amp;rsquo; are those who follow the doctrines (or teachings) of Mohammed. Marxists, Buddhists, and even Christians were called in to bolster the applicability of such a language-use. Despite the acrimonious sphere among the participants, there is a very, very deep reason why neither understands the other&amp;rsquo;s question.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Multiple meanings: puja, thondam—S.N. Balagangadhara</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;About the multiple meanings for the Puja of Ganesha. Of course, there is no one &amp;lsquo;meaning&amp;rsquo; to this act either now, or before, or in the future, as far as Indians (and the Westerners) are concerned. But that is not being disputed. The dispute arises when some meaning is alleged to portray the &amp;rsquo;experience&amp;rsquo; of a culture, when all it does is distort and deny the experience it is said to portray. However, there is an interesting question here, which is best illustrated using a contrast. In the Catholic Mass, there are &lt;em&gt;limits&lt;/em&gt; on what it could be said to mean to a believer. These limits are set by the Catholic theology and belief. (For instance, to a believer, it &lt;em&gt;cannot&lt;/em&gt; mean celebrating the Devil.) The puja of Ganesha does not set any such limits to the person who does this puja. (But if someone comes and tells me that I cook sweets on Ganesha Chaturthi because it expresses my &amp;lsquo;subconscious&amp;rsquo; desire for Oral Sex, I am justified in challenging this claim as an &amp;rsquo;explanation&amp;rsquo; of my cooking the sweets.) Here is the question: what is puja in the Indian traditions, if it does not have a particular meaning, and there are no limits on what it means? One thing is already clear: it cannot mean &amp;lsquo;worship&amp;rsquo;! These are the kind of questions I would like to ask; not what &amp;lsquo;interpretation&amp;rsquo; one gives to some action or the other. The answer I give should be capable of being &amp;rsquo;tested&amp;rsquo; in the Indian culture. Then, I will have begun producing an &amp;lsquo;objective&amp;rsquo; theory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Is Rain dance superstitious?—Willem Derde</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some consider it to be a &amp;ldquo;superstitious practice&amp;rdquo;, the implication being that it is irrational to believe that dancing &lt;em&gt;causes&lt;/em&gt; the rain to fall: no reasonable people on earth can buy the story that dancing actually causes rain to fall. I am not willing to buy it. However, it is a fact that in some cultures people &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; perform &amp;lsquo;rain dances&amp;rsquo;. However, to explain the &amp;lsquo;rain dance&amp;rsquo; by attributing a &amp;lsquo;causative story&amp;rsquo; is to trivialize such an experience: &lt;em&gt;you are transforming the members of that group into a bunch of idiots.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Every one of us believes our own viewpoint to be the best one: such is human nature.&amp;rdquo; This is not quite how I would put it. Let me, therefore say what I think with respect to this issue.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Whenever I formulate a theory, I believe that my description is &amp;rsquo;true&amp;rsquo;. If I thought that it was &amp;lsquo;false&amp;rsquo;, I would not write what I write. This is a belief about the status of my description and its relationship to the part of reality I describe. Let us call this the &amp;lsquo;object-level&amp;rsquo; belief.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Simulation of social and cultural changes?—S.N. Balagangadhara</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A question: Is it desirable to have a model that can simulate social and cultural changes?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I cannot see what good reason there is not to find it desirable. It would be eminently desirable. It will take some time though before we get there, but we will surely get there. Thanks to computers, we have a possibility of talking realistically about simulation. However, we have to still go a very long way before we are able to do so. We need to build some theories about social and cultural change and evolution; we need to develop suitable algorithms for simulating these changes; we need to develop more and different kinds of logics (non-monotonic ones) than exist today; we need to simulate some relevant aspects of human reasoning process … It is only now that we are &lt;em&gt;beginning&lt;/em&gt; to simulate the evolutionary process and have developed some kinds of algorithms to do so. We need to overlay this with developments (hardly understood today) about social dynamics and cultural dynamics. And then study what could happen. So, it is definitely going to take some time. In all probability, we will first start simulating some fragments of social or cultural reality first (after all, this is what modeling means).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It appears that Sir Isaac Newton was frequently complimented for being the greatest genius the world had ever known. One of his replies is alleged to have been the following: &amp;ldquo;Even a pygmy sees further than the giants if he stands upon their shoulders. And I, Sir, stand upon the shoulders of giants.&amp;rdquo; The extraordinary humility apart, there is something very important to what Newton is saying: his theory would not have been there, if the theories of Copernicus and Galileo were not there before him. It is, of course, a historical accident that certain people preceded Newton. This allowed Newton, however, to write his Principia.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How to produce knowledge about people and their cultures?—S.N. Balagangadhara</title>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Let us begin in a very intuitive way and ask ourselves this question: where do we encounter &amp;lsquo;cultural differences&amp;rsquo;? In human contacts, of course. What kind of human contacts? &lt;em&gt;In inter-individual contacts&lt;/em&gt;. That is, we see (or sense, or intuit or whatever) cultural differences in our contacts with &lt;em&gt;individual&lt;/em&gt; human beings. You do not meet &amp;rsquo;the western culture&amp;rsquo; but individual Americans, Germans, French, etc. Neither do these individuals meet &amp;rsquo;the Indian culture&amp;rsquo;: they meet individual Indians (or, even better, a &amp;lsquo;Madrasi Brahmin&amp;rsquo;, a &amp;lsquo;Gujerati Baniya&amp;rsquo; - even these are general categories but I use them just to get the point across.) And yet, we appear to see cultural differences in these contacts. How to make &amp;lsquo;sense&amp;rsquo; of &lt;em&gt;this experience&lt;/em&gt;? Let us first see what is partially involved to truly appreciate the complexity of our &amp;lsquo;perception&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1.1. Each individual human being is a complex combination of at least four aspects. There is his biological (or genetic) inheritance; there is his &amp;lsquo;social&amp;rsquo; inheritance (whether he is from the Middle Ages or from a capitalist society); there is his psychological makeup (let us say his &amp;lsquo;personality&amp;rsquo;); and there is his cultural upbringing (whether he is a Madhva Brahmin or a Lingayat, say). When we meet individuals, in many different ways we notice these &lt;em&gt;differences&lt;/em&gt;: the biological, the psychological and, after some time perhaps, &amp;rsquo;the social&amp;rsquo; and &amp;rsquo;the cultural&amp;rsquo;. Let us bracket the biological away so that the situation becomes deliciously complex. Let us agree to use the following &amp;lsquo;words&amp;rsquo; (they are just words for now) in order to go ahead and raise the problem. Let us call the &amp;lsquo;social aspects&amp;rsquo; of a person the &amp;lsquo;sociality&amp;rsquo; of the person; the psychological aspects the &amp;lsquo;personality&amp;rsquo; of the person; and the &amp;lsquo;cultural&amp;rsquo; aspects the &amp;lsquo;culturality&amp;rsquo; of the person. Thus we meet individual human beings and see the differences between ourselves and the other human beings. What kinds of differences do we see?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>On explanations that make people stupid—S.N.Balagangadhara</title>
      <link>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/on-explanations-that-make-people-stupid-s-n-balagangadhara/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/on-explanations-that-make-people-stupid-s-n-balagangadhara/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I do not believe that &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; cultural practice (i.e. a practice that has survived and been transmitted through successive generations) should be explained by attributing beliefs to its practitioners in such a way that the beliefs make the practitioners come out stupid. Why do I say this? There are primarily two reasons: our ignorance and the principle of &amp;lsquo;charity&amp;rsquo;. Let me explain.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(a) &lt;strong&gt;Our ignorance&lt;/strong&gt;. We know very little about how cultures come into being, how they reproduce themselves and how they disappear. Until such a stage, where we are able to discuss each cultural practice (like rain dance, for example) individually, we should avoid making a virtue of our ignorance. One could come up with any number of explanations today to explain a cultural practice like rain dance. Without exception, they would &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; be ad hoc in nature and, as such, the opposite of what a scientific explanation is. Therefore, my criticism of such explanations is to show their ad hoc character and, where possible, identify what makes them ad hoc. The purpose? To move forward in order to develop a science of cultures and cultural differences.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first point is the difficulty involved in specifying what the &amp;ldquo;real meaning of an experience&amp;rdquo; consists of. Asking an insider would not help us here: the insider may or may not know what the real meaning of his/her own experience is or even how to go about putting it in words.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Assuming that the first problem somehow gets solved, the second problem lies in the &lt;em&gt;multiplicities&lt;/em&gt; of such meanings: if people differ on what any particular experience means to them (for instance, what doing Puja to Ganesha means to my brother does not mean the same to my sister), which should we choose and for what reason? This problem is virtually unsolvable, especially when you take the interpretations of the past into consideration as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The general pattern that has come to the fore is that Wendy and her children (including Jeffrey Kripal) &lt;em&gt;systematically&lt;/em&gt; portray the Indian traditions in an unfavorable light, even when compared to how religions like Christianity, Islam and Judaism are portrayed. This claim is made in several articles, independent of whether these religions and the Indian traditions are true or false, whether they are irrational or rational, and so on. The discussion is not about the truth-claims of these religions and traditions but about their depictions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Reductive explanations in social sciences – S.N. Balagangadhara</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/reductive-explanations-in-social-sciences-s-n-balagangadh/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To begin with, there is the feeling that scientific explanations, with their emphasis on rationality and objectivity, are reductive in nature. Wherein lies the &lt;em&gt;root&lt;/em&gt; of this feeling? Let us say that some physical theory describes the motion of a snow flake gently floating down to earth or a rose petal lazily spinning in the air. Or that some branch of human genetics computes the probability of a particular human child being born with absolutely dark eyes or ones that are brilliantly blue. Is either of these two explanations reductive in nature? Not quite: their mathematical calculations tell us very little about the laziness of the petal or about the brilliance of blue eyes, it is true, but it is not their &amp;lsquo;job&amp;rsquo; to do so. If you want to relish descriptions of an autumn evening or a spring morning, you do not open Feynman&amp;rsquo;s Lectures on Physics, do you? You go elsewhere. In other words, the theories in the natural sciences are not &amp;lsquo;reductive&amp;rsquo; in the sense that they do not reduce the &lt;em&gt;beauty&lt;/em&gt; of a particular sunset to the motion of earth around the Sun even if they explain sunrise and sunset.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Someone, let&amp;rsquo;s say her name is Wendy Doniger, comes along and sniggers &amp;lsquo;when you worship the lingam, you worship a phallus&amp;rsquo;. I do not identify Wendy&amp;rsquo;s statement as an &amp;lsquo;ad hoc&amp;rsquo; explanation. I say that it trivializes what I am doing by providing a distorted description of what I do. Here is what I say: &amp;ldquo;I am doing Puja to Shiva.&amp;rdquo; No discussion about &amp;lsquo;Lingam&amp;rsquo; or its many meanings. This is a &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt; way of conducting a discussion. She cannot, therefore, argue that I am giving an &amp;lsquo;ad hoc&amp;rsquo; explanation because I am not giving an &amp;rsquo;explanation&amp;rsquo; of what I am doing but merely describing it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

However, I will eschew making some &lt;em&gt;kinds&lt;/em&gt; of qualifications academics are prone to make, so that any intelligent, but layperson can not only follow the discussion but also &lt;em&gt;evaluate&lt;/em&gt; what is being said.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

For some person, not on this board, there is not a dialog; it is a reading of Wendy, a reading of Balu - how to decide between the two answers, which one represents the truth about Hindus?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Depending on the patience of the visitor, a number of answers are possible including an identification of the nature of the dispute.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let us begin with one of the minimal conditions for inter-cultural (verbal) communication. And that is: people should be able to have conversations with each other. It is legitimate to claim that one does not need to know what a &amp;lsquo;conversation&amp;rsquo; is in order to have a conversation. Therefore, whatever else we may want to say, it would be very difficult to maintain that there is no conversation in other cultures. Equally difficult would it be to hold that some cultures are inferior to others regarding their practice of conversational activity. In other words, our intuitions do not allow us to assert either a factual or a normative claim, which would either deny the existence of conversation in other cultures or suggest that members from some cultures are incompetent conversationalists.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;1.1. The inherent logic of such an enterprise forces one, as it were, to build &lt;em&gt;alternate&lt;/em&gt; theories to the existing, &amp;lsquo;western&amp;rsquo; theories. Instead of explaining this statement in the abstract, let me take a concrete example to illustrate what I mean.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1.2. In the University of Chicago, there is a certain Richard Shweder. He practices &amp;lsquo;Cultural Psychology&amp;rsquo;, and is (was?) professor of &amp;lsquo;Human Development&amp;rsquo;. He is rather well-known for his &amp;lsquo;cross-cultural&amp;rsquo; studies: he and his students have published many works comparing psychological developments across the two cultures that India and America are. (In fact, he received a medal from the American Association of the Advancement of Science, if I remember properly, for one of his articles: &amp;lsquo;Does the concept of the Person vary cross-culturally?&amp;rsquo; This was a study about the concept of &amp;lsquo;self&amp;rsquo; in the USA and Orissa, India.) A few years ago, he published a study on the nature of &lt;em&gt;moral development&lt;/em&gt; and the growth of moral awareness cross-culturally: again, India and the USA were the two compared cultures.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I would like you to consider the following four &lt;em&gt;kinds&lt;/em&gt; of answers, each pitched at a different level of generality and at a different level of description. One could provide more, but these four should be enough to give a &lt;em&gt;taste&lt;/em&gt; of the kind of wine you might care to drink.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Suppose that one were to ask you: how to go about doing &amp;lsquo;science&amp;rsquo; (in general) or, say, doing &amp;lsquo;physics&amp;rsquo;? What kind of an answer could you possibly give? If you do not want to be unkind, you will probably give answers that will not be satisfying to the questioner. Like what? May be you will say: one needs to read, think about a problem, provide a solution and critically evaluate the hypothetical answer and so on. If the questioner presses his point and asks: yes, but &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; does one go about doing any of these, what will your answer be? The only reasonable answer you can give him is to point him in the direction of a &lt;em&gt;model&lt;/em&gt;: go, read that book on physics, you will perhaps say, and then you have an idea of what I am talking about.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I want to raise three issues: (a) how to analyze what Rajiv portrays about Wendy and her children in the field of religious studies; (b) depending on that, what an adequate response consists of. Before we do either (this is one of the things I have discovered through my own research during the last two decades), we need to be clear about (c) how we &lt;em&gt;should not&lt;/em&gt; analyze this situation. Given that all three (in their general form) have been my obsessions, I have been reflecting on them deeply, seriously and systematically for some time now. I would like to share some of the results of this reflection. In the first part, I will take a (rather slow) run up to tackling the third issue first. And even here, I look at RISA &lt;em&gt;lila&lt;/em&gt; as an exemplification of a more general issue or as an expression of a much broader tendency.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
