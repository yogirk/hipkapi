      <p>I
I think that the multiple routes that exist in the Indian culture and those that individuals follow are on par with each other. From within any one of these, the other routes appear as moments. However, this does not privilege any one route above the other.
If one were to suggest, say, that the Puranic stories are simplifications of the Upanishadic insights then one has to endorse a claim of the following sort.  What makes some sets of sentences into a simplification of other sets of sentences is that the former leaves out nuances, qualifications, conditionalities, and so on of the latter. That is to say, the simplification is less true (or more conditionally true) than the complex version. In this way we would get a hierarchy of statements (from complex to the simple), where each succeeding simplification is less true than the predecessor. Only the statement at the apex of such a pyramid would be the truest of the lot. Then, we would have but one set of true statements. Relative to this set, all other statements would be false.
In such a case, there would be no plurality of traditions. There would be but one &rsquo;true&rsquo; path; all other paths would not lead us to the same goal as the true one does. Not only that. Under such a construction, enlightenment would not be something that all human beings could strive for and achieve; only &lsquo;some&rsquo; (those who are able to understand the Upanishadic claims) could do so. Consequently, one has to add a rider: only some people (endowed only in one particular way) could find happiness (eudaimonia, enlightenment).
The strength of the Indian traditions lies, amongst other things, in their unconditional claim: all human beings can find happiness. The differences between human beings (no matter whether this difference is biological, sociological, psychological in nature) matter only when it comes to the choice of the path best suited for them. If this statement is true, then the Puranic stories cannot be, under any interpretation of the word, simplifications of more complex claims.
II
I cannot quite figure out whether we are talking about different things or expressing differing points of view or simply using different words. I am talking about two contrast sets: &lsquo;simplification&rsquo; and &lsquo;complexity&rsquo;, whereas you seem to talk about &lsquo;simplicity&rsquo; and &lsquo;complication&rsquo; (also at times using &lsquo;complex&rsquo; as a synonym for &lsquo;complicated&rsquo;). You are right that simplification and complexity apply to descriptions; that is why I spoke of both of them in terms of &lsquo;sets of sentences&rsquo; (in some language or another). Let me explain what I mean.
If there is a &lsquo;simple&rsquo; and a &lsquo;complicated&rsquo; explanation available to me, and they are alternatives in the sense that they do more or less the same job in explaining what needs to be explained, then I would prefer a simple to a complicated explanation. Here, the difference between these two explanations resides in the fact that the complicated explanation uses more concepts than the simple one does but both do the same job. (Let us leave aside why I choose a simple explanation; the reasons have to do with my philosophical preferences.)
In the case of a &lsquo;simplified&rsquo; and a &lsquo;complex&rsquo; explanation, the situation is different. The simplified set of statements (mostly) makes use of non-technical vocabulary to get across the point of a complex explanation. The simplification leaves aside qualifications, presuppositions, conditions, etc. which are all required for the explanation to really explain some phenomenon or another. (Elegantly written popularizing books on physics, biology, chemistry, etc. belong to the class of simplifications of complex explanations.) So, all a layperson like me needs is a book that simplifies the complex explanations of the physicists about blackholes, of the geneticists about gene-sequencing, etc. in order for me to get some idea of what these physicists and geneticists are doing. Unlike a text-book in physics or in genetics, these popularizing books that simplify complex ideas DO NOT enable me to do physics or genetics. Instead, they make use of the rich resources of a natural language (similes, metaphors, analogies, examples, jokes, etc.) to get an idea approximately across to someone like me who lacks the technical expertise in the area or domain under consideration.
Now comes the question of the relationship between the Upanishadic statements and Puranic stories. If, as you seem to suggest now and then in your post to me, it is the case that Puranic stories tell me &ldquo;in simple terms&rdquo; something that the Upanishads make &ldquo;complicated&rdquo; (or render the same in &lsquo;abstruse&rsquo; terms, as you put it), then my choice is clear: go for the Puranic stories all the way.  Under this construal, Puranic stories are alternatives to the Upanishadic claims. I do not believe this to be the case.
Do the puranic stories simplify the complex claims of the Upanishads? If they did, analogous to what I said above, the puranic stories could not help me attain enlightenment, much the same way a popularizing book on modern day physics does not enable me to do research in physics today. Then, the only way I can do physics is by learning physics; similarly the only way to attain enlightenment would be to understand the Upanishads. I do not buy this either. That is why I do not think that Puranic stories are simplifications of the Upanishads.
III
Question: The relationship between the Puranas and the Upanishads with regards to simplification need not necessarily be of the type Popular Science Books : Physics Text Books. It could be of the type Undergraduate Physics Text Books : Graduate Physics Text Books. They could be dealing with same subject, but the coverage, depth, and rigour could be different. But both will help one learn Physics and do Physics.
A good point, even though it is not entirely clear to me what that point does to my argument. Therefore, let me think aloud and consider two ways in which undergraduate textbooks in physics help you to do physics.
Let us suppose you learn Snell&rsquo;s law of refraction, Maxwell&rsquo;s law of electro-magnetism and, say, an introductory chapter on Nuclear physics. Let us say that you also do some laboratory experiments on the first two. No doubt, you are learning to do physics now. Do they help you do research on Nuclear physics immediately  thereafter? Today, their function is entirely different: they are propaedeutics, courses that provide you with an introduction to the subject. They help you acquire the necessary apparatus to learn more and go deeper into the subject. They are not simplifications of complex explanations but ones that provide you with some rudimentary notions, using which you can learn other concepts. When you learn about the atomic value of an element in Chemistry, this piece of knowledge does not simplify. You merely learn that elements have atomic values and you might also learn something about what that word means. You will come across the idea of electrons, their orbits and nucleus. You are taught that electrons can be excited but you also learn that it has something to do with energy. In other words, the undergraduate texts prepare you for research; you do as laboratory experiments what research was to your predecessors. In this sense, because the frontier of knowledge keeps moving, the nature and kind of preparation required to do research also keeps shifting.
Do the Puranic stories have a similar propaedutic function with respect to the Upanishads? If they do, then you are suggesting something like the following: enlightenment consists of vertical hierarchy of knowledge elements and that one can become enlightened if and only if one has gone through the phase of undergraduation. If you want to argue this, then you are committed to saying that there is only one route to enlightenment. The other paths train you to tread the Upanishadic path. &lsquo;All routes lead to Jnana&rsquo; and only though that can you achieve enlightenment.
Three things require noting in this regard. One is that this is a description that those who follow this path provide with regard to other paths: all other paths are moments in one&rsquo;s own path. While this could be true of one&rsquo;s own development, it overlooks the fact that disciples of the other paths say exactly the same thing with respect to their own path. The second thing is that it makes enlightenment &lsquo;conditional&rsquo; upon possessing some specific ability or another. In the same way not every undergraduate student in physics can go on to do research in physics, it suggests that only some can attain enlightenment. The third thing is that such a position cannot account for the rivalry between the different Indian traditions: their rivalry is not at the level of a competition between different undergraduate texts, namely, which of the paths brings you to the path of &lsquo;jnana&rsquo; quicker and better. Instead, they claim that they all help you in achieving enlightenment and that &lsquo;jnana&rsquo; itself is but one of the paths to enlightenment.
Let me now consider the following question: is there any way of deciding which kind of research in physics is better? That is to say, is research in Plasma physics better than research in solid state physics, or doing research in astrophysics? The only way of making sense of this question is to relativize it to an individual&rsquo;s concern of wanting to know the area in which s/he should do research: In which area do I want to do research and why?
The multiple paths to human happiness is something analogous to the above situation, as I see the issue. Being happy or enlightened (as you know, I use these two words as synonyms) is like doing research in physics. It is not an &rsquo;end state&rsquo;; it is a goal only in the sense of &lsquo;doing research in physics&rsquo; can be our goal. Whether you do research in plasma physics or solid state physics, you are doing research in physics; in the same way, Upanishads and puranas help you find happiness. There is no hierarchy of any sort between them.
IV
I intended to speak of &ldquo;two ways in which undergraduate textbooks in physics help you to do physics&rdquo; but ended up writing only about one way. Here is the second of the two ways I wanted to consider.
Assume, for a moment, that both Upanishads and Puranas are propaedeutics to &ldquo;doing research&rdquo;, i.e., to be happy. Could we then compare them and say which one of them is better? Though I cannot answer this question on the basis of my experience, I think even the enlightened would face the following issue, which I have often faced in my career.
When you have acquired the competence in some domain and are doing further research, people often ask you for a &ldquo;good text book&rdquo;. I find this an extremely difficult question to answer. The reason is this: I find a text book a &lsquo;good one&rsquo;, if it gives me (the experienced researcher) a very good overview of my field of research, beginning with (what I consider) rudimentary ideas. However, I have discovered (through my own experience) that what is a &lsquo;good text book&rsquo; to me is more often than not a &lsquo;very bad text book&rsquo;, if you look at it from a pedagogical point of view. One who begins learning a new field requires another kind of introduction than what I would consider a &lsquo;good introduction&rsquo;. As an experienced researcher, I find a systematic overview of my domain a &lsquo;good introduction&rsquo;; those who begin to learn a new domain require a good introduction to learn and not a &lsquo;systematic overview&rsquo;. Our requirements are different. That is also the reason why writing a &lsquo;good text book&rsquo; (or being a teacher) is not something every good researcher can do. Only some can be good teachers; only a few can write good text books.
In this sense, I believe that even the enlightened would face analogous problems. Some might find some or another Upanishad a &lsquo;good introduction&rsquo;; some find that just one of the Mahavakyas is enough; yet others find the puranic stories sublime. The only one who can decide about it is the student. What helps him/her to find happiness is the thing that works for that person. More, one cannot say.
V
You ask what I mean by this: Three things require noting in this regard. One is that this is a description that those who follow this path provide with regard to other paths: all other paths are moments in one&rsquo;s own path. While this could be true of one&rsquo;s own development, it overlooks the fact that disciples of the other paths say exactly the same thing with respect to their own path.&quot;
What I mean: Bhakti, for instance, claims that it is the best path to enlightenment because both the &lsquo;Karma&rsquo; and the &lsquo;jnana&rsquo; path are the subordinate moments of Bhakti. (I speak about this more in detail in my “How to speak for the Indian traditions&quot; article.) All I want to suggest is that teach path (karmic, Jnana, Bhakti, yogic, Tantric, meditative, etc) is special to the practitioner and S/he sees in it the presence of all other paths. We need to account for this stance
Why I say this in the context of the discussion: let us, for the time being, associate puranic stories with the practice of puja, and consider this too as a path to enlightenment. Were we to say that one does not achieve enlightenment through this manner and claim that only &lsquo;jnana&rsquo; leads one to enlightenment, then we cannot account for the claim (that many in our traditions make) that illiterate people, with their simple practice of doing a daily puja to some vigraha or another (or even to trees), also achieve enlightenment. In our accounts of and attempts at understanding enlightenment, we need to account for these claims. (We could account for them by saying they are false; but I take them seriously.)
You ask: &ldquo;But what&rsquo;s wrong with believing that only some can attain enlightenment? No-one&rsquo;s claiming that some people are being forcibly shut out. Technically speaking, enlightenment is open to all. But to me your view is analogous to saying that everyone can be an opera singer or a fabulous dancer.&rdquo;
One&rsquo;s ability to become an opera singer or a fabulous dancer is conditional: it depends on one&rsquo;s biological inheritance and one&rsquo;s aptitude, among other things. It also depends on one&rsquo;s skill and practice; one&rsquo;s teachers and so on. Human happiness, according to how I understand the Indian traditions, is accessible to all. Every one of us can be happy. Not merely &rsquo;technically&rsquo;, as you put it, but also in reality. The fact, however, that all of us are not happy has led the Indian traditions to investigate things that stand in the way of human happiness. It has also made them discover various means and modalities to overcome these impediments. All human beings, if they seek happiness, can really become happy. The possibility of achieving this goal does not depend on  some kind of &lsquo;moral luck&rsquo;, the way being an opera singer or a fabulous dancer does. &ldquo;Seek, and ye shall find&rdquo;, our traditions seem to say. (I speak about these things more in detail in the talk I gave at the Catholic University of Louvain.) Finding happiness is not a question of accident or luck; it is the guaranteed result of a search.
Is Enlightenment different from happiness? Well, here one chooses one&rsquo;s own terminology, I guess. The happiness that I speak about is what Aristotle called &lsquo;Eudaimonia&rsquo;: as that which if a person has, s/he will never lose. There might be more to enlightenment than happiness, as defined above. However, I do believe that enlightenment is the only &lsquo;property&rsquo; which, if you once have it, you will never lose. No other human quality has this nature.</p>

This <strong>book</strong>  tries to answer a question that is also its title. This book shares some of the results of 40 years of research in the Research Programme Comparative Science of Cultures. It plots the outlines of the differences that distinguish one culture from another, Indian and western in our case. The narrative does not track differences between nations, societies or religions but investigates domains like experience, sense of the past and constructions of the self to sketch a possible answer to the question. The book straddles the fields of social sciences and humanities to tackle issues of knowledge about culture and exhibits the relevance of these areas of enquiry to us all. It suggests an alternative to the ruling orthodoxies that constitute ‘identity politics’ today while showing that this label hides more content than even what their best proponents imagine.
<strong>Written in a non-academic language and an accessible style</strong>, the book addresses an intelligent but lay public. Consequently, it contains neither many citations nor any references. However, what it conveys is based on a scientific research programme, whose results are published in scientific journals and research monographs. It also formulates interesting hypotheses currently under investigation.
Today the question <em>What does it mean to be ‘Indian’?</em> faces difficulty. Is it a motto like ‘E Pluribus Unum’ or ‘satyameva jayate’? Is it a ‘colourful’ and ‘beautiful’ culture where people wear bindis, deck themselves in Kanchipuram Silk and do puja? Is it a question of national borders and territories? Or is it an institutional question: about educational institutions, courts of law, a huge parliament or even being the world’s ‘largest’ democracy? Do we belong to a culture of oppression, exploitation and conflict or do we aspire to draw the divine nectar by churning the ocean? Is there something ‘Indian’ about our culture that goes beyond the differences between Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs or Jains? What does it <em>überhaupt</em> mean to belong to Indian culture?
<strong>Why ask this question today?</strong> Do we not know the answers? After all, as we know, a lot is written about India, her culture, her past, her society, the psychology and sociology of individuals and their groups. Why is that not enough to answer the query about what it means to be ‘Indian’?
It is because what we have learnt about ourselves so far is either false or very fragmentary. Whether one claims that India is a class society or a caste society or a combination of both, one is not saying much. Such a claim merely tells us that India too has a society and that it either fully or partially mirrors other societies and people one way or another. Our question is not whether we are also human beings, whether we also have a social and cultural life, but <em>what kind of people we are, where we are coming from and where should we head as a society, as a culture and as individuals</em>. Thus, we ask: what does it mean to be ‘Indian’?
In answering this question, this book <strong>transcends the distinction between ‘the right’ and ‘the left’ by looking deeper into ideas of human beings, society, culture, experience, past</strong> and other related clusters. One such element is the colonial past of India which is of relevance not merely to the colonised but to the coloniser as well. It is through the British that India is drawn into western culture, transforming both herself and the West in the process. In outlining its contours, the book shows why its question is relevant not just to the citizens of a country or to members of a culture but to all of us who consider ourselves human beings.
Indian intellectuals have vacillated between virtue-signalling and moral indignation; they have completely given up all intellectual questions and responsibilities. This has resulted in a large, <strong>intelligent and educated populace that is hungry for insights that make sense of their world</strong>. This group, in India (and abroad), is fed up with being told that they ought to be ashamed of being Indian, of belonging to the &rsquo;third world&rsquo; and are no longer convinced that they ought to become as western as quickly as possible. Their numbers are growing by the day. This group ranges from the Millennials entering their thirties to the young retirees entering their sixties. This is the first generation of the middle class, which emerged in the 80s and 90s. These Millennials who grew up believing themselves to be ‘global citizens’ are now confronted with the inadequacy of the stories they have. <em><strong>‘What does it mean to be an Indian, in the 21st century?’</strong></em> is a question they are confronting as an actuality with real-world implications. This is a question raised at the level of culture and can only be answered at that level. Neither nationalism nor identity-politics are satisfactory.
This book is sui generis and fills a lacuna that few have identified, let alone addressed. If Asian culture is not simply a slightly inferior, slightly idiosyncratic variant of European culture, as we have been told for a very long time, what else is it? Hence, the corollary question: What does it mean to be an Indian? The author can ask and answer this question because he has theorised on a larger question in his four decades of research: <strong>What makes a difference, any difference, into a cultural difference and not a social, psychological or biological difference?</strong> As of today, there is no competition. There are books that slice the question in old and familiar ways: religion, politics, spirituality, sociology etc. These familiar stories in their various permutations and combinations have not only grown stale but are demonstrably useless.</p>

    <div class="post-excerpt">
      <p>I will take up some of the general points, which I think are relevant to the Indian American community at large. First, let me say I am impressed by the dynamism present in this community. In spite of the demands of daily life, Indian Americans find the time and energy to engage in intellectual debates about the nature of their traditions. In spite of the discrimination and &ldquo;religion oppression&rdquo; [1] faced by them, there is a general sense of optimism about the future of these traditions.
It is important that this dynamism remain a positive force. Some Indian Americans have adopted the name-calling that we find among certain American academics. Whereas the latter call anyone who dares say a few positive words about the Indian traditions &ldquo;a Hindutva sycophant,&rdquo; the former trend to label any western intellectual who dares question the dominant representations of the Indian traditions as a &ldquo;Witzellian.&rdquo; The legitimate discontent about the academic representation of the Indian traditions should not lead us to a general anti-intellectual stance. Anti-intellectualism knows only one endpoint: the <em>Taliban</em>. Now, if there is one community aware of the duty to avoid that society moves towards that point, it is the Indian American community. Since intellectuals share this sense of duty, our study of the Indian traditions should show how they can contribute to making American society a more tolerant, open-minded and happier society.
As Chitra Raman affirms, the Indian traditions have been conceptualized in an extremely impoverished manner during the last few centuries. It is the hypothesis of our research group that this is the case because they have been viewed <em>through a secularized biblical framework</em>. [2] The same framework also puts conceptual limitations on the structure of American pluralism. This is not an assessment about the origins of this form of pluralism or a judgment about its biased nature, but rather a <em>cognitive</em> analysis of its contemporary structure. Such an analysis cannot be challenged by a moralizing judgement (e.g., that it justifies discrimination). The only way to really challenge my hypothesis is to develop another hypothesis about the structure of American pluralism. Naturally, its purpose is to develop new ways of solving the problems of pluralism in the U.S. To do so, one should indeed strive to bring American pluralism beyond its biblical straitjacket in the near future. Perhaps, no group is as qualified to do so as the Indian Americans.
But before they can take up this task, they should understand the depth of the predicament. Even more so, they have to become aware that they have appropriated the secularized Christian conception of the Indian traditions as a self-description. The predicament we face is <em>cognitive</em> in nature: the currently dominant conception of the Indian traditions makes sense only against the background of the biblical framework. It is cognitive in the sense that the way we currently think and talk about “Hinduism” leads to a distortion of the very nature of the Indian traditions. This dominant conception of “Hinduism” does not describe these traditions themselves, but rather <em>how they appear through western and Christian lenses</em>. Yet many Indians and Indian Americans talk as though this conception makes eminent sense to them.
Chitra Raman develops a nice analogy: it is like using the grammar of one language to understand another. One may adopt the words of the second language, but when one embeds them in the grammatical structure of the first language, one ends up with virtual gibberish. The analogy can be taken further: today, it is as though the native speakers of the second language have accepted the grammatical structure of the first language as the only correct one and they try to speak their own language in this way. This is the nature of our predicament: many Indians and Indian Americans have adopted the conceptual framework of Christianity to talk about their own traditions. They assume the Indian traditions are a belief system or religion with its own doctrines, commandments and rules. As I will try to show, this makes about as much sense as using the grammatical structure of one language to speak another completely different language.
To avoid any misunderstanding, let it be clear that the denial that the Indian traditions are of the same nature as biblical religion does not involve any value judgement. They also have a highly-developed structure, but this is so different from Judaism, Christianity and Islam that it is impossible to maintain that the Indian traditions and the latter three are instances of the same kind. In fact, once we appreciate how different the Indian traditions are from these religions, we will rediscover how rich and valuable they really are. To return to the language analogy: if we used the grammatical structure of one language to speak another, we would not be able to understand this second language and would also ignore its rich contributions to literature, philosophy and poetry. It is only when we rediscover the structure of this second language that its treasures become available to us. Similarly, when we rediscover the nature of the Indian traditions and rescue them from being transformed into just another religion, we will be able to show how they have contributed to the pursuit of knowledge at a level undreamt of.
<em><strong>The Priest and the Swami</strong></em>
In <em>Facing the Challenge of American Pluralism</em>, I argued that the Indian traditions revolve around the exploring and examining of one’s experience so as to attain perfect happiness. What does this mean? How is it different from what religions like Christianity and Islam do? As an entry point, take a Hindu swamiji and a Christian priest. The priest says “God is a Trinity.” The swamiji says “<em>Tat Tvam Asi</em>.” What is the difference between the two?
First the priest. The sentence “God is a Trinity” is a doctrine to him; it is a proposition about the world, which he takes to be absolutely true. Because it is a doctrine, the sentence is embedded in an elaborate theological system. It is related to other sentences that explain its true meaning: theological doctrines about Jesus being the Son of God and the Father, the Son and the Spirit being one substance, but three persons. Arguments have been developed to establish the truth of the Trinitarian doctrine. Its correct formulation was discussed and fixed at the First Council of Nicea in 325 AD. The result is the Nicene Creed: a set of beliefs that are held to reflect religious truth by most Christian denominations. As a Christian believer, when the priest says “God is a Trinity,” one is expected to accept this as a true belief, a doctrine embedded in a belief system that claims the one and only religious truth. As an orthodox Christian today, one should understand this doctrine, proclaim its truth and be able to defend it against its detractors. One should not question its truth and meaning. These have been fixed for good.
Now the swamiji. When he states “<em>Tat Tvam Asi</em>,<em>”</em> does he expect all Hindus to accept this sentence as a true doctrine? Does he want them to take this as a true belief, whose truth they should proclaim and defend against the “false beliefs” of other religions? Does he expect them to memorize the sentence and its related doctrines and arguments, and repeat them until eternity? No, he does not. When the swamiji teaches, he takes into account the different levels and experiences of his audience. He will explain “<em>Tat Tvam Asi</em>” in different ways according to the different experiential levels of individuals. The sentence does not have one fixed true meaning, precisely because it functions as an instruction for exploring one’s own experience. It suggests that the distinction between I and not-I is a temporary figment that results from interpreting our experience in a particular way. If we examine this experience at a deeper level, we will slowly discover that there is no such distinction there. The swamiji’s explanation of the sentence will make sense to us, according to where we are on the path towards this discovery.
Hence, neither the speech of the <em>swamiji</em> nor the texts of the Indian traditions can be understood as belief systems or doctrines, which have a fixed meaning and claim to reflect the one religious truth. They are “heuristics” that function as instructions for action to explore our own experience. To attain the insights embodied in these sentences, one has to examine them from all sides, relate them to one’s experience and question their truth repeatedly. Only in this way can they help us become better and happier human beings. The claim of the Indian traditions is not that we should accept them as true doctrines or that such acceptance is a precondition for attaining salvation. They do not postpone perfect happiness until after death. Neither do they claim that there is only one true path to attain this state. Rather, they claim that all human beings can attain perfect happiness here on earth and that there are countless ways to achieve this goal.
Those who conceptualize the Indian traditions as “belief systems,” “doctrines” or “religion” take away the unique nature of these traditions. They make the rich storehouse of experiential knowledge embodied by these traditions inaccessible and do so by transforming them into a belief system, the Hindu equivalent of Christianity or Islam. Let it be clear that the Indian traditions are neither belief systems nor religions. They are far more fascinating than that. I refer you to the piece by my teacher S. N. Balagangadhara (soon to be published on the India Forum website) to get a glimpse of how rich these traditions are. Here, just note that it is <em>precisely the way in which the Indian traditions are different from belief systems, which makes them into extremely important but uncharted contributions to the human pursuit of knowledge</em>.
<em><strong>Transforming the Swami into a Priest</strong></em>
But what happens when we reduce the Indian traditions into a Hindu “religion,” “world view” or “belief system”? What are the consequences of transforming the swamiji into a priest? Why is this development so harmful?</p>

      <p><strong>1</strong>. In this talk, I would like to focus on the two attitudes that I have towards your project. It is not that I have ambiguous feelings; no, I have two distinct feelings. On the one hand, I am convinced that you will not reach your goal because such a goal is unreachable. Not only that. Your goal is undesirable and best abandoned. On the other hand, if you strive with integrity, clarity and passion to reach your goal, in the process, you will achieve results that are desirable, necessary and important. So, I would like to support and encourage your project. On the one hand, I believe that I can develop a few impossibility arguments that will show why you best abandon your project; on the other hand, I have given no thought to developing such a set of arguments because I want you to work further towards your goal so that you produce the results that we, as humankind, need. This might suggest that I am ambiguous toward your project, but, as I said, I am not. To explain thus attitude better, let me use an illustration from the history of philosophy (albeit in a slightly caricatured form),</p>

<p>Edward Said is dead. Last Wednesday he lost his battle with cancer. The influence of this Palestinian writer in all areas of the social sciences of the last quarter century is immense. Many will remember him from Delhi to Dar Es Salaam, from Paris to Chicago; many will also write in memoriams.</p>

      <p>There are multiple kinds of interpretation. For instance, there is interpretation of symbols in a domain like Physics: μ (in elementary optics) is &ldquo;interpreted&rdquo; as the refraction index of a substance. We use a more or less analogous notion of &ldquo;interpretation&rdquo; in Chemistry, Mathematics and so on. In logic, we speak of &ldquo;interpretation of variables&rdquo; like <em>p</em>, <em>q</em>, etc. Here, it means that the letters stand-in for arbitrary sentences with truth-values.</p>

      <p>The western intellectual tradition has bemoaned the fact that the Indians never indulged in history-writing (or historiography). In this tradition, there is an obsessive need for collecting &ldquo;facts&rdquo; about the past. This is partly the result of how Judaism, Christianity and Islam (the three Semitic religions) look at themselves and their own past: everything they claim about their past (the Flood, the temple of Solomon, the coming of Christ, etc.) should not only be true but proven so beyond all doubt. They have to be true (in the sense that their recounting of the past should also be confirmed by research) because these religions live or die accordingly as whether it is also true what they say effectively happened on earth. These facts (like the existence of, say, the Temple of Solomon in the Israel of today and the Judea of yesterday or the existence of Jesus of Nazareth), in their turn, prove the truth about Moses and his tablet and the truth of the promise of God to the children of Israel. If the recounting of their past turns out to be false (like, say, the absence of any of the above two) would destroy their existence: if there was never a historical Jesus of Nazareth, Christianity would collapse like a house of cards. (In fact, Julian the Apostate, the nephew of the Emperor Constantine, set out to rebuild the Temple of Solomon at its original site precisely in order to do this. His early death, viewed both by the Jews and the Christians as an act of God, put an end to this project.)</p>

      <p>Two caveats. One: the commentary is very, very short. To write down all the things I want to say about this citation requires a long paper and not a brief mail. Two: I have not checked either the citation or the reference (Brihadaranyaka upanishad - I.iv.10). I assume that both are accurate.</p>

<p>Question: “Certainly that Brahman == self-awareness == Atman is also a matter of direct experience, not of intellectual reasoning?”</p>
<p>Let me first begin with reason and then drift towards experience.</p>
<p>Suppose, as an expansion of the sentence that ‘Atman is Brahman’, it is said: “Atman and Brahman are identical to each other”. What kind of sense does it make and how do we explain that sense? Let us note that this sentence makes linguistic sense. Therefore, the question is, how do you parse this sentence to bring out that sense?</p>

      <p>Some Swamiji claims: “One cannot experience the Atman[, the Atman] is the witness, it is what experiences.”</p>
<p>Obviously, this is a very rough and approximate formulation. This statement is both wrong and right in different ways. (a) In the very early days, when I began to develop my meditation exercise, I ‘sensed’ the vague presence of an observer (somewhere present in the background of my experiential world). Or, you could say, I vaguely sensed that I was being ‘seen’ or that my meditative performance was being performed for an ‘outside’ observer. Perhaps, it would also be accurate to say that I sensed its vague presence outside my meditative world, but touching upon its edges. Later, when I was trying to help other people meditate, I discovered that some sensed this presence too and yet others had to ‘let go’ in order to sense this presence. I am guessing that this is the idea of Atman as a ‘witness’. Some were fearful and afraid of this presence as well. If you say that to sense the vague presence is to experience that presence, the Swamiji is wrong. If you see this vague sensing of a presence (or sensing the vague presence of something) as not experiencing, the Swamij would be right. (b) Does the Atman experience? If you keep the word ‘experience’ sufficiently broad (or nebulous), yes, that is true. Self-awareness is obviously ‘aware’ (working purely at a linguistic level); self-consciousness is obviously ‘conscious’ (I say this in my note as well to understand the access). In this sense, yes, the Swamiji is right. However, the Swamiji is wrong if we claim, which we have to, that experience (as we know it today) requires some kind of bodily constraint (i.e. the presence of an apparatus to experience). We have to say here that self-consciousness is not tantamount to ‘experience’. Then the question opens up: if self-consciousness is not ‘experience’ what else is it? I have no answer except to say that it is ‘self-consciousness’, period. It is also further true, on both accounts, that <strong>sentience does not experience self-consciousness but merely accesses it.</strong> In that case, the next problem: what does this access generate? Some or another kind of experience or not? If we cannot provide some kind of a satisfactory answer, the word ‘access’ is an occult word and does no work. (These are not the only set of problems, but it does indicate why understanding ‘enlightenment’ is far, far more difficult than achieving that state.)</p>

      <p>You say that you experienced Shakti as an emanation of a force that is overpowering and palpable; you also say that you felt the ‘presence’ of Shakti strongly. These two sentences make one think that you felt the presence of the force. In that case, there are only two routes open to us: (a) either reject that we have knowledge of the world which forbids linguistic utterances from infusing material objects with ‘life’ forces that can have causal impact in the world; (b) or ‘downgrade’ science as knowledge of the world by allowing ‘spiritual’ (or supra-mundane) worlds to causally interact with the ‘physical’ world. Your own process of thinking about this experience is rigidly hemmed in by these alternatives. Neither, I think, is what you are seeking. If you are, you cannot and will not find what you seek, even if it is to merely figure out your experience.</p>

      <p>Consider the fact that the Indian ‘gods’ are portrayed in at least two ways. First, there is their portrayal with four arms (say) and there is their portrayal in completely human forms. Krishna has four arms (with Shankha, Chakra, Gada and Padma or one hand with a blessing palm or downward indicating a mudra of some kind) and he also has a fully human form. The balakrishna’s I have seen give him only two arms. So do many images of Krishna: he has only two arms. However, apart from other symbols (flute, peacock feather, etc), his colour is almost invariant. Ganesha is even more interesting: there are balaganesha’s crawling with two arms and with four arms. There are images of a four-armed Ganesha sitting on the lap of a two-armed Shiva (with and without his third eye but holding a trishula). In any case, he has the elephant head. Most Durga’s have multiple arms, a few frightening heads but there are also those with human form and pretty faces. Same applies to Parvati, Laxmi and Saraswati. Except, of course, they invariably have pretty faces. They too have characteristic traits: seated on Padma, carrying a Veena, or next to Shiva or Ganesha or sitting on top of a mountain surrounded by snowy peaks. There are also others where she is on a peetha or is very well dressed and adorned with ornaments. In short, some or another trait is mostly present that identifies which ‘goddess’ or ‘god’ s/he is. The rest, obviously, is left free. Of course, there are also images that can only be identified, if so identified by local stories, the pujari’s at the temples and so on. If these are our ‘popular gods’, the less-known (say the village ‘goddesses’) are even more problematic. Many village ‘goddesses’ look similarly vague and are almost but not quite amorphous.</p>

      <p><strong>Question</strong>: I have some problems understanding <em>apara, para, existence, and presence</em>. Apara exists, but is not present; para is present but does not exist. Are you saying that what is present does not exist, what exists is not present? If so, how can you reconcile with our common sense notion that what exists is present?  Even though presence doesn’t imply existence, we can’t say that existence imply non-presence. So, this is an issue of definitional equivalence: para = presence; apara = existence.</p>

      <p>It would be a good thing to narrow-in on the ‘spookiness’ of the accessing &lsquo;Real&rsquo;. However, because there is a very great danger that ‘access’ can be conceptualised as an access to a ‘supra-mundane’ or a ‘spiritual’ world, or to a world that is not accessible to ‘sciences’  but can be ‘spiritually’ accessed, etc. a few extra words are required. Therefore, an attempt that might reduce one possible kind of spookiness that you might be referring to.</p>
