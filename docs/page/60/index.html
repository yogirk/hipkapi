      <p>In a way, and in some sense, I do agree with you that one&rsquo;s acquaintance with a culture is useful in writing about that culture. It is not sufficient, of course (think of the nonsense written by most anthropologists during the last 100 years on other cultures); nor are there any compelling reasons to believe that it is a sine qua non to understanding cultures. However, I am not challenging the claim that the context of the person might be relevant to producing knowledge.</p>

      <p>Is the model of games useful in understanding evolution of some aspect of society? If you use &lsquo;games&rsquo; in a very, very general sense (viz. there are players, strategies, end-results, and such like), then it might. There is a flourishing branch of mathematics called &lsquo;Game theory&rsquo; that has been used to study many things in nature and society: from the evolution of rules and norms to seeing evolution itself in Game-theoretic terms. I need to warn you that its notion of games is a technical one and involves two or more &lsquo;players&rsquo;, who follow certain strategies for &lsquo;winning&rsquo; to which a certain pay-off is coupled. While it has uncovered certain interesting dilemmas in societies, I do not find it as fruitful as its practitioners claim.</p>

      <p>I do not see why I have to study the history of the last 4000 years to understand modern India. To the extent past becomes relevant (my research into some particular question will tell me whether the past is relevant, if so which part of the past is relevant, and how far I need to go in understanding the issue I want to understand), only to that extent do I need to study the past. The general statement &lsquo;we are what we are because of the past&rsquo; is true. But this is also a general statement. How far into my &lsquo;past&rsquo; do you need to go in order to understand my present? That depends on which part of the present you want to understand and what this &lsquo;understanding&rsquo; means in the context of your research. The same applies to a study of cultures and societies.</p>

      <p>About the possibility that I was already &lsquo;westernized&rsquo; by the time I became a teenager. Even this question is wrongly posed. I am not claiming that there is some &lsquo;authentic&rsquo; Indian culture, which lives somewhere or lived some when in India. Such a culture, even if it exists or existed, does not concern me. I am interested in the Indian culture as it <em>exists</em> today: including the aftermath of the Islamic and the British colonization. I am child of <em>this</em> culture, and this is the one I am trying to understand. The Indian &lsquo;Diaspora&rsquo; in the US is <em>as much</em> Indian as some peasant living somewhere in a far-off village in India; they both belong to the Indian culture. Neither this peasant nor the Indians in the US is &lsquo;more Indian&rsquo; than the other. My problem is not: who is the &lsquo;authentic&rsquo; Indian or what is the &lsquo;authentic&rsquo; Indian culture? My question is about the 21st century India, and its present culture, which has absorbed many things, adapted many things from other cultures in many different ways. It is this set of Indian traditions that interests me. Was I &lsquo;westernized&rsquo; by the time I was a teenager? Who knows, or even who cares? What would it mean to say that I was &lsquo;authentically&rsquo; Indian or that I was &lsquo;quasi-westernized&rsquo;? Surely, the issue is not about some kind of &lsquo;purity&rsquo; here. What else is it? Consequently, when I speak of my past, I speak of the past of those who were brought up like me. If we were all partly &lsquo;westernized&rsquo;, then the culture I am talking about is this &lsquo;partly westernized&rsquo; Indian culture. An age long gone by, if it ever existed, does not give me sleepless nights; what does is what is happening now. Thus, when I say I want to understand Indian culture, I am not harking back to some &lsquo;golden age&rsquo;, my friend, but India as I know it today. To understand this India, I need to understand how her traditions are <em>lived</em> today, not what they perhaps meant one thousand years ago.</p>

      <p>I have had difficulties in understanding the use and meaning of some words, especially &rsquo;essentialism&rsquo; and its cognates. Here are some uses of &ldquo;essentialism&rdquo; I am familiar with.</p>
<ol>
<li>One uses &rsquo;essences&rsquo; to designate some basic or fundamental or determining properties of an object, as in: &ldquo;Water is essentially H2O&rdquo;. Here the claim is that some liquid is water if and only if it has the chemical structure of containing two molecules of Hydrogen and one molecule of Oxygen for every single molecule of the liquid in question.</li>
<li>One uses &rsquo;essences&rsquo; in order to understand counterfactual sentences involving proper nouns, as in: &ldquo;If I were George Bush, I would not have gone to war with Iraq&rdquo;. This sentence is a counterfactual because it begins by assuming a non-fact (I am Balu and not George Bush); picks out a state of affairs where this is true (a possible world where &lsquo;Balu&rsquo; IS &lsquo;George Bush&rsquo;) and makes a (true or false) statement about this (I might or might not have gone to war with Iraq). Many historical claims (and many scientific laws) have the form of counterfactual statements. Here &rsquo;essence&rsquo; is predicated to Balu (something like &ldquo;baluhood&rdquo;) so that Balu remains Balu even if he were to become &lsquo;George Bush&rsquo; in some possible world.</li>
<li>One uses &rsquo;essences&rsquo; to solve the problem of providing references to proper names, as in &ldquo;Socrates was not a teacher of Plato&rdquo;. In many cases, we identify Socrates as that person who has the property of &lsquo;being a teacher of Plato&rsquo;. If it transpires that such is not the case, we will still not be in doubt about the identity of Socrates because, much like the previous case, it speaks about some &rsquo;essential property&rsquo; of Socrates by virtue of which he remains the same person even when he does not have some or another accidental or contingent property.</li>
<li>One uses &rsquo;essences&rsquo; while solving the puzzle of identity, as in &ldquo;This is me, a photograph taken when I was three years old&rdquo;. Here, &lsquo;me, when I was three years old&rsquo;, &lsquo;me in America during the 1990 AAR conference&rsquo; etc. become spatio-temporal slices of an &lsquo;I&rsquo;. The &lsquo;I&rsquo; has indefinitely many spatio-temporal slices and these are all slices of one and the same &lsquo;I&rsquo;. The idea is that one does not become someone else other than who one is because of the spatio-temporal career of &lsquo;oneself&rsquo;.</li>
</ol>
<p>Even though there are many discussions about each of these uses, there is nothing wrong or illegitimate about using the word &rsquo;essence&rsquo; or indeed to &ldquo;talk in an essentializing way&rdquo;. Quite obviously, the &lsquo;subaltern&rsquo; historiographers could not mean &rsquo;essentialism&rsquo; in any of the above senses, because they suggest that essentialism is something to avoid. I know of one such use of the word in Said&rsquo;s &ldquo;Orientalism&rdquo;, where he suggests that to correlate climatic conditions with the psychology or culture of a people (something that often happened in the eighteenth nineteenth centuries) is to commit the sin of essentialism. Clearly, this is not the kind of essentialism that is at issue here.</p>
