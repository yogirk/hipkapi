      <p>While translating Russell L. Ackoff, you say that such a translation is &ldquo;not a moral judgment now, but a statement about the state of the economy&rdquo;. But your claim, according to Ackoff&rsquo;s own argument, is untrue.</p>
<ol>
<li>Consider how he describes corruption: &ldquo;We concluded that corruption occurs when one party, A (for example, a policeman), who has an obligation to a second party, B (for example, the government), to provide service to a third party, C (for example, a member of the public), serves C in such a way as to benefit A more than he or she is supposed to. In addition, anyone who induces another to behave corruptly is corrupt. Therefore, corruption is the exploitation for one&rsquo;s personal benefit of a position in which one is expected to serve others.&rdquo;</li>
</ol>
<p>B (the policeman) has an obligation to serve C (a member of the public) and this obligation is a moral obligation; A has a derived moral obligation to serve C because A is under the moral obligation to do what B (the government) expects him to. A violates his moral obligation to B because as a part of B, he serves C in such a way that A benefits more, that is, A&rsquo;s (moral) abuse of his position makes him receive more benefits than he morally deserves. (What A deserves by virtue is serving C is a moral reward.) In this sense, Ackoff is making a moral claim.</p>

<p>I was invited by some Sadhus from Swami Narayan Temple (BAPS) to visit the temple and have a discussion with them. Because they practice very strict Brahmacharya (eight types of avoiding women, each correlated to an organ: it is called Ashtanga Brahmacharya), the Sadhus said that women could not be present during our discussions, while they were welcome to visit the temple. As I remember the incident, my female students were a bit &lsquo;upset&rsquo; (hurt, insulted, indignant, or whatever) that the Sadhus were not able to meet them and felt <strong>discriminated against</strong> by virtue of their sex. A few years later, one of my teachers from Belgium visited another wing of the Swami Narayan people and found that &lsquo;women were discriminated against&rsquo; because they were allowed only to come some distance from the temple when the Sadhus were present. In both cases, I was puzzled by their reaction: I explained that the action of the Sadhus should not be seen as an act of discrimination against women but as an expression of the strict Brahmacharya that the Sadhus practiced. The question here is: why did these people (my students and my teacher) experience &lsquo;discrimination&rsquo;, where I saw none and also knew that none was intended?</p>

      <p>Ideas have impact on people. Theological dilemmas have impact on those who formulate such dilemmas and on the future generations. They undertake actions (of whatever type) to solve these dilemmas, where and when these people find such dilemmas important. In this way, one can make some sense of the claim that Christological dilemma propels Christianity forward. However, this explanation cannot (at the stage our knowledge is in) be incorporated into a historical explanation: was Thomas Aquinas responding to the state of theology during his time, or was he a fame-hungry man who wrote his Summa Theologica in order to become famous, or was he afflicted by a rare disease?.? In other words, if we try to explain why St. Thomas wrote Summa, there are so many possibilities that a selection of any one possibility becomes a matter of taste and of one&rsquo;s pet theory. Moreover, even then, such a selection fails to tell us much about western history. Consequently, such an explanation cannot become a part of historical explanation, if the idea is to make history intelligible and coherent.</p>

      <p>Question: why religion spreads among (some) human beings? What is it about them that enables the transmission of religion?</p>
<p>This issue allows multiple answers. In this post, I would like to focus on the simplest answer to the question. In my theory, I presuppose an answer to the question: I assume that there is something in our constitution that allows religion to spread among human beings. The issue now is: why do I presuppose it, i.e. assume this state of affairs as a fact?</p>

      <p>We have developed partial explanations of why the secularism debate in India takes such peculiar forms and why otherwise intelligent people talk nonsense here. But we don&rsquo;t do so by pegging our use of the word secularism &ldquo;onto Balu&rsquo;s theory about the nature of religion and how that entity religion behaves in the world&rdquo; and then expecting that other people do the same.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Let me quickly repeat our argument: Concepts like religion and secularism and principles of the secular state developed in Europe against the background of larger conceptual frameworks. Broadly speaking, one knew what <code>religion' and 'the secular state' referred to or what the separation of </code>the religious&rsquo; and `the political&rsquo; amounted to, because these terms were embedded in such a common background framework. Naturally, there were many different positions and discontinuities in the debates. But disagreements about the precise meaning of terms or clashes between conflicting normative positions made sense to the participants, precisely because they occurred against the background of this type of framework. The framework put semantic limits on the potential interpretation of terms and principles, as it related concepts to each other in particular systematic ways. This background framework reflects not only generic Christian theology and political theory, but also the common cultural and historical experience of Europeans.</p>

In other words, is it possible to identify the problems with their accounts (that explicates more clearly why I say that they do not think) in such a way that it is susceptible to some sort of solution? If, indeed, we can show that such people do not think and we can show that their mistakes have some cognitive roots, then we can also provide additional explanations. In such a case, our answer would be richer and more complex than any other available at the market place.</p>

      <p>We do not have any clear explanation of the nature and rise of American identity politics as yet. But here are a few speculative intuitions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Identity politics seems to be the way in which the dominant culture in America compels other cultural communities to become variants of itself. It sustains a basic model of society which neutralizes groups that challenge the dominant culture by making them into cultural ghettos. As such, these groups can demand recognition of their distinct identity and fight for a just representation in education. But they can do so only within the conceptual limits fixed by the dominant culture. In this way, the other cultural communities are straitjacketed into the basic cultural structure of American society. This basic structure somehow reflects the mechanisms through which Christianity has always transformed the nonwestern cultures into variants of itself. As such, American society and its identity politics are secularized Christianity embodied in a socio-political model.</p>

<li>Vyasa&rsquo;s argument (to the extent we can speak of an argument in this context) is quite subtle: When Urvasi comes to Arjuna at the behest of his father, and when she is possessed by desire, and when the Apsaras choose freely and unconfined, then (a) one cannot reject her; (b) and with the argument that she is a superior to him. If you split this conjunction and cast in normative terms, it says something like this: (a) Rejection of a woman is not permitted when one&rsquo;s father indicates that a son should sleep with a woman; (b) Rejection of a woman is not permitted when the woman is sexually attracted to oneself; (c) Rejection of a woman, whoever she might be, is not permitted when she chooses freely and without confines. Because such a rejection is triply prohibited (or forbidden), Arjuna&rsquo;s argument that he &lsquo;ought not&rsquo; to sleep with the parent of his race (which has only one prohibition) possesses less value. So, Urvasi is justified in her curse of Arjuna. In other words, if we read this fragment of Mahabharata in normative terms, Arjuna was wrong in not having an incestuous relationship with one of his great-great-grandparents.</li>
</ol>
<p>1&rsquo;. While one could argue that one &lsquo;ought not&rsquo; to sleep with the &lsquo;superiors&rsquo;, Urvasi suggests that because she has chosen freely, this argument is void. On top of saying why Arjuna is wrong to reject sleeping with her, she also comes up with two other reasons why he could sleep with her: (a) Arjuna&rsquo;s ancestors have done so and without committing any &lsquo;sin&rsquo;; therefore, it is &lsquo;permissible&rsquo; that he does the same; (b)  it is a morally good thing to emulate one&rsquo;s ancestors and therefore Arjuna &lsquo;ought to&rsquo; sleep with her.</p>

      <p>Let us begin with the assumption that our stories about Indra and the Gandharvas are just that: stories, authored by human beings, without truth-content. (That is to say, they are neither true nor false.) When human beings write stories, their imagination is (partially) constrained by their societies, cultures and the times they live in. None quite knows how exactly the latter constrain human imagination even though the extant theories about myths try to explicate this relation: some see in them a mirroring of society, some see in them a disguised historiography or sociology, some see in them a personification of virtues, and so on. Because this issue is not settled yet, I shall presuppose the truth of none of the theories about myths that dot the landscape. However, I take the &lsquo;constraint&rsquo; I spoke about to incorporate the following minimal claim: the myths suggest that some attitudes fall within the limits (or transgress them, as the case may be) of the cultures whose myths they are. Under this assumption, let me isolate some of the attitudes that come to the fore if we look at our stories about apsaras.</p>

      <p>Contrast sets have multiple functions depending on the contexts in which they are used. For instance, in the case of theories about some phenomena, they can be used to test the robustness of the theories: why do unsupported objects on earth fall downwards instead of floating? Why did the Primitive Man invent &lsquo;religion&rsquo; instead of doing any number of other things he could have done? And so on. In such cases, one might be looking for reasons to accept an explanation temporarily or one might even be comparing rival explanations.</p>

      <p>X says: &ldquo;Modern prostitution is a very specific institution with the features of pimps, forced sex, kidnapped women, drug addicted women, immigrants lured to foreign shores on false pretences, and so on. If we insist on precision in ideas, then it is counterproductive to confuse matters by calling Apsaras prostitutes without first showing that at least some of the above conditions hold true and there is some structural similarity.&rdquo;</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Indeed, &lsquo;modern&rsquo; prostitution is all these things and more. However, I did not claim anywhere that Apsaras are &lsquo;modern&rsquo; prostitutes in any sense of the word. Nor did I suggest that there was &lsquo;institutionalized prostitution&rsquo; in India or that our stories suggest that there is such an institution in &lsquo;Swarga&rsquo;. The whole discussion is about a single sentence and I responded by laying out my reasons to call Apsaras as &lsquo;prostitutes in the court of Indra&rsquo;. To say today what I thought was evident (&rsquo;evident&rsquo; because that is what I learned as a child), I do not need to have any kind of a specific theory about &lsquo;modern prostitution&rsquo; or even one about what &lsquo;prostitution&rsquo; generally is about.</p>

<p>In so far as the suggestion is that the English word &lsquo;prostitute&rsquo; does not capture the connotations of the earlier uses of &lsquo;Veshya&rsquo;, as I said, I agree with all of you. In this sense, if you further suggest that &lsquo;Apsara&rsquo; should not be considered as a synonym for &lsquo;prostitute&rsquo;, I would also agree. I do not suggest that &lsquo;apsara&rsquo; and &lsquo;prostitute&rsquo; are synonyms: for two words to be synonymous in this context, we need that both words refer to one and the same set of objects. This cannot be the case here because &lsquo;apsara&rsquo; picks out only non-human entities, whereas &lsquo;prostitute&rsquo; can also refer to human beings. I would also be grateful if anyone has a better suggestion for translating &lsquo;Veshya&rsquo;. As I said in an earlier post,&lsquo;courtesan&rsquo; is an alternative. However, a &lsquo;courtesan&rsquo; is also a prostitute, whatever else she is. On this, linguistic part, there are no disagreements.</p>

<li>You suggest that calling Apsaras as &ldquo;prostitutes in the court of Indra&rdquo; is an extreme statement. Of course, you would be right if you mean that the English word does not carry all the connotations of &lsquo;Veshya&rsquo; or even that our current usage of the word &lsquo;Veshya&rsquo; is not as rich as the earlier uses of the same word were. You are right too when you point out that the word &lsquo;Kama&rsquo;, as a pursushartha, embraces a bigger set than sexual pleasure or romantic love. Perhaps, one might prefer the word &lsquo;courtesan&rsquo; to &lsquo;prostitute&rsquo; but that distorts the Indian &lsquo;Veshya&rsquo; too: a courtesan was either a mistress of the wealthy or a prostitute who entertained only the rich. However, I am not sure whether my claim is really that extreme (with the proviso that we keep in mind the current-day changes in the meanings of the words in both English and Indian languages). Let me explain why.</li>
</ol>
<p>When we read, say, Kamasutra, we discover that prostitutes had to be cultured and learned human beings; they were supposed to be proficient in multiple arts including music, poetry, dance, handicrafts and so on. &lsquo;Treating the prostitutes humanely&rsquo; includes teaching these skills to them: after all, many of the arts they practiced to entertain men requires teaching and learning. This suggests that a teacher could take prostitutes as his/her students and that the society did not disapprove. Instead, it countenanced such teaching. However, this is not all there is to the story. Consider the fact that a prostitute is also called &rsquo;nitya sumangali&rsquo;: one who can never become a widow. As you know, the word &lsquo;sumangali&rsquo; is not usedlightly in India and it carries a very positive connotation as is also indexed by the use of &lsquo;su&rsquo;. (Of course, one uses this term also sarcastically in colloquial language but such use does not take away the positive connotation.) Even though the prostitute never marries, our traditions did not withhold the appellation &lsquo;sumangali&rsquo; from her. Consider too, in this context, the &lsquo;good qualities&rsquo; of a wife: &lsquo;Karyeshu dasi, Karaneshu mantri&hellip;.&rsquo; As this verse (I have forgotten both its source and how it ends) continues, it appears that a wife should also be &lsquo;shayaneshu veshya&rsquo; (a prostitute in bed). Quite independent of the conjectures we can make about its anti-feministic character or whatever, think about what this verse is suggesting: the wife should behave like a prostitute in the bedroom. What does that mean? Whether or not it also means that she should entertain her husband through music, recitation of poetry, dance and such like, one thing is clear: she must be well-versed in sexual matters. Step back for a moment and ask yourself how any girl could be well-versed (better than her husband, in fact) in sexual matters. There are only two possibilities: either the girl had a lot of experience in sex before marriage (there goes the idea of virginity of one&rsquo;s wife) or she was trained and educated in the art of sex in her family. Irrespective of which of the possibilities is true, this verse indicates at least two things: being a prostitute did not make one immoral anymore than visiting a prostitute made one immoral. The prostitute had qualities which a &lsquo;good wife&rsquo; should emulate. Note that these qualities are not those that prostitutes also have; the wife is supposed to have those qualities that make a woman into a prostitute (&lsquo;shayaneshu veshya&rsquo;).  Furthermore, in so far as women were taught the &lsquo;art of loving&rsquo; (kama-sutra) in their families, surely, it tells us that the reaction of the middle class in India today is anything but Indian: it is an inherited prudishness drawn from the Victorian morality. It is in this sense that I suggested that the Indians are not prudes in matters of sexuality. In this sense too, in this Indian sense, Apsaras, I claim, are &ldquo;prostitutes in the court of Indra&rdquo;.</p>

      <p>1.1. The Indian traditions did not have the same attitude as Christianity towards prostitution or adultery. And the Indians of yesteryears were not defenders of the Victorian (and Christian) morality. Of course, I approvingly said that the &ldquo;Indians are not prudes&rdquo; but this approval has to do with the thrust of Indian thought, as I have understood it: the impossibility of prohibiting or making obligatory some or another action universally. (This is my formulation, of course.) I do believe that the Indians recognized the impossibility of abolishing prostitution (which is why it is called &ldquo;the oldest profession&rdquo;). Instead, therefore, of banning and condemning prostitution (and subsequently turn a blind eye towards its existence), Indian thinkers suggested that we treat the prostitutes humanely. I have never been to a prostitute nor will I ever go to one; but that does not mean that I want to ignore their existence and treat them as non-humans. Nor am I willing to call all those who visit prostitutes as criminals and perverts. I know of too many lonely men and women who have found human warmth and personal comfort in the arms and companionship of prostitutes to consider them as perverts.</p>

<p>Imagine that all human beings seek happiness. Imagine too that they can all achieve this state of being. Because, as I said in one of my posts, there are no qualifications (or requirements) to reach this end-state; any and all ways are conducive to reach this end-state: thinking, meditation, music, dance, and, yes, even going to temples and reciting &lsquo;sahasranaamams.&rsquo; At any and every stage and moment, people can achieve happiness.</p>

      <p>I think there is a simpler answer to why we do not eat beef: &ldquo;we do not see it as food.&rdquo; In the same way people in the Nazi concentration camps and the Ethiopians during the famine did not see fellow human beings as edible items, we do not see cows as food. (Contrast this with the story of a plane crash in the Andes Mountain some three decades ago, where the dead were cannibalized by the living in order to survive.) Culture, upbringing and even beliefs (in the case of some people) could help explain this situation. The central point, however, is that we do not see it as food.</p>

      <p>1. Here is one way of looking at what stories are. They are symbols. What are they symbols of? Well, they could symbolize acts; they could also be symbolically interpreted as justifications of such acts. Under this construal, a story requires an interpretation: one has to interpret the story as a symbol of either an act or as its symbolic justification. (The same applies to looking at stories as symbols of values. The stories, for instance, could be seen to symbolize virtues. Stories could also symbolize passions, feelings, natural forces&hellip;) Then, stories are mostly, if not always, symbols of something or another. When you look at the issue this way, it is almost akin to saying that stories are &ldquo;evidences&rdquo; of sorts: some story or another provides &ldquo;evidence&rdquo; about the presence of &ldquo;something else&rdquo;. (Let us leave aside the issue of what it means to talk of a symbol in all these contexts or what &ldquo;evidence&rdquo; means here. Both terms can be understood in a vague sense for our purposes.) In another language, we can say that all stories are signs. These signs must be turned into signifiers (this requires an act of interpretation) by showing or suggesting that they signify &ldquo;something else&rdquo; (called the signified).</p>

      <p>A science of cultures is not Atmagyaana or Brahmagyaana. Let me also add that I find a quest for happiness a normal human striving.</p>
<p>According to the Indian traditions, experience itself is a state of being: anubhava. In my story, so is happiness (or atmasaakshaatkaara). Need one be enlightened in order to speak about enlightenment? Should that be the case, one cannot strive for enlightenment at all and I think that enlightenment (or happiness) is a legitimate goal for human beings. If happiness is not an esoteric state of being but a legitimate goal for all human beings, there are indefinitely many roads to that state of being. The strength of the Indian traditions lies not merely in recognizing this but also in working out many such routes.</p>

      <ol>
<li>Why did Christianity become a &lsquo;universal&rsquo; religion? How did Christians replace the &lsquo;chosen&rsquo; people? What was the logic behind the transformation of the Jewish god into God of the humankind?</li>
</ol>
<p>In the literature on the subject that I have read, the first two questions get a historical (semi-psychological) answer. Traces of this answer can also be found between the lines in &lsquo;The Heathen…&rsquo;. There is a great deal of theological discussion on the third issue but I have not followed them.</p>
