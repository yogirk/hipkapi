<li>So far, our answers have always taken this form: in the moment of secularization, the formal structures or cognitive schemes of Christianity are diffused accordingly as they lose their specific doctrinal content. In this formulation, it is as though the logical form of religion is able to spread itself by disposing of its semantic content. Thus, both the common sense of the West and the scholarly consensus of the academia accept the background assumptions of Christian doctrine, while they do not adopt its specific teachings. Balu has always been somewhat unhappy about this formulation. As he argues in <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/colonialconsciousness/theheatheninhisblindness">chapter 11 of `The Heathen in his blindness: Asia, the West and the dynamic of religion&rsquo;</a>, it is not a specific set of assumptions which spreads in society, but rather certain attitudes. The claims about the universality of religion, the meaning of life, the necessity of norms, the superiority of liberal democracy, etc. do not generally appear as explicit premises held by a group of people. Then, it seems the only explanation one can give is to ascribe them to these people as implicit assumptions. To some extent, this works: theories about the origin of religion, or the nature of morality, or human psychology all presuppose that certain assumptions are true. So if one intends to reveal the conceptual problems of these theories, it is fruitful to analyze these assumptions as the hidden premises of theorizing.</li>
</ol>
<p>However, when it comes to explaining how the Christian religion spreads in a secular form, these accounts are unconvincing. What happens? Do the implicit assumptions or formalized theological schemes expand their scope as a kind of unit ideas by jumping from mind to mind? In what realm do these assumptions and background frameworks exist and procreate? The problem becomes acute when we turn to the spread of secularized Christianity in pagan societies like the Indian. Do the elite of alienated intellectuals suddenly adopt these assumptions as the starting points of reasoning about politics and society? Do they spread automatically from the colonized elite to other layers of Indian society, because this is a basic dynamic of societies? Such answers would be unsatisfactory. But what then is the mechanism through which secularized religious schemes spread and structure the experience of an ever increasing number of individuals? This and other related questions have been bothering me for some time (not least because I have failed to solve any of them in my doctoral thesis).</p>

      <p>We have developed partial explanations of why the secularism debate in India takes such peculiar forms and why otherwise intelligent people talk nonsense here. But we don&rsquo;t do so by pegging our use of the word secularism &ldquo;onto Balu&rsquo;s theory about the nature of religion and how that entity religion behaves in the world&rdquo; and then expecting that other people do the same.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Let me quickly repeat our argument: Concepts like religion and secularism and principles of the secular state developed in Europe against the background of larger conceptual frameworks. Broadly speaking, one knew what <code>religion' and 'the secular state' referred to or what the separation of </code>the religious&rsquo; and `the political&rsquo; amounted to, because these terms were embedded in such a common background framework. Naturally, there were many different positions and discontinuities in the debates. But disagreements about the precise meaning of terms or clashes between conflicting normative positions made sense to the participants, precisely because they occurred against the background of this type of framework. The framework put semantic limits on the potential interpretation of terms and principles, as it related concepts to each other in particular systematic ways. This background framework reflects not only generic Christian theology and political theory, but also the common cultural and historical experience of Europeans.</p>

      <p>We do not have any clear explanation of the nature and rise of American identity politics as yet. But here are a few speculative intuitions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Identity politics seems to be the way in which the dominant culture in America compels other cultural communities to become variants of itself. It sustains a basic model of society which neutralizes groups that challenge the dominant culture by making them into cultural ghettos. As such, these groups can demand recognition of their distinct identity and fight for a just representation in education. But they can do so only within the conceptual limits fixed by the dominant culture. In this way, the other cultural communities are straitjacketed into the basic cultural structure of American society. This basic structure somehow reflects the mechanisms through which Christianity has always transformed the nonwestern cultures into variants of itself. As such, American society and its identity politics are secularized Christianity embodied in a socio-political model.</p>

<li>The absence of supernatural entities in the Indian traditions may seem counterintuitive to many. We can let someone else do the talking for us, namely Dale B. Martin in his interesting book <em>Inventing Superstition: from the Hippocratics to the Christians</em> (Harvard University Press, 2004):</li>
</ol>
<p>&ldquo;One of the basic arguments of this book is that, contrary to many modern assumptions, the category of &ldquo;the supernatural&rdquo; did not exist in ancient culture <em>as</em> <em>a category</em>. Neither popular notions, held by the vast majority of inhabitants of the ancient world, nor philosophical notions (we could say &ldquo;scientific&rdquo; with due consideration for the possible anachronistic connotations of the term) assumed that reality was split up into two realms, one &ldquo;natural,&rdquo; containing things like &ldquo;matter&rdquo; and &ldquo;natural forces&rdquo; such as gravity or electricity, and another &ldquo;supernatural,&rdquo; to which gods and similar beings (demigods, angels, demons, ghosts) could be assigned&hellip; What is important for this post is that the category was not available, either explicitly or by assumption, for persons in the classical Greek and Roman worlds. The Greeks and Romans certainly had no <em>word</em> that was equivalent to the modern English &ldquo;supernatural.&rdquo;&hellip;I do not, however, want just to quibble about words. Classical Greeks and Latin had not term for what passes in the modern world as &ldquo;the supernatural&rdquo; precisely because the ancients did not separate out divine forces and beings from &ldquo;nature&rdquo; and relegate them to a separate ontological realm that could designated by its own label. Generally, for ancient people whatever does exist exists in &ldquo;nature.&rdquo; Almost without exception the Greek term <em>physis</em> (nature) refers to &ldquo;all that is.&rdquo; People might argue that the gods did not exist or that some particular daimon or god or superhuman being did not exist (I know of no ancient author who argued for actual atheism in the modern sense). But in that case, they said that the disputed entity simply did not exist, not that it might exist in some other realm of reality, such as the &ldquo;supernatural.&rdquo; Ancient philosophers might argue that lightning was not caused by a god, but they did not do so by pointing out that lightning occurs in the &ldquo;natural&rdquo; realm and that the gods exist in the &ldquo;supernatural&rdquo; realm and that the two realms are not supposed to interact with one another. Ancient people took the gods and all other beings we would think of as &ldquo;supernatural&rdquo; to be <em>part</em> of nature if they existed at all.&rdquo; (pp. 13-15)</p>

    <div class="post-excerpt">
      <p>While reading Shabnum Tejani&rsquo;s *Indian Secularism: A Social and Intellectual History (*2008), I ran into the same weird point that Neera Chandhoke also tried to make at the RRI platform debate on secularism. This is a combination of the old claim that &lsquo;secularism&rsquo; has acquired a different meaning in India and a general theoretical point: &lsquo;secularism does not have any essence or universal meaning, but gets different meanings dependent on the historical and cultural contexts in which it has developed&rsquo;. There are different variations on this formulation, but the general point is one that is becoming increasingly popular (especially among historians), because of the influence of Talal Asad and other postmodernators. Hence, I wanted to try and address the point by taking the example of Tejani&rsquo;s work.</p>
