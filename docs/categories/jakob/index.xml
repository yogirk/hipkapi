      <title>The Swami, the Priest, and the Rediscovery of the Indian Traditions</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I will take up some of the general points, which I think are relevant to the Indian American community at large. First, let me say I am impressed by the dynamism present in this community. In spite of the demands of daily life, Indian Americans find the time and energy to engage in intellectual debates about the nature of their traditions. In spite of the discrimination and &amp;ldquo;religion oppression&amp;rdquo; [1] faced by them, there is a general sense of optimism about the future of these traditions.&#xA;It is important that this dynamism remain a positive force. Some Indian Americans have adopted the name-calling that we find among certain American academics. Whereas the latter call anyone who dares say a few positive words about the Indian traditions &amp;ldquo;a Hindutva sycophant,&amp;rdquo; the former trend to label any western intellectual who dares question the dominant representations of the Indian traditions as a &amp;ldquo;Witzellian.&amp;rdquo; The legitimate discontent about the academic representation of the Indian traditions should not lead us to a general anti-intellectual stance. Anti-intellectualism knows only one endpoint: the &lt;em&gt;Taliban&lt;/em&gt;. Now, if there is one community aware of the duty to avoid that society moves towards that point, it is the Indian American community. Since intellectuals share this sense of duty, our study of the Indian traditions should show how they can contribute to making American society a more tolerant, open-minded and happier society.&#xA;As Chitra Raman affirms, the Indian traditions have been conceptualized in an extremely impoverished manner during the last few centuries. It is the hypothesis of our research group that this is the case because they have been viewed &lt;em&gt;through a secularized biblical framework&lt;/em&gt;. [2] The same framework also puts conceptual limitations on the structure of American pluralism. This is not an assessment about the origins of this form of pluralism or a judgment about its biased nature, but rather a &lt;em&gt;cognitive&lt;/em&gt; analysis of its contemporary structure. Such an analysis cannot be challenged by a moralizing judgement (e.g., that it justifies discrimination). The only way to really challenge my hypothesis is to develop another hypothesis about the structure of American pluralism. Naturally, its purpose is to develop new ways of solving the problems of pluralism in the U.S. To do so, one should indeed strive to bring American pluralism beyond its biblical straitjacket in the near future. Perhaps, no group is as qualified to do so as the Indian Americans.&#xA;But before they can take up this task, they should understand the depth of the predicament. Even more so, they have to become aware that they have appropriated the secularized Christian conception of the Indian traditions as a self-description. The predicament we face is &lt;em&gt;cognitive&lt;/em&gt; in nature: the currently dominant conception of the Indian traditions makes sense only against the background of the biblical framework. It is cognitive in the sense that the way we currently think and talk about “Hinduism” leads to a distortion of the very nature of the Indian traditions. This dominant conception of “Hinduism” does not describe these traditions themselves, but rather &lt;em&gt;how they appear through western and Christian lenses&lt;/em&gt;. Yet many Indians and Indian Americans talk as though this conception makes eminent sense to them.&#xA;Chitra Raman develops a nice analogy: it is like using the grammar of one language to understand another. One may adopt the words of the second language, but when one embeds them in the grammatical structure of the first language, one ends up with virtual gibberish. The analogy can be taken further: today, it is as though the native speakers of the second language have accepted the grammatical structure of the first language as the only correct one and they try to speak their own language in this way. This is the nature of our predicament: many Indians and Indian Americans have adopted the conceptual framework of Christianity to talk about their own traditions. They assume the Indian traditions are a belief system or religion with its own doctrines, commandments and rules. As I will try to show, this makes about as much sense as using the grammatical structure of one language to speak another completely different language.&#xA;To avoid any misunderstanding, let it be clear that the denial that the Indian traditions are of the same nature as biblical religion does not involve any value judgement. They also have a highly-developed structure, but this is so different from Judaism, Christianity and Islam that it is impossible to maintain that the Indian traditions and the latter three are instances of the same kind. In fact, once we appreciate how different the Indian traditions are from these religions, we will rediscover how rich and valuable they really are. To return to the language analogy: if we used the grammatical structure of one language to speak another, we would not be able to understand this second language and would also ignore its rich contributions to literature, philosophy and poetry. It is only when we rediscover the structure of this second language that its treasures become available to us. Similarly, when we rediscover the nature of the Indian traditions and rescue them from being transformed into just another religion, we will be able to show how they have contributed to the pursuit of knowledge at a level undreamt of.&#xA;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Priest and the Swami&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&#xA;In &lt;em&gt;Facing the Challenge of American Pluralism&lt;/em&gt;, I argued that the Indian traditions revolve around the exploring and examining of one’s experience so as to attain perfect happiness. What does this mean? How is it different from what religions like Christianity and Islam do? As an entry point, take a Hindu swamiji and a Christian priest. The priest says “God is a Trinity.” The swamiji says “&lt;em&gt;Tat Tvam Asi&lt;/em&gt;.” What is the difference between the two?&#xA;First the priest. The sentence “God is a Trinity” is a doctrine to him; it is a proposition about the world, which he takes to be absolutely true. Because it is a doctrine, the sentence is embedded in an elaborate theological system. It is related to other sentences that explain its true meaning: theological doctrines about Jesus being the Son of God and the Father, the Son and the Spirit being one substance, but three persons. Arguments have been developed to establish the truth of the Trinitarian doctrine. Its correct formulation was discussed and fixed at the First Council of Nicea in 325 AD. The result is the Nicene Creed: a set of beliefs that are held to reflect religious truth by most Christian denominations. As a Christian believer, when the priest says “God is a Trinity,” one is expected to accept this as a true belief, a doctrine embedded in a belief system that claims the one and only religious truth. As an orthodox Christian today, one should understand this doctrine, proclaim its truth and be able to defend it against its detractors. One should not question its truth and meaning. These have been fixed for good.&#xA;Now the swamiji. When he states “&lt;em&gt;Tat Tvam Asi&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt;”&lt;/em&gt; does he expect all Hindus to accept this sentence as a true doctrine? Does he want them to take this as a true belief, whose truth they should proclaim and defend against the “false beliefs” of other religions? Does he expect them to memorize the sentence and its related doctrines and arguments, and repeat them until eternity? No, he does not. When the swamiji teaches, he takes into account the different levels and experiences of his audience. He will explain “&lt;em&gt;Tat Tvam Asi&lt;/em&gt;” in different ways according to the different experiential levels of individuals. The sentence does not have one fixed true meaning, precisely because it functions as an instruction for exploring one’s own experience. It suggests that the distinction between I and not-I is a temporary figment that results from interpreting our experience in a particular way. If we examine this experience at a deeper level, we will slowly discover that there is no such distinction there. The swamiji’s explanation of the sentence will make sense to us, according to where we are on the path towards this discovery.&#xA;Hence, neither the speech of the &lt;em&gt;swamiji&lt;/em&gt; nor the texts of the Indian traditions can be understood as belief systems or doctrines, which have a fixed meaning and claim to reflect the one religious truth. They are “heuristics” that function as instructions for action to explore our own experience. To attain the insights embodied in these sentences, one has to examine them from all sides, relate them to one’s experience and question their truth repeatedly. Only in this way can they help us become better and happier human beings. The claim of the Indian traditions is not that we should accept them as true doctrines or that such acceptance is a precondition for attaining salvation. They do not postpone perfect happiness until after death. Neither do they claim that there is only one true path to attain this state. Rather, they claim that all human beings can attain perfect happiness here on earth and that there are countless ways to achieve this goal.&#xA;Those who conceptualize the Indian traditions as “belief systems,” “doctrines” or “religion” take away the unique nature of these traditions. They make the rich storehouse of experiential knowledge embodied by these traditions inaccessible and do so by transforming them into a belief system, the Hindu equivalent of Christianity or Islam. Let it be clear that the Indian traditions are neither belief systems nor religions. They are far more fascinating than that. I refer you to the piece by my teacher S. N. Balagangadhara (soon to be published on the India Forum website) to get a glimpse of how rich these traditions are. Here, just note that it is &lt;em&gt;precisely the way in which the Indian traditions are different from belief systems, which makes them into extremely important but uncharted contributions to the human pursuit of knowledge&lt;/em&gt;.&#xA;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transforming the Swami into a Priest&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&#xA;But what happens when we reduce the Indian traditions into a Hindu “religion,” “world view” or “belief system”? What are the consequences of transforming the swamiji into a priest? Why is this development so harmful?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Between ignorance and deception: Satish Deshpande&#39;s idea of reservations</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Clearly, advocates of the caste-based reservation system are worried by the recent upheavals in Gujarat and beyond. In his &amp;ldquo;The Patidar idea of reservations&amp;rdquo; (&lt;em&gt;The Hindu&lt;/em&gt;, September 5), Delhi University sociologist Satish Deshpande attempts to ridicule the Patidars&amp;rsquo; demand for OBC status while expressing his support for the reservation system. In this piece, I do not wish to defend or attack any particular movement, such as that of the Patidars or the Gujjars, but merely draw attention to one simple point: Deshpande attempts to defend ignorance and immorality by drawing on arguments that exhibit the same properties.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/why-smriti-irani-as-hrd-minister-was-a-terrible-choice/&#34;&gt;recent piece&lt;/a&gt; on the valedictory speech of the minister of HRD at a Kolkata workshop elicited many replies from the readers. Some found that we indulged in a personal attack, our piece lacked &amp;ldquo;logic&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;argumentation&amp;rdquo; and one of her secret admirers, in her defence, even sent us a link to a report by Saptadwipa Ghosal in &lt;em&gt;The Echo of India&lt;/em&gt;. Such responses demand an adequate reply. Actually, we wanted to show how profound her new education policy is and we failed in demonstrating it. In this piece, through the use of sophisticated hermeneutics, we shall make our mistake good.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;From the mouth of some babes, pearls of wisdom and truth fall like gentle rain from heaven. From the mouth of others, idiocies pour in a torrent and are considered truth only because they occupy positions of power. We leave it to the reader to decide to which group our minister of human resource development Smriti Irani belongs. Keep in mind that she determines to a large extent the course of education, including higher education policies in India. Irani&amp;rsquo;s comments on education at the conclusion of the National Seminar on the New Education Policy in Kolkata would be shocking if they were made by a mature and intelligent human being. But, as is said, from the mouth of the babes&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Indian Jews</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;social science debate in India has been hijacked by the struggle between secularism and&lt;em&gt;Hindutva&lt;/em&gt; for decades now. usually the &lt;em&gt;Sangh Parivar&lt;/em&gt; is blamed for this turn of events. However, it could well be argued that the &lt;em&gt;Hindutva&lt;/em&gt; ideologues simply adopted the stance of the secularists.  Perhaps the best illustration is the case of anti-Brahminism.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To be against &amp;ldquo;Brahminism&amp;rdquo; is part and parcel of the political correctness of progressive scholars in twenty-first-century India, much like being against Muslims is part of the message of their &lt;em&gt;Hindutva&lt;/em&gt; colleagues. This indicates that something is very wrong with the Indian academic debate. Promotion of animosity towards a religious tradition or its followers is not acceptable today, but it becomes truly perverse when the intelligentsia endorses it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How free are we?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This has been a tumultuous decade for the academic study of India. In his recent &lt;em&gt;Offence: The Hindu Case&lt;/em&gt; (2009), Salil Tripathi provides a timely overview of the growing censorship and harassment that scholars working on India have faced. Not a pretty sight to behold: people have felt the need to ban books and terrorize authors, hassle teachers and disrupt classes, toss eggs at some and blacken others’ faces. Academics now run the risk of smear campaigns, court cases and physical intimidation; all because certain groups feel offended by what they write about the Indian past or the Hindu traditions. The facts are difficult to miss. Hence, the threat that Hindu nationalism poses to academic freedom has caused commotion around the world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Dark Hour of Secularism: Hindu Fundamentalism and Colonial Liberalism in India</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The relation between religion and politics remains one of the important issues of our time. The discussions on this relation swing between two extremes: religious fundamentalism and liberal secularism. These are regarded as opposites. As the liberal perspective sees it, the secular state and its principles of neutrality and toleration are antidotes to religious fundamentalism[1]. Recently, this view has been challenged. Several authors point out that fundamentalism and secularism are not self-contained opposites, but are intertwined in significant ways[2].&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>US Commission for International Christian Freedom</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The annual reports of the US Commission for International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) have long irked politicians and citizens from countries placed on its ‘watch list’. This is no different in India. In the 2015 report released about a fortnight ago, the country again occupies an unenviable spot in Tier 2, which includes countries where the religious freedom violations engaged in or tolerated by the government are serious.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Striking about this year’s report, however, is its claim that incidents of religiously-motivated and communal violence have ‘reportedly’ increased for three consecutive years in India. “According to Muslim and Christian NGOs that track communal incidents,” it adds, “2014 statistics, yet to be released by the ministry, will be likely higher” than the 823 incidents recorded in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rape of a Country&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Jakob De Roover&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt; Imagine. A filmmaker travels to Belgium because she has heard about the pedophilia scandals in the country. She directs a documentary film including an interview with an infamous pedophile, who says that the girls he raped had actually seduced him and that they really enjoyed it. The filmmaker then comments that Belgian society is responsible for creating such pedophiles by teaching them what to think. Most men in this country are programmed in this way, she insists. In fact, this is all part of a larger disease and culture, which is also reflected in Belgian cinema. How would we Belgians react? We would find this shocking and infuriating. It is as though pedophilia is an expression of the core of our culture, as though we are programmed for child abuse.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Magic of ‘Radicalization’?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After the Paris attacks came the questions: Is this violence caused by Islam or unrelated to religion? Are the perpetrators believers or madmen? Do they represent the extremists that we find in any ideology?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The responses were diverse: ‘Islam is a threat to free speech’. But many Muslims joined the protest marches in defence of the freedom of expression. ‘Not all Muslims are terrorists, but most terrorists are Muslims’. The statistics show otherwise. ‘Madmen have neither colour nor religion’. Yet the ‘professionals’ in Paris screamed ‘Allahu Akbar’.  And then appeared the magical word ‘radicalization’. From the mayor to the teacher, from the politician to the policeman, everyone now knows what the problem is and where we should look for solutions: strict measures against ‘radicalized Muslims’ and ‘deradicalization programmes’ developed by ‘radicalization experts’.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Defininition vs hypothesis: religion</title>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One confuses between a definition and a hypothesis. Definitions tell us how we use a word and which objects it refers to. In the case of the term ‘religion’, a definition should merely address this referential task: which things are we referring to, when we use this word. It cannot give us any understanding of the structure or properties of religion and does not have empirical consequences (much as defining any other word, say ‘species’ or ‘psychosis’, does not have empirical consequences). It merely points out the phenomena that are to be theorized. The result of this second process of theorizing is a hypothesis, which characterizes the properties or structure of a phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Colonial Consciousness: M.N. Srinivas and Sanskritization</title>
      <link>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/colonial-consciousness-m-n-srinivas-and-sanskritization/</link>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;M. N. Srinivas (MNS) claims that &amp;ldquo;a caste was able, in a generation or two, to rise to a higher position in the hierarchy by adopting vegetarianism and teetotalism and by changing its rituals and deities.&amp;rdquo; The first basic problem here is how one can establish the position of a jati in the supposed hierarchy and measure it in such detail that one can see over two generations that the jati has attained a higher position. Which standard does one use to establish the position of jati x? What members of jati x say about its position relative to other jatis? What members of other jatis say about the position of x relative to their own jatis? As our fieldwork in Karnataka has already shown, it is impossible to infer any hierarchy from such empirical data, because all one gets is a series of inconsistent statements with regard to the relative positions of jatis. This basic problem becomes even more intractable when we take into account the history of assigning positions to jatis in the so-called &amp;ldquo;caste hierarchy&amp;rdquo;. When the British had their caste census in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, many jatis classified as shudras or untouchables sent in petitions arguing that they held higher positions; they were kshatriyas, they said. Today, the same jatis insist that they are really shudras or untouchables and should be classified as OBCs or SCs. When jatis can radically revise their &amp;lsquo;position in the hierarchy&amp;rsquo; according to the status or benefits they win by doing so, what could one ever conclude about their position and how it changes over generations?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Should one calculate the average socio-economic level of jati x and compare it to the average level of other jatis? Apart from difficulties in calculating this socio-economic level, one faces an even more difficult problem: how does one circumscribe jati x? Are two groups with the same name both sub-divisions of jati x? What if they claim they are different jatis? What geographical or social unit should one begin with to establish the (socio-economic) position of jati x in the hierarchy? Let us say one takes the village as the relevant unit. How does the socio-economic level that jati x enjoys in some village tell us anything about its position in the hierarchy? If the socio-economic welfare of jati x increases markedly over two generations in this village, does this mean it has attained a higher position? What if the same jati in the surrounding villages has declined? In terms of empirical data, then, it becomes impossible to say (a) what the position is of a jati in the supposed hierarchy and (b) when it has attained a higher position. In other words, MNS can never have inferred his conclusions about Sanskritization and castes rising to higher positions from his &amp;lsquo;fieldwork data&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Secular State and Religious Conflict: Liberal Neutrality and the Indian Case of Pluralism</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editor&amp;rsquo;s Note: This article appeared in the Journal of Political Philosophy. Authored by SN Balagangadhara and Jakob De Roover. For an alternative research programme (paradigm)  for studying India, Indian culture and Indian culture, study Balagangadhara&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;Reconceptualizing Indian Studies&lt;/strong&gt;, published by OUP, India.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are few places in the contemporary world where the problems of cultural pluralism are as acute as they are in India. The Indian case poses fundamental challenges to the political theory of toleration. By tackling the problem of religious conversion, our analysis shows that the dominant way of conceiving state neutrality becomes untenable in the Indian context. The Indian state, modelled after the liberal democracies in the West, is the harbinger of religious conflict in India because of its conception of toleration and state neutrality. More of &amp;lsquo;secularism&amp;rsquo; in India will end up feeding what it fights: the so-called &amp;lsquo;Hindu fundamentalism&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How do we understand the concept of Communal Violence?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We all agree that events like the Gujarat riots are tragic and terrible. But what is the role of intellectuals in avoiding similar tragedies in the future?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why can’t religion be political?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Obviously, the duty of the intellectual is to try and help us understand the nature of the events and the violence involved. In India and abroad, the concepts of ‘communalism’ and ‘communal violence’ are often used to analyse these riots. These tell us that the main cause behind the Hindu-Muslim conflicts in India is the use of religion for political ends. It is often added that religion itself is not responsible for the riots, but rather its misuse by power-hungry clerics and politicians. The harm of communalism lies in its mixing of political aims and religious identities, which is taken to cause violence. Let us have a closer look at this concept of communal violence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Dawkin’s  Delusion or The God Delusion?</title>
      <link>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/dawkins-delusion-or-the-god-delusion/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While re-reading certain passages from Richard Dawkins&amp;rsquo; The God Delusion (2006), I was so shocked by his combination of ignorance and arrogance. Forgive me for some Dawkins- bashing:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In a memorable passage, Dawkins discusses the problem of Trinitarianism in Christianity and extends it to other forms of &amp;ldquo;polytheism,&amp;rdquo; such as the cult of the Virgin Mary and the saints in Roman-Catholicism. &amp;ldquo;What impresses me about Catholic mythology,&amp;rdquo; he shares with the reader, &amp;ldquo;is partly its tasteless kitsch but mostly the airy nonchalance with which these people make up the details as they go along. It is just shamelessly invented&amp;rdquo; (Dawkins 2006: 35). As a reader, try to bracket away all presuppositions about religion and reread the sentences. If you succeed in doing so, the impact of Dawkins&amp;rsquo; claim dissolves. So what, if certain details of Roman-Catholicism are human inventions? What is the problem in aspects of religion being &amp;ldquo;shamelessly invented&amp;rdquo;? From a non-Christian, neutral point of view, it is unclear why Dawkins bothers to mention this. However, anyone with a basic understanding of the history of Christianity will note where his claim comes from: Dawkins himself reproduces a piece of theology in this sentence (apparently without knowing it). From its earliest beginnings, Christianity claimed that it was the original and pure revelation of God, first given to Adam. This original revelation had been corrupted by sinful idolaters, seduced by the Devil into the worship of the false god and his minions. This corruption, according to Christian theology, took the form of human additions to the pure divine revelation: rites and myths, fabricated by priests and prelates.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;During the Protestant Reformation, Luther, Calvin and their followers began to accuse the Roman-Catholic Church of the same sin of idolatry. They cried that the pope and his priests had invented a plethora of dogmas and rituals and imposed these on the believer as though they were part of God&amp;rsquo;s revelation and necessary to salvation. In this sense, the worst accusation one could make against Roman- Catholicism was that it consisted of &amp;ldquo;shameless human inventions.&amp;rdquo; The Enlightenment philosophes extended such charges of idolatry to all of Christianity and to all &amp;ldquo;religions&amp;rdquo; of humanity. All of these, including the notion of God itself, were human fabrications, the atheists among them claimed. Ironically, Enlightenment atheism thus presupposed and built on the claims of Christian theology. Without the background belief that there is something intrinsically wrong in religion being a human invention—very much a Christian belief—the impact of such charges simply disappears into thin air.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;People like Scott Atran and Sloan Wilson abuse evolutionary biology to produce ad hoc explanations of an explanandum whose truth they presuppose: the universality of religion. Their explanations are no better than those discussed by Balu in chapter 5 of &amp;lsquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://sites.google.com/site/colonialconsciousness/theheatheninhisblindness&#34;&gt;The Heathen in his blindness: Asia, the West and the dynamic of religion.&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;. Paraphrasing Balu, we may say that they consist of &amp;rsquo;two quarters of theology, a quarter of evolutionary biology and a quarter of illiterate ethnology&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Evolutionary explanations of religion: an exercise in petitio principii</title>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is very disappointing to see how these evolutionary theorists of religion lack knowledge of religions other than garden variety Judeo-Christianity (where they seem to have at least some factual knowledge, as in Scott Atran&amp;rsquo;s case, they reproduce standard textbook stories about Hinduism that have been left behind a few decades back).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If they did a serious study, it would perhaps strike them that no one has ever given either theoretical or empirical proof for the claim that religion is a human universal. From the 13th century onwards, European travelers, missionaries, merchants and scholars simply assumed that there would be religion in all societies. With this assumption in the background, they looked for the &amp;lsquo;beliefs&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;gods&amp;rsquo; of these societies. In the process, these western minds invented religions everywhere. Later scholars began to create all kinds of definitions of &amp;ldquo;religion&amp;rdquo; in order to accommodate their (cultural) intuition that religion is universal. As though a definition of a word can help us decide on the universality of a phenomenon. After all, we don&amp;rsquo;t use a definition of the word &amp;ldquo;gravitation&amp;rdquo; in order to find out whether gravitation exists on all planets, do we?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Secularized Christian theme: Hacker’s inclusivism and exclusivm</title>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When we consider  Paul Hacker&amp;rsquo;s story on &amp;lsquo;inclusivism as a typically Indian thought form&amp;rsquo;, all we can conclude is that he has used a &lt;em&gt;typically Christian  thought form&lt;/em&gt; to understand an aspect of the Indian cultural traditions, which he is unable to understand because it is completely different from what he knows. Hacker&amp;rsquo;s inclusivism is merely an attempt to strip the following Christian account from its recognizably Christian characteristics: &amp;ldquo;When God created man he inscribed him with a sense of divinity, and when it is &lt;em&gt;not corrupted&lt;/em&gt; this sense is the true religion. Throughout human history the devil and his minions corrupted this sense of divinity into false religion or worship of the devil among all human peoples. Until the good Lord brought mankind back to the true religion by revealing himself in Jesus Christ. Thus, Christianity is the one true religion. It is the message of self-disclosure in which God reveals his Will for the universe to the humankind. Of course, all other traditions contain traces of divine revelation, but these are nothing but the preparation of the Gospel. Once the true religion was revealed again, all non-Christian traditions could be nothing but pale and erring variants of Christianity.&amp;rdquo; Now Hacker has merely taken this Christian conceptual scheme to make sense of the attitude the Indian traditions take towards other traditions. Although it happens unconsciously most of the time, this is &lt;em&gt;the basic method of Indology&lt;/em&gt;: one looks at the Indian traditions, and the only way to make sense of them is to make them fit into a conceptual framework of secularized Christian theology.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, the European Parliament hosted a meeting on &amp;ldquo;caste discrimination in South Asia&amp;rdquo;. At the meeting, participants stated that &amp;ldquo;India is being ruled by castes not by laws&amp;rdquo; and that they demanded justice, because there &amp;ldquo;is one incredible India and one untouchable India.&amp;rdquo; The EU was urged to come out with a policy statement on the subject. One MEP, referring to the caste system, said that &amp;ldquo;this barbarism has to end.&amp;rdquo; This is not the first time. However, before the EU decides to publish policy statements on caste discrimination in India, we would do well to reflect on some simple facts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The sustained efforts by certain Hindu groups in the west to redefine and &amp;ldquo;correct&amp;rdquo; long existing Hindu traditions are perhaps reflective of their desire to put in place a cogent and structured religious system that is able to hold its own against other scripture-based religions. Concomitantly, American identity politics and European political correctness is also &amp;ldquo;forcing&amp;rdquo; minority communities to assert their separate &amp;ldquo;churches&amp;rdquo;, as a way of emphasising their own distinct religious or ethnic identity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On the Indian Debate and Its Western Origins&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The rise of Hindutva has often been interpreted as a threat to the secular state. Similarly, the recent outbursts of Hindu-Muslim conflict are said to be related to the decay of secularism. The author argues that the concept of secularism is fundamentally obscure, since it is founded upon an arbitrary distinction between the religious and the secular. The belief that religion should be separated from politics is a normative dogma that precedes all theoretical analysis of the Indian situation. Therefore, this concept of secularism prevents us from understanding the problems of pluralism in contemporary India, instead of helping us to solve them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Question of Conversion in India</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Indian debate on religious conversion has been an ongoing one for a few centuries now. However, the mutual understanding between the advocates and the adversaries of conversion has not advanced much. This paper suggests that this is due to the fact that Hindus and Christians refer to two different objects when they discuss &amp;lsquo;religion&amp;rsquo;. The traits which the Christians ascribe to religion account for the premium they put on the right to convert, while the traits of the Hindu view of religion explain the opposition to conversion. As the two parties attribute mutually exclusive properties to religion, they encounter difficulties while seeking to make sense of each other&amp;rsquo;s claims about religion and conversion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the last few decades, &amp;ldquo;secularism&amp;rdquo; has become the subject of caustic debate in the Indian media. The dispute about the value of this idea to contemporary India is no longer confined to the academic circles. Politicians, journalists and others have strong views on the topic. Secularism regularly surfaces in newspaper articles, speeches and public meetings. The critics of the idea, however, are not often taken seriously at the theoretical level. The proponents of secularism dismiss all objections against their pet idea as misguided. Critics are either considered to be naive obscurantists, who dream of a return to a romantic image of Indian traditional society; or they are condemned as Hindu fundamentalists, who resist modern secular values and strive for a Hindu religious state.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In years to come, the Indian community in the U.S. will face a major challenge from American pluralism. This is the first time a powerful community of pagans has to be accommodated within the American society. The NRI community is well-educated, well-to-do and proud of its cultural traditions. At the same time, the representation of the Indian traditions in the U.S. educational system shows a pathetic level of understanding. I will argue that recent events like the California textbook controversy point to a profound problem: &lt;em&gt;the American model of pluralism is unable to accommodate these pagan traditions&lt;/em&gt;. This is the case, because its structure has emerged from a co-existence of Protestant denominations. Maximally, the resulting model could encompass other variants of the religions of the book: Catholicism, Judaism and Islam. Incorporating the pagan traditions of India, however, will require a fundamental rethinking of American pluralism.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Towards a positive portrayal of Hindu traditions?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What is at stake in the California textbook controversy? Few would agree that it concerns only the image of Hinduism as offered to the pupils of the California state schools. The controversy involves much more than that alone. It is the next phase in the NRI community&amp;rsquo;s struggle for a less biased and more benign portrayal of Hinduism in the educational system and in American society in general. In the last three years many similar incidents have occurred: the acrimonious debate about &amp;lsquo;Wendy&amp;rsquo;s Child Syndrome&amp;rsquo;; the Kripal and Courtright controversies; the indignation about the depiction of Hindu deities on bikini&amp;rsquo;s, slippers and toilet seats; etc. These transient outbursts express a solid and growing concern about the derogatory conceptions of the Hindu traditions, which still dominate the western societies and academia. In very general terms, the aim of this struggle could be put as follows: to make the world aware of the positive contributions the Indian culture and its traditions have made and can make to humanity. Since this is an aim I share, I would like to assess the NRI community&amp;rsquo;s progress towards its realization. This evaluation will take the California textbook controversy as a reference point, while addressing some of the broader issues involved.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Christian Attitudes and The Rule of Law as the Mechanism of Secularization </title>
      <link>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/law-secularization-and-religious-attitudes/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/law-secularization-and-religious-attitudes/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;So far, our answers have always taken this form: in the moment of secularization, the formal structures or cognitive schemes of Christianity are diffused accordingly as they lose their specific doctrinal content. In this formulation, it is as though the logical form of religion is able to spread itself by disposing of its semantic content. Thus, both the common sense of the West and the scholarly consensus of the academia accept the background assumptions of Christian doctrine, while they do not adopt its specific teachings. Balu has always been somewhat unhappy about this formulation. As he argues in &lt;a href=&#34;http://sites.google.com/site/colonialconsciousness/theheatheninhisblindness&#34;&gt;chapter 11 of `The Heathen in his blindness: Asia, the West and the dynamic of religion&amp;rsquo;&lt;/a&gt;, it is not a specific set of assumptions which spreads in society, but rather certain attitudes. The claims about the universality of religion, the meaning of life, the necessity of norms, the superiority of liberal democracy, etc. do not generally appear as explicit premises held by a group of people. Then, it seems the only explanation one can give is to ascribe them to these people as implicit assumptions. To some extent, this works: theories about the origin of religion, or the nature of morality, or human psychology all presuppose that certain assumptions are true. So if one intends to reveal the conceptual problems of these theories, it is fruitful to analyze these assumptions as the hidden premises of theorizing.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, when it comes to explaining how the Christian religion spreads in a secular form, these accounts are unconvincing. What happens? Do the implicit assumptions or formalized theological schemes expand their scope as a kind of unit ideas by jumping from mind to mind? In what realm do these assumptions and background frameworks exist and procreate? The problem becomes acute when we turn to the spread of secularized Christianity in pagan societies like the Indian. Do the elite of alienated intellectuals suddenly adopt these assumptions as the starting points of reasoning about politics and society? Do they spread automatically from the colonized elite to other layers of Indian society, because this is a basic dynamic of societies? Such answers would be unsatisfactory. But what then is the mechanism through which secularized religious schemes spread and structure the experience of an ever increasing number of individuals? This and other related questions have been bothering me for some time (not least because I have failed to solve any of them in my doctoral thesis).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We have developed partial explanations of why the secularism debate in India takes such peculiar forms and why otherwise intelligent people talk nonsense here. But we don&amp;rsquo;t do so by pegging our use of the word secularism &amp;ldquo;onto Balu&amp;rsquo;s theory about the nature of religion and how that entity religion behaves in the world&amp;rdquo; and then expecting that other people do the same.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let me quickly repeat our argument: Concepts like religion and secularism and principles of the secular state developed in Europe against the background of larger conceptual frameworks. Broadly speaking, one knew what &lt;code&gt;religion&#39; and &#39;the secular state&#39; referred to or what the separation of &lt;/code&gt;the religious&amp;rsquo; and `the political&amp;rsquo; amounted to, because these terms were embedded in such a common background framework. Naturally, there were many different positions and discontinuities in the debates. But disagreements about the precise meaning of terms or clashes between conflicting normative positions made sense to the participants, precisely because they occurred against the background of this type of framework. The framework put semantic limits on the potential interpretation of terms and principles, as it related concepts to each other in particular systematic ways. This background framework reflects not only generic Christian theology and political theory, but also the common cultural and historical experience of Europeans.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Indian Americans and Identity Politics</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We do not have any clear explanation of the nature and rise of American identity politics as yet. But here are a few speculative intuitions:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Identity politics seems to be the way in which the dominant culture in America compels other cultural communities to become variants of itself. It sustains a basic model of society which neutralizes groups that challenge the dominant culture by making them into cultural ghettos. As such, these groups can demand recognition of their distinct identity and fight for a just representation in education. But they can do so only within the conceptual limits fixed by the dominant culture. In this way, the other cultural communities are straitjacketed into the basic cultural structure of American society. This basic structure somehow reflects the mechanisms through which Christianity has always transformed the nonwestern cultures into variants of itself. As such, American society and its identity politics are secularized Christianity embodied in a socio-political model.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The absence of supernatural entities in Indian traditions</title>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The absence of supernatural entities in the Indian traditions may seem counterintuitive to many. We can let someone else do the talking for us, namely Dale B. Martin in his interesting book &lt;em&gt;Inventing Superstition: from the Hippocratics to the Christians&lt;/em&gt; (Harvard University Press, 2004):&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;One of the basic arguments of this book is that, contrary to many modern assumptions, the category of &amp;ldquo;the supernatural&amp;rdquo; did not exist in ancient culture &lt;em&gt;as&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;a category&lt;/em&gt;. Neither popular notions, held by the vast majority of inhabitants of the ancient world, nor philosophical notions (we could say &amp;ldquo;scientific&amp;rdquo; with due consideration for the possible anachronistic connotations of the term) assumed that reality was split up into two realms, one &amp;ldquo;natural,&amp;rdquo; containing things like &amp;ldquo;matter&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;natural forces&amp;rdquo; such as gravity or electricity, and another &amp;ldquo;supernatural,&amp;rdquo; to which gods and similar beings (demigods, angels, demons, ghosts) could be assigned&amp;hellip; What is important for this post is that the category was not available, either explicitly or by assumption, for persons in the classical Greek and Roman worlds. The Greeks and Romans certainly had no &lt;em&gt;word&lt;/em&gt; that was equivalent to the modern English &amp;ldquo;supernatural.&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip;I do not, however, want just to quibble about words. Classical Greeks and Latin had not term for what passes in the modern world as &amp;ldquo;the supernatural&amp;rdquo; precisely because the ancients did not separate out divine forces and beings from &amp;ldquo;nature&amp;rdquo; and relegate them to a separate ontological realm that could designated by its own label. Generally, for ancient people whatever does exist exists in &amp;ldquo;nature.&amp;rdquo; Almost without exception the Greek term &lt;em&gt;physis&lt;/em&gt; (nature) refers to &amp;ldquo;all that is.&amp;rdquo; People might argue that the gods did not exist or that some particular daimon or god or superhuman being did not exist (I know of no ancient author who argued for actual atheism in the modern sense). But in that case, they said that the disputed entity simply did not exist, not that it might exist in some other realm of reality, such as the &amp;ldquo;supernatural.&amp;rdquo; Ancient philosophers might argue that lightning was not caused by a god, but they did not do so by pointing out that lightning occurs in the &amp;ldquo;natural&amp;rdquo; realm and that the gods exist in the &amp;ldquo;supernatural&amp;rdquo; realm and that the two realms are not supposed to interact with one another. Ancient people took the gods and all other beings we would think of as &amp;ldquo;supernatural&amp;rdquo; to be &lt;em&gt;part&lt;/em&gt; of nature if they existed at all.&amp;rdquo; (pp. 13-15)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Fallacy of Equivocation: Indian Secularism</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While reading Shabnum Tejani&amp;rsquo;s *Indian Secularism: A Social and Intellectual History (*2008), I ran into the same weird point that Neera Chandhoke also tried to make at the RRI platform debate on secularism. This is a combination of the old claim that &amp;lsquo;secularism&amp;rsquo; has acquired a different meaning in India and a general theoretical point: &amp;lsquo;secularism does not have any essence or universal meaning, but gets different meanings dependent on the historical and cultural contexts in which it has developed&amp;rsquo;. There are different variations on this formulation, but the general point is one that is becoming increasingly popular (especially among historians), because of the influence of Talal Asad and other postmodernators. Hence, I wanted to try and address the point by taking the example of Tejani&amp;rsquo;s work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Atheism: a secularized theism—Jakob de Roover</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;1: Atheism is a phenomenon that came into being in the western culture at around the time of the so-called Enlightenment. The West claims that it liberated itself from the dogmas of the Christian religion in this Enlightenment, and those who call themselves atheists mean by this that they belong to the enlightened people who &amp;ldquo;have escaped from the dogmatic illusions of religion.&amp;rdquo; Now, as it has always done, Christian Europe simply identified its own history with human history in general, and it claimed that all cultures had so far been under the ignorant spell of religion, but that they could now be liberated by the Enlightened West. This claim needs two separate premises: (a) That all cultures have religion (b) That atheism was a new and rational system of beliefs that could liberate people from all cultures from this illusion of religion.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What makes Christianity a religion? The structure of Christianity as a religion</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The logical steps that &lt;em&gt;inevitably&lt;/em&gt; make the claim that God revealed His Will in Jesus Christ into an unconditional and exclusive truth claim are fairly simple:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(a) Christianity says that the universe was created by God, and that this universe is the perfect embodiment of His will or plan;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(b) Furthermore, it claims that this God has revealed His Will to humankind, and that this revelation is the Christian doctrine as it is &amp;rsquo;embodied&amp;rsquo; in Jesus Christ;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Secularized Christian Belief: Religion is a cultural/human universal</title>
      <link>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/secularized-christian-belief-religion-is-a-culturalhuman-universal/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of these so-called secular accounts that are in fact Christian is the belief that all cultures have a religion. It is simply a secularization of the Christian belief that the biblical God gave religion to humankind, which was transformed into the assumption that religion is a cultural universal during the Enlightenment. This pre-theoretical assumption precedes all empirical research and theory-formation on religion and culture. From the early missionaries to the contemporary anthropologists, no one has ever even doubted that the phenomenon of religion is universal to all cultures. All psychological and sociological and even biological and neurological explanations of religion take this pre-theoretical Christian theological assumption as a starting point. Now, this is hardly scientific, isn&amp;rsquo;t it? In &lt;a href=&#34;http://sites.google.com/site/colonialconsciousness/theheatheninhisblindness&#34;&gt;his book &amp;lsquo;The Heathen in His Blindness: Asia, the West and the dynamic of religion&amp;rsquo;&lt;/a&gt;, Balagangadhara shows that the belief that all cultures have religion has more to do with the structure of the Christian religion than with the nature of human cultures. Furthermore, he develops a theory of religion which reveals that Christianity, Islam, and Judaism are at present the only instances of the phenomenon of religion. On top of that, he shows why those belonging to these religions and to the cultures they have created, are deeply inclined to believe that all human cultures must have a religion or at least a world view. The latter belief in the universality of religion is not a scientific hypothesis at all, but a religious doctrine. He also shows that the pagan traditions have a structure that is completely different from that of these three religions. In other words, the semitic religions and the pagan traditions are not variants of the same supposedly universal phenomenon of religion, rather they are &lt;strong&gt;different phenomena&lt;/strong&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;</description>
