This <strong>book</strong>  tries to answer a question that is also its title. This book shares some of the results of 40 years of research in the Research Programme Comparative Science of Cultures. It plots the outlines of the differences that distinguish one culture from another, Indian and western in our case. The narrative does not track differences between nations, societies or religions but investigates domains like experience, sense of the past and constructions of the self to sketch a possible answer to the question. The book straddles the fields of social sciences and humanities to tackle issues of knowledge about culture and exhibits the relevance of these areas of enquiry to us all. It suggests an alternative to the ruling orthodoxies that constitute ‘identity politics’ today while showing that this label hides more content than even what their best proponents imagine.
<strong>Written in a non-academic language and an accessible style</strong>, the book addresses an intelligent but lay public. Consequently, it contains neither many citations nor any references. However, what it conveys is based on a scientific research programme, whose results are published in scientific journals and research monographs. It also formulates interesting hypotheses currently under investigation.
Today the question <em>What does it mean to be ‘Indian’?</em> faces difficulty. Is it a motto like ‘E Pluribus Unum’ or ‘satyameva jayate’? Is it a ‘colourful’ and ‘beautiful’ culture where people wear bindis, deck themselves in Kanchipuram Silk and do puja? Is it a question of national borders and territories? Or is it an institutional question: about educational institutions, courts of law, a huge parliament or even being the world’s ‘largest’ democracy? Do we belong to a culture of oppression, exploitation and conflict or do we aspire to draw the divine nectar by churning the ocean? Is there something ‘Indian’ about our culture that goes beyond the differences between Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs or Jains? What does it <em>überhaupt</em> mean to belong to Indian culture?
<strong>Why ask this question today?</strong> Do we not know the answers? After all, as we know, a lot is written about India, her culture, her past, her society, the psychology and sociology of individuals and their groups. Why is that not enough to answer the query about what it means to be ‘Indian’?
It is because what we have learnt about ourselves so far is either false or very fragmentary. Whether one claims that India is a class society or a caste society or a combination of both, one is not saying much. Such a claim merely tells us that India too has a society and that it either fully or partially mirrors other societies and people one way or another. Our question is not whether we are also human beings, whether we also have a social and cultural life, but <em>what kind of people we are, where we are coming from and where should we head as a society, as a culture and as individuals</em>. Thus, we ask: what does it mean to be ‘Indian’?
In answering this question, this book <strong>transcends the distinction between ‘the right’ and ‘the left’ by looking deeper into ideas of human beings, society, culture, experience, past</strong> and other related clusters. One such element is the colonial past of India which is of relevance not merely to the colonised but to the coloniser as well. It is through the British that India is drawn into western culture, transforming both herself and the West in the process. In outlining its contours, the book shows why its question is relevant not just to the citizens of a country or to members of a culture but to all of us who consider ourselves human beings.
Indian intellectuals have vacillated between virtue-signalling and moral indignation; they have completely given up all intellectual questions and responsibilities. This has resulted in a large, <strong>intelligent and educated populace that is hungry for insights that make sense of their world</strong>. This group, in India (and abroad), is fed up with being told that they ought to be ashamed of being Indian, of belonging to the &rsquo;third world&rsquo; and are no longer convinced that they ought to become as western as quickly as possible. Their numbers are growing by the day. This group ranges from the Millennials entering their thirties to the young retirees entering their sixties. This is the first generation of the middle class, which emerged in the 80s and 90s. These Millennials who grew up believing themselves to be ‘global citizens’ are now confronted with the inadequacy of the stories they have. <em><strong>‘What does it mean to be an Indian, in the 21st century?’</strong></em> is a question they are confronting as an actuality with real-world implications. This is a question raised at the level of culture and can only be answered at that level. Neither nationalism nor identity-politics are satisfactory.
This book is sui generis and fills a lacuna that few have identified, let alone addressed. If Asian culture is not simply a slightly inferior, slightly idiosyncratic variant of European culture, as we have been told for a very long time, what else is it? Hence, the corollary question: What does it mean to be an Indian? The author can ask and answer this question because he has theorised on a larger question in his four decades of research: <strong>What makes a difference, any difference, into a cultural difference and not a social, psychological or biological difference?</strong> As of today, there is no competition. There are books that slice the question in old and familiar ways: religion, politics, spirituality, sociology etc. These familiar stories in their various permutations and combinations have not only grown stale but are demonstrably useless.</p>

      <p><strong>1</strong>. In this talk, I would like to focus on the two attitudes that I have towards your project. It is not that I have ambiguous feelings; no, I have two distinct feelings. On the one hand, I am convinced that you will not reach your goal because such a goal is unreachable. Not only that. Your goal is undesirable and best abandoned. On the other hand, if you strive with integrity, clarity and passion to reach your goal, in the process, you will achieve results that are desirable, necessary and important. So, I would like to support and encourage your project. On the one hand, I believe that I can develop a few impossibility arguments that will show why you best abandon your project; on the other hand, I have given no thought to developing such a set of arguments because I want you to work further towards your goal so that you produce the results that we, as humankind, need. This might suggest that I am ambiguous toward your project, but, as I said, I am not. To explain thus attitude better, let me use an illustration from the history of philosophy (albeit in a slightly caricatured form),</p>

<p>Edward Said is dead. Last Wednesday he lost his battle with cancer. The influence of this Palestinian writer in all areas of the social sciences of the last quarter century is immense. Many will remember him from Delhi to Dar Es Salaam, from Paris to Chicago; many will also write in memoriams.</p>

      <p>There are multiple kinds of interpretation. For instance, there is interpretation of symbols in a domain like Physics: μ (in elementary optics) is &ldquo;interpreted&rdquo; as the refraction index of a substance. We use a more or less analogous notion of &ldquo;interpretation&rdquo; in Chemistry, Mathematics and so on. In logic, we speak of &ldquo;interpretation of variables&rdquo; like <em>p</em>, <em>q</em>, etc. Here, it means that the letters stand-in for arbitrary sentences with truth-values.</p>

      <p>The western intellectual tradition has bemoaned the fact that the Indians never indulged in history-writing (or historiography). In this tradition, there is an obsessive need for collecting &ldquo;facts&rdquo; about the past. This is partly the result of how Judaism, Christianity and Islam (the three Semitic religions) look at themselves and their own past: everything they claim about their past (the Flood, the temple of Solomon, the coming of Christ, etc.) should not only be true but proven so beyond all doubt. They have to be true (in the sense that their recounting of the past should also be confirmed by research) because these religions live or die accordingly as whether it is also true what they say effectively happened on earth. These facts (like the existence of, say, the Temple of Solomon in the Israel of today and the Judea of yesterday or the existence of Jesus of Nazareth), in their turn, prove the truth about Moses and his tablet and the truth of the promise of God to the children of Israel. If the recounting of their past turns out to be false (like, say, the absence of any of the above two) would destroy their existence: if there was never a historical Jesus of Nazareth, Christianity would collapse like a house of cards. (In fact, Julian the Apostate, the nephew of the Emperor Constantine, set out to rebuild the Temple of Solomon at its original site precisely in order to do this. His early death, viewed both by the Jews and the Christians as an act of God, put an end to this project.)</p>

      <p>Two caveats. One: the commentary is very, very short. To write down all the things I want to say about this citation requires a long paper and not a brief mail. Two: I have not checked either the citation or the reference (Brihadaranyaka upanishad - I.iv.10). I assume that both are accurate.</p>

Would you be able to guide this student in answering his question or give one answer to it? Your answer would be: it depends. You would also further say to him, ‘choose a particular disease, choose a particular domain and choose a particular approach within that domain, if you want to do research’. There is no ‘one answer’ to his question.

      <p>You say that you experienced Shakti as an emanation of a force that is overpowering and palpable; you also say that you felt the ‘presence’ of Shakti strongly. These two sentences make one think that you felt the presence of the force. In that case, there are only two routes open to us: (a) either reject that we have knowledge of the world which forbids linguistic utterances from infusing material objects with ‘life’ forces that can have causal impact in the world; (b) or ‘downgrade’ science as knowledge of the world by allowing ‘spiritual’ (or supra-mundane) worlds to causally interact with the ‘physical’ world. Your own process of thinking about this experience is rigidly hemmed in by these alternatives. Neither, I think, is what you are seeking. If you are, you cannot and will not find what you seek, even if it is to merely figure out your experience.</p>

<p>Actually I&rsquo;m the odd man out. We have success stories. We have spiritual leaders; we have an extraordinarily organizational leader in front of us. And now I have to do an exam. You see, normally I take exams in the university. Now I have to do an exam. The exam is this I must move you from these wonderful stories, success stories, good stories, to a rather depressing story. The question is how can I do it and still catch your attention. I don&rsquo;t know. After the exam, tell me please whether I&rsquo;ve succeeded or failed.</p>

      <p>It is advisable to get into a discussion about this question only after one knows what ‘supererogation’ means and how it has been discussed for centuries.  In the Greek ethics (especially as Aristotle formulated it), the notion plays a very crucial role without it being related to a normative sense of duty. With the Catholics, especially as Aquinas gave expression to it, a normative notion of duty cohabits the moral universe together with supererogation. To the Protestants, it makes sense to speak only of duty and not of supererogation because the latter does not simply exist. Without understanding the issues involved in these controversies, to make a bald assertion about supererogation (while appealing to a Protestant commonsense idea of duty without even realizing its Protestant origin) is to “…rush in, where Angels fear to tread”.</p>

      <p>When you provide a moral criticism of someone, you are saying that such a person is morally wrong. If you bracket, for a moment, my writings and talks on the subject, then you see that no moral criticisms are possible without using a normative language.</p>
<p>About realizing moral ideals: do you know any way of showing how some or another event in the world is not an &lsquo;imperfect&rsquo; realization of the relevant moral ideal? In fact, a reasonably capable intellectual acrobat could show that Nazism or Idi Amin&rsquo;s Uganda were merely &lsquo;imperfect&rsquo; moral realizations of United Nations Declaration of Human Rights or that they did &lsquo;realize&rsquo; the moral ideals albeit in an &lsquo;imperfect&rsquo; manner. The problem is this: we cannot put limiting conditions on the degrees of imperfection unless one compares. Even that is quite problematic: is the US, with the NSA surveillance of its citizens, less or more &lsquo;imperfect&rsquo; than France, which very recently demanded the introduction of fingerprinting (and other biometric identifications ) for EU citizens traveling within the EU countries?  With the vast array of CCTV&rsquo;s monitoring its streets, is UK, previously the home of Locke and Mill, any less or any more the &rsquo;land of freedom&rsquo; it was and is alleged to be? Is it an &lsquo;imperfect&rsquo; realization or a severe deformation of the relevant moral ideals?  The only real and practical use of the normative ethical theories appear to be: justify any immoral behavior as an &lsquo;imperfect&rsquo; realization of a noble moral ideal.</p>

      <p>(a) Paolo Friere, a Brazilian educationalist, has spoken about such a phenomenon at length in his <em>Pedagogy of the Oppressed</em>. He calls it as an ‘internalisation of the oppressor by the oppressed’. Whether we use Paolo Friere’s terminology or the much later one of ‘Stockholm Syndrome’, the problem is the same: both <em>name</em> the phenomenon without <em>explaining it</em>. In and of itself, not such a big problem if it is not for a cognitive tendency that is <strong>dominant</strong> in the ‘social sciences’, which brings me to the second point.</p>

<p>Perhaps, one of the ways to test whether your search is taking you in the right direction is by seeing whether it solves a well-known paradox, or explicates it in a novel way. If after research, your hypothesis leads you to a well-known discussion in theology (but <em>lacks</em> the latter&rsquo;s sophistication), then you could be on an uninteresting track.</p>

<p>In certain phases of thinking, unbridled speculations have a serious contribution to make. After some time, it teaches one that there is a very interesting difference between <a href="/hipkapi/posts/arguments-vs-theories/">disciplined speculations and speculations of other sorts</a>
 and that one has to learn the former. However, the only way to learn the former is through the latter.</p>

<p>Let us suppose that some school or another in India also prescribes uniform to its students. A Sikh boy and a Muslim girl enroll. They wear the colors of the school, including the right colored turban (or, if the Sikh kid is too young, his hair tied up in a knot) and the right-colored head scarf. From what I know of the Indian schools, most schools (including the fellow-students) would let the situation stand. Assume that some school makes an issue about this. The parents do not have many choices: either the Sikh family shaves the boy (unlikely), or step to the courts (more likely today than yesterday) or look for another school (most likely) if persuading the school authorities fails. If we look at the tolerance of the school authorities, it appears to me that the following can be said: in all probability, it does not occur to them that, in keeping the turban or the head scarf on, the kids are marking themselves off or that there is discrimination involved in allowing this. The question is: how do they look at the turban (or the tied knot of hair) or at the scarf?</p>

<p>We can all accept the fact, I suppose, that some thing or another is a religious symbol to someone when s/he belongs to that religion whose symbol it is. In this sense, the Cross (for a long period of time), the figure of the Prophet Mohammed (also for a long period of time) and the star of David (in the course of this century) are symbols that carry religious significance to the Christians, Muslims and the Jews respectively. We are also agreed, I suppose, that there is no way of characterizing any of these as religious symbols in a religiously neutral way.</p>

      <blockquote>
<p>It would be interesting to answer the question of whether or not The Lord of the Rings (LOTR) is a religious story by testing against &lsquo;religion is an explanatorily intelligible account of the Cosmos&rsquo;. Does the Lord of the Rings give an account in which the causal and intentional explanations for the happenings in Middle Earth fall together?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the problems in testing a scientific theory and of developing one, I might add, is to ask the right question. The other problem, of course, is to find the right answer. Let us first take a step back and look at the claim.</p>

      <p>I keep teaching my students the need to unlearn: unlearn the desire to &lsquo;show off&rsquo; their erudition; unlearn shallowness and so on. I am more than convinced that whatever we have learnt about human beings can be formulated in a jargon-free language and in a simple manner. There is no need to appear &lsquo;mysterious and profound&rsquo;; nor is there a need for exhibiting one&rsquo;s erudition or &lsquo;critical capacities&rsquo;. On all these counts, most of Foucalt&rsquo;s writings (and that of his commentators) can only call forth anger and irritation.</p>
