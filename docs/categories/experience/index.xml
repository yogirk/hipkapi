      <title>Experience and truth</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Of course, you can use Kant (or anyone other philosopher of your liking) to talk about what experience is. But if you use these thinkers (of the last 1000 years or so) to think about experience, you will be trapped in a set of problems: (a) you will have to talk about sensory input (no matter what technical term you use here), which cognition works on; (b) the world as something that provides these inputs; (c) distinguishing subjectivity and objectivity of the perception of the world accordingly and so on. Ultimately, truth becomes the final arbiter of everything.&#xA;In contrast stands Indian thinking that talks about ‘forms’ (Rupa, Rasa, Sparsha, Sabda, Gandha etc) that interact with our abilities (that includes cognition as a part) and about how this world of forms interacts with us. This leads to our notion(s) of experience. In this case, we do not talk about indoctrination but about learning and changing the processes of learning.&#xA;I have decided to take the second route because it helps me find solutions to problems. The first route blocks even the noticing that there are problems.&#xA;Of course, I have not yet written out even the outlines of the second route, whereas the first has many champions over the last 500 years. To outline the second route absorbing what cognitive sciences and multiple psychologies (not to speak of biology) tell us about ourselves is a huge undertaking, which I cannot possibly complete before I die. Yet.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How about speaking the truth about reservations?</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/hipkapi/posts/how-about-speaking-the-truth-about-reservations/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happens to the future of Indian intellectual scene when most of projects driven by its intelligentsia propagate perverted truths for self-seeking purposes?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Satyam Vada, Dharmam Chara”, “Satyameva Jayate”&lt;/em&gt; are but two of the well-known Sanskrit sayings that are supposed to indicate the values placed upon truth and truth-telling in Indian culture.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It comes as a surprise, therefore, to read three items in the newspaper and a comment on a blog which seem to follow ‘truth’. But in such a way that &lt;em&gt;it becomes perverse&lt;/em&gt;. Because all the four issues are important, I would like to briefly talk about each.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How to access Indian traditions?</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/hipkapi/posts/how-to-access-indian-traditions/</link>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I have often said, the most intriguing aspect of the Indian culture is the kind of knowledge it produced and encouraged people to produce: experiential knowledge which emerges by systematically reflecting on our (human) experiences in the world. As human beings, our experiences are many: no one set, no one kind of experience exhausts what we go through. From the purely personal experiences of the world (our ambitions, hopes, dreams, frustrations, etc) to the entirely social ones (the experiences of sorrow and injustice that other human beings in the world experience). So, knowledge that reflects on or thinks about and systematizes such experiences presupposes multiple learning sites, many diverse perspectives and varied kinds of intellectual skills.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Is Maya an Illusion? Nonsense sold by Scholars!</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;According to your account, Vedanta claims that the &lt;em&gt;world is an illusion&lt;/em&gt; and that only the Brahman is real.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the world is an illusion, Vedanta has to deny the reality of the world. To it, in the way you construe Vedanta, the world &lt;em&gt;is the empty set&lt;/em&gt;. That is to say, all experiences are on par because they are all illusions. One cannot distinguish between experiences unless one introduces the notion of a differentiated reality. From this, it follows that a vedantin should not be able to discriminate, say, between the following: the pain you have by stubbing your toe, the pain you have when your arm is cut off without anaesthesia, and the pain you feel when your loved one dies. If he does draw a distinction between them, he is distinguishing one illusion from the other and the only way of doing that is to ascribe to these illusions the status of reality: this is &amp;rsquo;less illusory&amp;rsquo; than… this is &amp;lsquo;more real&amp;rsquo; than… this &amp;lsquo;pains more than&amp;rsquo;… this pain is &amp;lsquo;different from&amp;rsquo;…and so on. If he does not distinguish, and insists there is no difference between falling in a lake and bumping his head against a tree, who would take him seriously? Do you believe that Indians are such cretins that they would simply accept such inane stories? Surely, if &amp;lsquo;Brahman&amp;rsquo; is all there is to Vedanta, all vedantins must be perfect imbeciles. In that case, we do not need heavy-duty tantric stuff to shoot them down; a simple dose of commonsense will do.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Achievements of Indology: Esoteric Indian traditions</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A science of cultures is not Atmagyaana or Brahmagyaana. Let me also add that I find a quest for happiness a normal human striving.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;According to the Indian traditions, experience itself is a state of being: anubhava. In my story, so is happiness (or atmasaakshaatkaara). Need one be enlightened in order to speak about enlightenment? Should that be the case, one cannot strive for enlightenment at all and I think that enlightenment (or happiness) is a legitimate goal for human beings. If happiness is not an esoteric state of being but a legitimate goal for all human beings, there are indefinitely many roads to that state of being. The strength of the Indian traditions lies not merely in recognizing this but also in working out many such routes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What is Anubhava? III</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/hipkapi/posts/what-is-anubhava-iv/</link>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let us retain the translation of &amp;lsquo;Anu&amp;rsquo; as &amp;lsquo;appropriate&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;apt&amp;rsquo;. Let us emphasize the active dimension of the word &amp;lsquo;Bhava&amp;rsquo; to translate it as &amp;lsquo;coming into existence&amp;rsquo;. (&amp;lsquo;Existence&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;being&amp;rsquo; are also acceptable translations of the word &amp;lsquo;Bhava&amp;rsquo;.) Then &amp;lsquo;Anubhava&amp;rsquo; would mean an apt way of coming-into-existence. The problem here is this: we can ask the question, &lt;em&gt;coming into existence of what?&lt;/em&gt; Of course, we can answer it easily by using hyphenation: it is not the coming-into-existence of any &amp;rsquo;thing&amp;rsquo; but coming-into &amp;rsquo;existence&amp;rsquo;. However, this might create more confusion than it solves. So, let us make a compromise here for the sake of clarity: coming-into-existence-of-being. We can also shorten it as coming-into-being, where we understand &amp;lsquo;being&amp;rsquo; as &amp;lsquo;origin&amp;rsquo;. We come into existence, we originate. In this sense, &amp;lsquo;Anubhava&amp;rsquo; talks about &amp;ldquo;an appropriate originating&amp;rdquo;. (This is all heavy-duty philosophy stuff, this is what &amp;lsquo;ontology&amp;rsquo; is, the &amp;lsquo;doctrine of being&amp;rsquo;.) As long as we keep these ideas in mind, we can say that &amp;lsquo;bhava&amp;rsquo; can be translated also as &amp;lsquo;being-there-in the world&amp;rsquo;, or as &amp;lsquo;being present in the world&amp;rsquo;. Thus, &amp;lsquo;anubhava&amp;rsquo;, or experience, is &amp;lsquo;being appropriately present in the world&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;being aptly present in the world&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What is experience? I</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/hipkapi/posts/what-is-experience-iii/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 17 Mar 2011 01:33:01 +0530</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/hipkapi/posts/what-is-experience-iii/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The biggest issue is: what is experience? All the Indian traditions have been busy with answering this question. But both posing this question and answering it are themselves experiential, as far as the Indian traditions are concerned. For instance, according to the so-called Buddhist traditions, the structures-in-experience are not given in the experience itself: the impermanence and transience of experience has to do with the realization that the description of the experience provides a sense of permanence because all descriptions of experience &amp;lsquo;create&amp;rsquo; structures. Here, it has to do with structures like &amp;lsquo;self&amp;rsquo;, specific emotions, and such like. But that does not mean that the Buddhist tradition says that our &amp;rsquo;experience&amp;rsquo; of a tree, or a stone or a car, etc. is illusory. That is, they do not say that the &amp;rsquo;experience&amp;rsquo; of the external world is an illusion.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If we take our English language use as a reference point, it appears as though we can speak sensibly about experiencing our feelings (&amp;lsquo;I experience sadness&amp;rsquo;), experiencing thoughts (&amp;lsquo;I can even now experience my jumbled thoughts when &amp;hellip;&amp;rsquo;), experiencing colour (&amp;lsquo;I experience a redness&amp;rsquo;), experiencing actions (&amp;lsquo;I still experience my shaking limbs when I&amp;hellip;&amp;rsquo;) and so on. That is, we can experience the &amp;lsquo;inputs&amp;rsquo; of all our five senses. From this, it follows that experience &lt;em&gt;cannot be&lt;/em&gt; identical to any of them. Experience might contain, as its elements, inputs from these five senses in the form of thoughts, feelings, sensations, etc. but it cannot be coextensive with any one of them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What is experience? II</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/hipkapi/posts/what-is-experience-i/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;1.1. Let us begin with the word &amp;ldquo;Anubhava&amp;rdquo;, which we use to translate the English word &amp;ldquo;experience&amp;rdquo;. There are two sub-words here: Anu and Bhava. &amp;lsquo;Anu&amp;rsquo; can be translated as &amp;lsquo;apt&amp;rsquo;, or &amp;lsquo;appropriate&amp;rsquo;, whereas &amp;lsquo;Bhava&amp;rsquo; can be rendered as &amp;rsquo;existence&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;being&amp;rsquo;. (The word also has an active dimension of &amp;lsquo;becoming&amp;rsquo; as one of its meanings.) So, &amp;lsquo;anubhava&amp;rsquo; would mean having an appropriate existence or even an appropriate way of being-in-the-world. Appropriate to what though? Appropriate to the things, events, and the people one meets in the world. So, &amp;rsquo;experience&amp;rsquo; means a way of being present in the world that is appropriate to whatever one encounters in the world. It is, if you like, &amp;lsquo;being-present-with&amp;rsquo;. This means that we need time: to discover ways that are appropriate to the different things we relate to in the world, we have to take our time to get to know them. That is to say, if one wants to experience the world, one has to take the time, have patience and be there. In short, &amp;rsquo;experience&amp;rsquo; indicates a stance or an attitude we assume in the world with respect to whatever we encounter (think, taste, perceive, hear, feel, touch) in the world. Experience, thus, includes sensations, perceptions, feelings, thoughts etc but is not co-extensive with any of them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Introspection vs. reflection on experience—S.N.Balagangadhara</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/hipkapi/posts/introspection-vs-reflection-upon-experience-s-n-balagangadhara/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this post, I want to reflect on what it means &lt;em&gt;to access and think&lt;/em&gt; about experience. Perhaps, not so much on what these words mean but what is entailed by (or what happens when we indulge in) this kind of activity. I think the best way to begin this analysis is by asking the following two questions about an activity familiar to most of us: what do we do when we think about ourselves? Do we do it the &amp;lsquo;right&amp;rsquo; way? Let me begin with the first question and postpone looking at the second for a later stage, including how we should understand it. Because most of us know how we think about ourselves most of the times, I will take a trivial example and skip over certain explanations and analyses. The holes in my reasoning can either be filled by our memories or by discussing them at a later stage.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
