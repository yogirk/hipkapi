<li>He says: &ldquo;Doniger translates &ldquo;dharma&rdquo; as &ldquo;religion&rdquo;. Apparently, Indians should not criticize that because we know neither what the English word &ldquo;religion&rdquo; means nor do we know what &ldquo;dharma&rdquo; means because neither English nor Sanskrit is our mother tongue.&rdquo;
First of all I do not say or imply that Indians <em>should not criticize</em> the translation. I merely point out that (a) there is indeterminacy in translation across two languages and <em>therefore</em> (b) we can only make &lsquo;qualitative&rsquo; criticisms. That is to say, one must suggest <em>how</em> the word &ldquo;Dharma&rdquo; should be translated in all those different contexts that Doniger translates it as &ldquo;Religion&rdquo;. Otherwise, the criticism (&ldquo;that it is not an &lsquo;accurate&rsquo; translation&rdquo;) is bogus.
Secondly, I did not say nor imply that we<em>do not know</em> the meaning of &ldquo;religion&rdquo; or &ldquo;dharma&rdquo;. That is, I did not claim that these two words are just as intelligible to us as the words &lsquo;pif-paf&rsquo; and &lsquo;paf-paf&rsquo;.</li>
<li>He further says: &ldquo;We may have the word dharma in Hindi but it may mean something different in Sanskrit. Besides, both these words are ambiguous &ndash;another reason we can&rsquo;t criticize the translation since we don&rsquo;t know all the shades of meaning of &ldquo;religion&rdquo; nor of &ldquo;dharma&rdquo;. Similarly when &ldquo;brahmin&rdquo; is translated as &ldquo;priest.&rdquo;  Of course Doniger could have translated &ldquo;dharma&rdquo; as &ldquo;perversion&rdquo; and &ldquo;brahmin&rdquo; as &ldquo;idiot&rdquo; and since we don&rsquo;t know what &ldquo;perversion&rdquo; and &ldquo;idiot&rdquo; mean either, we couldn&rsquo;t really criticize that as well.&rdquo;
Again, I did not claim nor did I imply that we must know &ldquo;all shades of meaning&rdquo; (whatever that means in the present context) in order to translate. Nor does it follow from anything I have said that one could then use <em>any word</em> in one language to translate <em>any word</em> from another language.
That there is indeterminacy of meaning in translation does not entail that one denies that words have meanings, surely. Words occur in a language and a language has rules, conventions, dictionaries, and such like. It has a syntax, semantics and pragmatics of communication. Who has denied this? Quine has not; nor have I.
It is the linguistic convention to translate &lsquo;dharma&rsquo; as religion and &lsquo;brahmin&rsquo; as &lsquo;priest&rsquo;. One cannot fulminate against this centuries-old practice unless one comes up with alternatives and shows why the alternative is <em>better</em> than the centuries-old practice. Until such stage is reached, wisdom counsels us to keep quiet. To reach such a stage, <strong>it is not Sanskrit or English that one should study</strong> but the relevant phenomena in the world to build a theory about the phenomenon in question.</li>
<li>The subsequent paragraph simply repeats the same misunderstanding without understanding <a href="/hipkapi/posts/indians-barren-criticisms-of-western-translations/">my post</a>
. Of course, to understand my post and react to that, the presupposition is that one has read what linguists and philosophers of language have written about meaning and use. If one has not done this work, and has merely some vague common-sense ideas about translation, then one should have the minimal humility to keep quiet and not attack Doniger&rsquo;s translation.
This, then, is the &ldquo;point of my argument&rdquo;. Do not think that western intellectuals are idiots and imbeciles. Being an Indian and a native speaker of some Indian language does not give you some marvelous ability to criticize the western intellectuals based on your common-sense ideas about the world. People like Wendy have put in years of serious effort to learn languages and theories and if one wants to take them on, one must make sure that one is their intellectual match. And that requires years (if not decades) of dedicated work. That is the &ldquo;point of my argument&rdquo;.</li>

      <p>The question requires deeper handling so you will forgive me for the brevity of my response but you will get some idea of where I stand.
Regarding the first question as to whether we reject social science itself, I am aware that many people have made this suggestion. I am not so much hung up on the word &lsquo;social science&rsquo; but I do believe that we need to systematically reflect on our experiences in the world. A systematic reflection on experiences in the form of a theory is what we can conveniently call social science. We need theories about the world to understand the World. Systematic thinking means use of certain criteria to decide which theories are good or not, etc. and which to choose. The best thing would be to appeal to the history of the natural sciences over say four hundred years to see how they have done it, what kind of criteria they used. Thus, I belong to the group which advocates systematic reflection on experience, and in that sense, I belong to the group which says we need social science.
Your second question was about Indians having different ways of understanding experience: you spoke of narratives and the autobiography of Tulsi Ram. This raises the question of what form these reflections are going to take. To give a crude example: are they going to be mathematized? Will they take the form of scientific laws or of narratives? That is a very interesting question. But all narratives are not social science: in that case every novelist would have a scientific theory. If a text is an autobiography, it is not social science.

      <p>I am going to ask for a clarification on a question which I find very troubling. Let me first read how you have formulated the problem from the text: Sanskrit scholars need modem social scientists. What disturbs me in anthropological fieldwork is that Sanskrit literature is made to play the role of native informer to social scientists, with the anthropologists asking themselves as they might with Maori culture: is there something valuable which has been lost?
Claus Oetke also makes the same point. Even if you say that the dialogue between the primitive and the anthropologist is sophisticated, native informers are not merely informants. This idea, this interaction pattern which has existed for the last forty years has a double bias&ndash;that of the anthropologist and that of the native informant. They have very powerful dialogues but anthropologists fundamentally take a priori positions, assuming that Sanskritists are the only ones who hold the key: they do not really believe that non-Sanskritists could possibly have anything to contribute.
But it would be absurd to dismiss Indian culture a priori without an investigation into India&rsquo;s intellectual contributions without entertaining the possibility that Indian culture and tradition might today in a very significant sense be a challenge to the Western traditions which form our intellectual background. Your question shuts it out because it comes from Sanskrit. In your story of the fieldwork model, all Indian parameters answer the sophisticated social scientists model. I am surprised because you have another strand which goes in the opposite direction. But the fundamental framework you are using suggests maximally that we might learn something like Sanskrit aesthetics, rasa theory, etc. or even something like curry. This kind of trivialization has resulted from colonialism: it has been and is, very suppressive.

      <p>There are multiple kinds of interpretation. For instance, there is interpretation of symbols in a domain like Physics: μ (in elementary optics) is &ldquo;interpreted&rdquo; as the refraction index of a substance. We use a more or less analogous notion of &ldquo;interpretation&rdquo; in Chemistry, Mathematics and so on. In logic, we speak of &ldquo;interpretation of variables&rdquo; like <em>p</em>, <em>q</em>, etc. Here, it means that the letters stand-in for arbitrary sentences with truth-values.</p>

      <p>Assume that you get a Ph.D student who wants to do medical research. He comes to you and tells you that he wants to find out an answer to the burning question about why people get sick. Would you be able to guide this student in answering his question or give one answer to it? Your answer would be: it depends. You would also further say to him, ‘choose a particular disease, choose a particular domain and choose a particular approach within that domain, if you want to do research’. There is no ‘one answer’ to his question.

      <p>(a) Paolo Friere, a Brazilian educationalist, has spoken about such a phenomenon at length in his <em>Pedagogy of the Oppressed</em>. He calls it as an ‘internalisation of the oppressor by the oppressed’. Whether we use Paolo Friere’s terminology or the much later one of ‘Stockholm Syndrome’, the problem is the same: both <em>name</em> the phenomenon without <em>explaining it</em>. In and of itself, not such a big problem if it is not for a cognitive tendency that is <strong>dominant</strong> in the ‘social sciences’, which brings me to the second point.</p>

<p>Perhaps, one of the ways to test whether your search is taking you in the right direction is by seeing whether it solves a well-known paradox, or explicates it in a novel way. If after research, your hypothesis leads you to a well-known discussion in theology (but <em>lacks</em> the latter&rsquo;s sophistication), then you could be on an uninteresting track.</p>

<p>In certain phases of thinking, unbridled speculations have a serious contribution to make. After some time, it teaches one that there is a very interesting difference between <a href="/hipkapi/posts/arguments-vs-theories/">disciplined speculations and speculations of other sorts</a>
 and that one has to learn the former. However, the only way to learn the former is through the latter.</p>

      <p>I keep teaching my students the need to unlearn: unlearn the desire to &lsquo;show off&rsquo; their erudition; unlearn shallowness and so on. I am more than convinced that whatever we have learnt about human beings can be formulated in a jargon-free language and in a simple manner. There is no need to appear &lsquo;mysterious and profound&rsquo;; nor is there a need for exhibiting one&rsquo;s erudition or &lsquo;critical capacities&rsquo;. On all these counts, most of Foucalt&rsquo;s writings (and that of his commentators) can only call forth anger and irritation.</p>

      <p>I was expecting you to show me where <a href="/hipkapi/posts/intentional-operator-and-inconsistent-reasoning/">the reasoning I formulated goes wrong</a>
, but you do not do so. The analogy you draw, I am afraid, does not quite do the job you want it to.</p>
<ol>
<li>One can easily hold the following two beliefs (your example) without any fear of contradiction:
(a) There is only one way to Bombay (this is it) and (b) There are many ways to Bombay (this is one of them).
The &lsquo;how&rsquo; of it must be obvious: the &rsquo;this&rsquo; is an indexical. Consequently, any person can hold both these beliefs together (at the same time or about the same route) without being contradictory (depending upon what he points out using the word &rsquo;this&rsquo;).
In fact, even statements like (c) &ldquo;Route 19 is the only way to Bombay&rdquo; and (d) &ldquo;Route 24 is one of the ways to Bombay&rdquo; can be held to be true by one and the same person at the same time without fear of contradiction. ( Both  statements would be true if Route 24 allows one to join Route 19 at some point or the other.) In other words, Minimus, your examples do not work the way you want them to.</li>
<li>Regarding my reasoning, this is what you say:</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Hindus may have ideas/opinions about the beliefs of the Christians but &ldquo;beliefs about&rdquo; cannot be compared to &ldquo;beliefs&rdquo; and I think that is the error.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>ut there can be no doubt that for the past thousand years at least the caste system has been a great nightmare for the majority of our people and continues to be a great bane of hindu society as well as hinduism today.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you write this article on the caste system, I do want you very much to make clear where your <em>certainty</em> regarding the nature of the caste system and its baneful impact both on the hindu and the indian society comes from. There is a reason for this request. For some time, I too thought that the ‘Indian caste system’ was an abomination. In order to find out where it came from, the nature of its foundations, and the causes for its continued reproduction, I started reading and researching into the question. Normally, research renders the questions <strong>sharper</strong>, but in this case the subject became <strong>vaguer!</strong> The more I read, the more confusing it all became: everyone seemed to be against the caste system (with a few exceptions) but no one seemed to know what it was! While each had very clear moral opinions on the subject, none had any clear understanding of what they were for/against. Consequently, my request: in your article, please (1) do not <em>assume</em> that the caste system is an evil, but show that it is; (2) do not just say it is <em>obvious</em>that it is a bane, but demonstrate it;  (3) do not <em>just affirm</em> that ‘the dalits’ are victims of an immoral and unjust social organisation, but show how and why they are that. So far, I have not been able to prove any of the above claims <em>scientifically</em> (or even unscientifically). Everyone seems to assume it, and the (literally) thousands of books and articles I have read on this score fail miserably in even saying what ‘the caste system’ is, leave alone <em>prove</em> that it is the cause of many social and cultural ills in our culture and society. May I look forward to something that at least provides me with a semblance of a proof?</p>

      <p>Here is the question: How would one translate the word &lsquo;God&rsquo; into, say, Sanskrit? Now, the answer has to satisfy certain conditions because the question also meets certain conditions. Let me say very clearly what all these are, so that the playground and the rules are transparent and favour no one party in the dispute.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I propose we accept the best theory of meaning that exists in the market place. As far as I know, the book that plays this role most admirably, while satisfying the proponents of different theories of meaning expounded during the last century or so, is Prashant Parikh&rsquo;s &ldquo;Language and Equilibrium&rdquo; (The MIT press, 2010). His formal apparatus allows for the existence of &lsquo;word meanings&rsquo; without sacrificing the idea that the meaning of sentences are context-dependent and makes sense of even such statements as &ldquo;the meaning of red light is&hellip;&rdquo; That is to say, it does not restrict &lsquo;meaning&rsquo; to words and sentences alone; it also allows us to deal with &lsquo;word meaning&rsquo; as well, as it is in our case. If my colleagues unanimously prefer another &rsquo;theory of meaning&rsquo;, I would like to know what it is. In all probability, I would not take issue with an alternate choice.</p>

      <p>This one begins to reflect about the principle of charity in relationship to the current US President, Donald Trump (from now on, Trump).</p>
<p>As you might know, the principle of charity has been formulated in different ways by different people. (Even the first page of a google search of the word ‘principle of charity’ allows you to access many of these documents quickly.) This post will stick strictly to your formulation: “a principle of charity says that (like the rain dance) a long-standing  practice should not be attributed to idiocy without strong evidence”. This formulation itself will not be questioned but assumed as a given. The only evidence used in this post is an extremely fragmentary viewing of the CNN and the BBC World coverages of Trump during the last week or so. (No thorough viewing of either of the two channels is claimed; the references in this post merely pick out fragments from programs as memory ‘recalls’ them today.) Two dramatis personae: Some media coverage and the event of Trump presidency; one question: what does the principle of charity do or advocate in the following cases? Such cases can be indefinitely multiplied but it is restricted here to five. One side of the argument is presented briefly only because that side of the argument is in wide circulation.</p>

      <p>Why understanding bullshit is important?  Three reasons: (a) there is a very frequent use of the word ‘bullshit’ (mostly in my posts); (b) bullshit has been tied directly to truth in the literature on the subject, (c) far more important is the fact that it is much more connected to <em>knowledge</em> than has so far been acknowledged. In this post, the focus is on the third reason.</p>
<p><strong>I</strong></p>
<p>First, an ‘autobiographical’ point: I was charmed by how Akeel Bilgrami spoke about ‘bullshit’, when we met each other for the first time. Akeel also said that we call this ‘bakwas’ in Hindi. This resulted in revisiting <a href="http://www2.csudh.edu/ccauthen/576f12/frankfurt__harry_-_on_bullshit.pdf" rel="noopener">Harry Frankfurt’s article on the issue</a>
; it further led to reading the late <a href="http://www.ditext.com/cohen/Cohen.pdf" rel="noopener">G.A. Cohen’s contribution on the topic</a>
 and going through most of the literature on the subject. (Some interesting stuff on the theme is collected in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bullshit-Philosophy-Guaranteed-Perfect-Results/dp/0812696115" rel="noopener">an edited volume</a>
 on the subject that was published a few years ago.) Since then, some on and off thinking on the subject has been going on, some of whose results you shall notice in this post.</p>

<p>Speaking about the &lsquo;use&rsquo; or the &lsquo;results and effects&rsquo; of theories has a very venerable ancestry in the western philosophy. It is called &ldquo;pragmatism&rdquo;, if the &rsquo;truth&rsquo; is coupled to the &lsquo;uses&rsquo; and &lsquo;results and effects&rsquo;; it becomes &ldquo;instrumentalism&rdquo;, if the notion of truth is dispensed with. So, it might be useful if you were to familiarize with their arguments. (There is nothing specifically &lsquo;Indian&rsquo; with these claims, nor is there (of course) any need for there to be something.)</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Causality&rdquo; is not a notion in physics but  comes from philosophy. Perhaps, you have forgotten that there existed (and exist) generations of scientists and philosophers of science who deny that &ldquo;causality&rdquo; has anything to do with sciences. Some argue this by suggesting that scientific theories do not describe the structure of the world but are merely useful instruments in prediction and control. These theories are not &ldquo;useful&rdquo; because they identify the causal forces in the world (and, hence,&ldquo;true&rdquo; in the semantic sense) anymore than the efficacy of the igloo proves that the Eskimo&rsquo;s theory about the igloo is true.</p>

      <p>The Ancient (and modern) philosophers make the distinction between beliefs that are merely opinions of individuals and beliefs that are knowledge claims. Today, when modern philosophers speak of ‘doxastic coherence’ about the Greek thinkers, they do not merely mean that there should be a coherence in beliefs but also that Ancient philosophers have not produced knowledge but merely express opinions. Some also believe that all philosophy is mere ‘doxa’ but not ‘episteme’. The problem is this: what distinguishes a ‘doxastic’ sentence from an ‘epistemic’ sentence? One possibility was to say that ‘episteme’ was ‘justified true belief’ and not just a ‘mere belief’. This collapsed following the Gettier paradox which shows that this definition of ‘knowledge’ does not distinguish between mere opinion and knowledge. Today, one uses ‘doxastic coherence’ not as a technical term but as a judgement either about knowledge or about Greek thinkers or both or to signal that one thinks everything is an opinion. If one does not signal any of these, it is jargon.</p>

      <p>Imagine I ‘hypothesize’ that I will win the lottery. If I buy a ticket and do not win, clearly my ‘hypothesis’ is ‘falsified’. Is it, therefore, scientific? Such silly hypotheses are dime a dozen. Do you think Popper was worried about this?
How to falsify my hypothesis. The answer is very simple: the way scientific theories can be falsified. I spell out some consequences of my hypothesis in Chapter 11. Even though there are more, if these ‘evidences’ as I call them there are untrue, my hypothesis stands refuted in its present form. You can also test the hypothesis by refuting other sub-hypotheses that are partially derived from the main hypothesis: like, the pagan relationship between ‘religio’ and ‘traditio’ that I postulate. If you can show that many, many authors from Antiquity deny my postulation and see ‘religion’ as that which binds all people together into one single community (for instance), my sub-hypothesis is severely damaged. Falsification is about the phenomena that a theory forbids from occurring; it has nothing to do with how to protect a theory from falsification. You cannot take a single conjecture and speak about its falsification: even according to Popper, theories are the basic units of falsification and not individual conjectures. To Lakatos and Laudan, the units are much bigger; to Quine, it is our entire web of beliefs, and so on. That is why I took the example of the Lottery ticket, which is an individual conjecture.</p>

      <p>You say: “As far as I know, &ldquo;doxastic coherence&rdquo; means consistency in beliefs and that is all that is of relevance here.” It is not. Doxastic coherence is coherence between beliefs considered as opinions; its contrast set is “epistemic coherence” i.e., coherence between beliefs as knowledge claims. Further, in some senses, while there can be no coherence if there is no (logical) consistency between sentences within a particular theory, ‘coherence’ does not mean ‘consistency of beliefs’. One could have a coherent set of beliefs even if it comprises of mutually exclusive or even (logically) inconsistent subsets of beliefs. That is because (logical) ‘consistency’ is defined within a particular meta-logic, whereas ‘coherence’ applies to discourses. They do not, therefore, mean the same. One can have a coherent discourse, where multiple logics are used in different fragments of the same discourse. While some logics could allow material implication (or some other logical connective), other logics used within the same discourse might consider material implication an invalid rule of inference. This inconsistency (one and the same rule of inference is both valid and invalid) in two different fragments of a discourse does not make the discourse incoherent. In such a context, ‘doxastic coherence’ names a coherent discourse but does not pick out a (logically) consistent set of opinions.</p>

      <p>You say: &ldquo;there seems to be an underlying assumption that all participants in the thread seem to be making. The assumption being that all these texts have the same end goal in mind, and that this end goal is enlightenment/eudaimonia/happiness. I submit that such an assumption is unwarranted.&rdquo;</p>
<ol>
<li>It is not an assumption but an explicit hypothesis, as far as I am concerned, that all the Indian traditions (not just these two sets of texts, namely, Upanishads and Puranas) are concerned with the same end goal. I want to provide a description of the Indian traditions as attempts to help human beings find happiness on earth. (For the time being, in order to avoid fruitless controversies and to have a point of departure, I take Aristotelian Eudaimonia to be an explication of this notion of happiness.)</li>
<li>Assumptions often do require warrant, but hypotheses do not. Because the truth of a conclusion depends on the truth of the premise (often, assumptions function as premises in an argument) provided valid rules of inferences are used, it makes sense to ask for the warrant of an assumption. Needless to say, this condition does not hold for hypotheses: you have to evaluate them entirely differently.</li>
<li>Of course, in one sense, such a reconstruction would be the hypothesis I propose. Until such stage, the belief about the commonality of the goal of the Indian traditions would be an assumption. However, it is not a premise in a logical deduction but one which functions as a heuristic. Consequently, if I need to convince you to accept this assumption for the time being, I need to show you what is cognitively interesting about this assumption.</li>
<li>It promises to help explain the rivalry within the Indian traditions; it sheds new light on the inter-relationship between them in a different way than as &lsquo;syncretism&rsquo;; it helps one look for a set of problems underlying the Indian traditions; it allows one to formulate these problems in the twenty-first century language; it helps one evaluate the answers of these traditions and even carry them forward. These are some of the cognitive benefits of this assumption.</li>
<li>Of course, ultimately, it might turn out to be the case that no such goal is to be found and that the Indian traditions are not each other&rsquo;s rivals. I do not know. For the time being, this idea appears very productive. That is enough of a warrant.

<p>One confuses between a definition and a hypothesis. Definitions tell us how we use a word and which objects it refers to. In the case of the term ‘religion’, a definition should merely address this referential task: which things are we referring to, when we use this word. It cannot give us any understanding of the structure or properties of religion and does not have empirical consequences (much as defining any other word, say ‘species’ or ‘psychosis’, does not have empirical consequences). It merely points out the phenomena that are to be theorized. The result of this second process of theorizing is a hypothesis, which characterizes the properties or structure of a phenomenon.</p>
