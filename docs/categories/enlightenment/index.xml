      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You say: “&amp;lsquo;person + Indriya + Manas  is the Bhokta&amp;rsquo; renders the sentence meaningless to me.” While that could be true, that sentence makes (and made) perfect sense to millions (over the last two millennia) on earth. Would it help if it read instead: “soul + Indriya + Manas  is the Bhokta; ” or “my inner self + Indriya + Manas  is the Bhokta” or “ the pudgala + Indriya + Manas  is the Bhokta” or any such combination? If it does, then I do not see why ‘person’ would make the sentence meaningless; person is used as a synonym here. Moreover, if using ‘atman’ makes the sentence meaningful (irrespective of, as you put it, “whatever it be’), what is the problem if the word ‘person’ is used to translate ‘atman’? If the meaning problem re-emrges, it must lie in what you think the ‘person’ is, is it not?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Are you raising a translation issue (how to translate dehinaH) here? It means ‘bodied’, ‘that which is bodied” (whatever that may be, to use your phrase). If you have knowledge of what ‘that’ (tat) is, you might say that it ‘has’ a body, it ‘possesses a body’, it ‘owns’ the body, it is ‘in’ the body, etc., depending on whether ‘thatness’ (tatva) is capable of ‘having’, or ‘owning’ or ‘possessing’ and is ‘indwelling’ and so on.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;As you can see, it is actually a knowledge issue about ‘tat’ (that) and ‘tatva’ (thatness). You can be a tatva darshi (one who has seen ‘thatness’) but yet not be a gyaani (i.e., not have the knowledge of what tatva is).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In my talk that you refer to, I raise a question about a knowledge issue. Is atman ‘inside’ the body, i.e., does dehinaH mean ‘embodied’ or is it merely ‘the bodied’ in the second chapter of the Gita?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;II&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Spirituality = Adhyatma?</title>
      <link>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/spirituality-adhyatma/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One could justifiably see spirituality (the Jewish, Christian and Islamic) as ‘Adhyatma’ if one focusses on the psychological transformations that a human being undergoes in the process of moving from the mundane life to a ‘spiritual’ one. You would be closer to the notion of ‘Adhyatma’ if you can also additionally guide such a process. Such guidance requires, of course, that there is some deep understanding of such transformative processes and their mechanisms.&#xA;Yet, I would be hesitant to suggest that ‘spirituality’ translates ‘adhyatma’ or the other way round. From among the many reasons, I pick three:&#xA;(a) because the weight of the word ‘spirituality’ is drawn from Christianity, i.e., the kind of transformative force on a human being that we have in mind is the work of the ‘holy spirit’, it would be inappropriate to translate ‘adhyatma’ as ‘spirituality’;&#xA;(b) it is difficult to characterize the changes in human beings that we are talking about by using this word in Islam and Judaism as well. There is no ‘holy spirit’ in these two religions that does the work of the Trinitarian holy spirit;&#xA;(c) since a ‘spiritual’ person is the result of the workings of the holy spirit, in the context of Adhyatma which insists that transformations are the results of human phenomena working on human beings, the use of this word would be inappropriate. Both the Christian and the Adhyatmic use militates against such a translation.&#xA;In short, no, we should not translate ‘spirituality’ as ‘adhyatma’.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Moral luck and gyanodaya</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#xA;I think that the multiple routes that exist in the Indian culture and those that individuals follow are on par with each other. From within any one of these, the other routes appear as moments. However, this does not privilege any one route above the other.&#xA;If one were to suggest, say, that the Puranic stories are simplifications of the Upanishadic insights then one has to endorse a claim of the following sort.  What makes some sets of sentences into a simplification of other sets of sentences is that the former leaves out nuances, qualifications, conditionalities, and so on of the latter. That is to say, the simplification is less true (or more conditionally true) than the complex version. In this way we would get a hierarchy of statements (from complex to the simple), where each succeeding simplification is less true than the predecessor. Only the statement at the apex of such a pyramid would be the truest of the lot. Then, we would have but one set of true statements. Relative to this set, all other statements would be false.&#xA;In such a case, there would be no plurality of traditions. There would be but one &amp;rsquo;true&amp;rsquo; path; all other paths would not lead us to the same goal as the true one does. Not only that. Under such a construction, enlightenment would not be something that all human beings could strive for and achieve; only &amp;lsquo;some&amp;rsquo; (those who are able to understand the Upanishadic claims) could do so. Consequently, one has to add a rider: only some people (endowed only in one particular way) could find happiness (eudaimonia, enlightenment).&#xA;The strength of the Indian traditions lies, amongst other things, in their unconditional claim: all human beings can find happiness. The differences between human beings (no matter whether this difference is biological, sociological, psychological in nature) matter only when it comes to the choice of the path best suited for them. If this statement is true, then the Puranic stories cannot be, under any interpretation of the word, simplifications of more complex claims.&#xA;II&#xA;I cannot quite figure out whether we are talking about different things or expressing differing points of view or simply using different words. I am talking about two contrast sets: &amp;lsquo;simplification&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;complexity&amp;rsquo;, whereas you seem to talk about &amp;lsquo;simplicity&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;complication&amp;rsquo; (also at times using &amp;lsquo;complex&amp;rsquo; as a synonym for &amp;lsquo;complicated&amp;rsquo;). You are right that simplification and complexity apply to descriptions; that is why I spoke of both of them in terms of &amp;lsquo;sets of sentences&amp;rsquo; (in some language or another). Let me explain what I mean.&#xA;If there is a &amp;lsquo;simple&amp;rsquo; and a &amp;lsquo;complicated&amp;rsquo; explanation available to me, and they are alternatives in the sense that they do more or less the same job in explaining what needs to be explained, then I would prefer a simple to a complicated explanation. Here, the difference between these two explanations resides in the fact that the complicated explanation uses more concepts than the simple one does but both do the same job. (Let us leave aside why I choose a simple explanation; the reasons have to do with my philosophical preferences.)&#xA;In the case of a &amp;lsquo;simplified&amp;rsquo; and a &amp;lsquo;complex&amp;rsquo; explanation, the situation is different. The simplified set of statements (mostly) makes use of non-technical vocabulary to get across the point of a complex explanation. The simplification leaves aside qualifications, presuppositions, conditions, etc. which are all required for the explanation to really explain some phenomenon or another. (Elegantly written popularizing books on physics, biology, chemistry, etc. belong to the class of simplifications of complex explanations.) So, all a layperson like me needs is a book that simplifies the complex explanations of the physicists about blackholes, of the geneticists about gene-sequencing, etc. in order for me to get some idea of what these physicists and geneticists are doing. Unlike a text-book in physics or in genetics, these popularizing books that simplify complex ideas DO NOT enable me to do physics or genetics. Instead, they make use of the rich resources of a natural language (similes, metaphors, analogies, examples, jokes, etc.) to get an idea approximately across to someone like me who lacks the technical expertise in the area or domain under consideration.&#xA;Now comes the question of the relationship between the Upanishadic statements and Puranic stories. If, as you seem to suggest now and then in your post to me, it is the case that Puranic stories tell me &amp;ldquo;in simple terms&amp;rdquo; something that the Upanishads make &amp;ldquo;complicated&amp;rdquo; (or render the same in &amp;lsquo;abstruse&amp;rsquo; terms, as you put it), then my choice is clear: go for the Puranic stories all the way.  Under this construal, Puranic stories are alternatives to the Upanishadic claims. I do not believe this to be the case.&#xA;Do the puranic stories simplify the complex claims of the Upanishads? If they did, analogous to what I said above, the puranic stories could not help me attain enlightenment, much the same way a popularizing book on modern day physics does not enable me to do research in physics today. Then, the only way I can do physics is by learning physics; similarly the only way to attain enlightenment would be to understand the Upanishads. I do not buy this either. That is why I do not think that Puranic stories are simplifications of the Upanishads.&#xA;III&#xA;Question: The relationship between the Puranas and the Upanishads with regards to simplification need not necessarily be of the type Popular Science Books : Physics Text Books. It could be of the type Undergraduate Physics Text Books : Graduate Physics Text Books. They could be dealing with same subject, but the coverage, depth, and rigour could be different. But both will help one learn Physics and do Physics.&#xA;A good point, even though it is not entirely clear to me what that point does to my argument. Therefore, let me think aloud and consider two ways in which undergraduate textbooks in physics help you to do physics.&#xA;Let us suppose you learn Snell&amp;rsquo;s law of refraction, Maxwell&amp;rsquo;s law of electro-magnetism and, say, an introductory chapter on Nuclear physics. Let us say that you also do some laboratory experiments on the first two. No doubt, you are learning to do physics now. Do they help you do research on Nuclear physics immediately  thereafter? Today, their function is entirely different: they are propaedeutics, courses that provide you with an introduction to the subject. They help you acquire the necessary apparatus to learn more and go deeper into the subject. They are not simplifications of complex explanations but ones that provide you with some rudimentary notions, using which you can learn other concepts. When you learn about the atomic value of an element in Chemistry, this piece of knowledge does not simplify. You merely learn that elements have atomic values and you might also learn something about what that word means. You will come across the idea of electrons, their orbits and nucleus. You are taught that electrons can be excited but you also learn that it has something to do with energy. In other words, the undergraduate texts prepare you for research; you do as laboratory experiments what research was to your predecessors. In this sense, because the frontier of knowledge keeps moving, the nature and kind of preparation required to do research also keeps shifting.&#xA;Do the Puranic stories have a similar propaedutic function with respect to the Upanishads? If they do, then you are suggesting something like the following: enlightenment consists of vertical hierarchy of knowledge elements and that one can become enlightened if and only if one has gone through the phase of undergraduation. If you want to argue this, then you are committed to saying that there is only one route to enlightenment. The other paths train you to tread the Upanishadic path. &amp;lsquo;All routes lead to Jnana&amp;rsquo; and only though that can you achieve enlightenment.&#xA;Three things require noting in this regard. One is that this is a description that those who follow this path provide with regard to other paths: all other paths are moments in one&amp;rsquo;s own path. While this could be true of one&amp;rsquo;s own development, it overlooks the fact that disciples of the other paths say exactly the same thing with respect to their own path. The second thing is that it makes enlightenment &amp;lsquo;conditional&amp;rsquo; upon possessing some specific ability or another. In the same way not every undergraduate student in physics can go on to do research in physics, it suggests that only some can attain enlightenment. The third thing is that such a position cannot account for the rivalry between the different Indian traditions: their rivalry is not at the level of a competition between different undergraduate texts, namely, which of the paths brings you to the path of &amp;lsquo;jnana&amp;rsquo; quicker and better. Instead, they claim that they all help you in achieving enlightenment and that &amp;lsquo;jnana&amp;rsquo; itself is but one of the paths to enlightenment.&#xA;Let me now consider the following question: is there any way of deciding which kind of research in physics is better? That is to say, is research in Plasma physics better than research in solid state physics, or doing research in astrophysics? The only way of making sense of this question is to relativize it to an individual&amp;rsquo;s concern of wanting to know the area in which s/he should do research: In which area do I want to do research and why?&#xA;The multiple paths to human happiness is something analogous to the above situation, as I see the issue. Being happy or enlightened (as you know, I use these two words as synonyms) is like doing research in physics. It is not an &amp;rsquo;end state&amp;rsquo;; it is a goal only in the sense of &amp;lsquo;doing research in physics&amp;rsquo; can be our goal. Whether you do research in plasma physics or solid state physics, you are doing research in physics; in the same way, Upanishads and puranas help you find happiness. There is no hierarchy of any sort between them.&#xA;IV&#xA;I intended to speak of &amp;ldquo;two ways in which undergraduate textbooks in physics help you to do physics&amp;rdquo; but ended up writing only about one way. Here is the second of the two ways I wanted to consider.&#xA;Assume, for a moment, that both Upanishads and Puranas are propaedeutics to &amp;ldquo;doing research&amp;rdquo;, i.e., to be happy. Could we then compare them and say which one of them is better? Though I cannot answer this question on the basis of my experience, I think even the enlightened would face the following issue, which I have often faced in my career.&#xA;When you have acquired the competence in some domain and are doing further research, people often ask you for a &amp;ldquo;good text book&amp;rdquo;. I find this an extremely difficult question to answer. The reason is this: I find a text book a &amp;lsquo;good one&amp;rsquo;, if it gives me (the experienced researcher) a very good overview of my field of research, beginning with (what I consider) rudimentary ideas. However, I have discovered (through my own experience) that what is a &amp;lsquo;good text book&amp;rsquo; to me is more often than not a &amp;lsquo;very bad text book&amp;rsquo;, if you look at it from a pedagogical point of view. One who begins learning a new field requires another kind of introduction than what I would consider a &amp;lsquo;good introduction&amp;rsquo;. As an experienced researcher, I find a systematic overview of my domain a &amp;lsquo;good introduction&amp;rsquo;; those who begin to learn a new domain require a good introduction to learn and not a &amp;lsquo;systematic overview&amp;rsquo;. Our requirements are different. That is also the reason why writing a &amp;lsquo;good text book&amp;rsquo; (or being a teacher) is not something every good researcher can do. Only some can be good teachers; only a few can write good text books.&#xA;In this sense, I believe that even the enlightened would face analogous problems. Some might find some or another Upanishad a &amp;lsquo;good introduction&amp;rsquo;; some find that just one of the Mahavakyas is enough; yet others find the puranic stories sublime. The only one who can decide about it is the student. What helps him/her to find happiness is the thing that works for that person. More, one cannot say.&#xA;V&#xA;You ask what I mean by this: Three things require noting in this regard. One is that this is a description that those who follow this path provide with regard to other paths: all other paths are moments in one&amp;rsquo;s own path. While this could be true of one&amp;rsquo;s own development, it overlooks the fact that disciples of the other paths say exactly the same thing with respect to their own path.&amp;quot;&#xA;What I mean: Bhakti, for instance, claims that it is the best path to enlightenment because both the &amp;lsquo;Karma&amp;rsquo; and the &amp;lsquo;jnana&amp;rsquo; path are the subordinate moments of Bhakti. (I speak about this more in detail in my “How to speak for the Indian traditions&amp;quot; article.) All I want to suggest is that teach path (karmic, Jnana, Bhakti, yogic, Tantric, meditative, etc) is special to the practitioner and S/he sees in it the presence of all other paths. We need to account for this stance&#xA;Why I say this in the context of the discussion: let us, for the time being, associate puranic stories with the practice of puja, and consider this too as a path to enlightenment. Were we to say that one does not achieve enlightenment through this manner and claim that only &amp;lsquo;jnana&amp;rsquo; leads one to enlightenment, then we cannot account for the claim (that many in our traditions make) that illiterate people, with their simple practice of doing a daily puja to some vigraha or another (or even to trees), also achieve enlightenment. In our accounts of and attempts at understanding enlightenment, we need to account for these claims. (We could account for them by saying they are false; but I take them seriously.)&#xA;You ask: &amp;ldquo;But what&amp;rsquo;s wrong with believing that only some can attain enlightenment? No-one&amp;rsquo;s claiming that some people are being forcibly shut out. Technically speaking, enlightenment is open to all. But to me your view is analogous to saying that everyone can be an opera singer or a fabulous dancer.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;One&amp;rsquo;s ability to become an opera singer or a fabulous dancer is conditional: it depends on one&amp;rsquo;s biological inheritance and one&amp;rsquo;s aptitude, among other things. It also depends on one&amp;rsquo;s skill and practice; one&amp;rsquo;s teachers and so on. Human happiness, according to how I understand the Indian traditions, is accessible to all. Every one of us can be happy. Not merely &amp;rsquo;technically&amp;rsquo;, as you put it, but also in reality. The fact, however, that all of us are not happy has led the Indian traditions to investigate things that stand in the way of human happiness. It has also made them discover various means and modalities to overcome these impediments. All human beings, if they seek happiness, can really become happy. The possibility of achieving this goal does not depend on  some kind of &amp;lsquo;moral luck&amp;rsquo;, the way being an opera singer or a fabulous dancer does. &amp;ldquo;Seek, and ye shall find&amp;rdquo;, our traditions seem to say. (I speak about these things more in detail in the talk I gave at the Catholic University of Louvain.) Finding happiness is not a question of accident or luck; it is the guaranteed result of a search.&#xA;Is Enlightenment different from happiness? Well, here one chooses one&amp;rsquo;s own terminology, I guess. The happiness that I speak about is what Aristotle called &amp;lsquo;Eudaimonia&amp;rsquo;: as that which if a person has, s/he will never lose. There might be more to enlightenment than happiness, as defined above. However, I do believe that enlightenment is the only &amp;lsquo;property&amp;rsquo; which, if you once have it, you will never lose. No other human quality has this nature.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Two caveats. One: the commentary is very, very short. To write down all the things I want to say about this citation requires a long paper and not a brief mail. Two: I have not checked either the citation or the reference (Brihadaranyaka upanishad - I.iv.10). I assume that both are accurate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This (Self) was indeed Brahman in the beginning. It knew itself only as &amp;ldquo;I am Brahman.&amp;rdquo; Therefore it became all.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Question: “Certainly that Brahman == self-awareness == Atman is also a matter of direct experience, not of intellectual reasoning?”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let me first begin with reason and then drift towards experience.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Suppose, as an expansion of the sentence that ‘Atman is Brahman’, it is said: “Atman and Brahman are identical to each other”. What kind of sense does it make and how do we explain that sense? Let us note that this sentence makes linguistic sense. Therefore, the question is, how do you parse this sentence to bring out that sense?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Atman, Witness, and Experience</title>
      <link>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/atman-and-experience/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 02 May 2020 10:56:38 +0530</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/atman-and-experience/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some Swamiji claims: “One cannot experience the Atman[, the Atman] is the witness, it is what experiences.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Obviously, this is a very rough and approximate formulation. This statement is both wrong and right in different ways. (a) In the very early days, when I began to develop my meditation exercise, I ‘sensed’ the vague presence of an observer (somewhere present in the background of my experiential world). Or, you could say, I vaguely sensed that I was being ‘seen’ or that my meditative performance was being performed for an ‘outside’ observer. Perhaps, it would also be accurate to say that I sensed its vague presence outside my meditative world, but touching upon its edges. Later, when I was trying to help other people meditate, I discovered that some sensed this presence too and yet others had to ‘let go’ in order to sense this presence. I am guessing that this is the idea of Atman as a ‘witness’. Some were fearful and afraid of this presence as well. If you say that to sense the vague presence is to experience that presence, the Swamiji is wrong. If you see this vague sensing of a presence (or sensing the vague presence of something) as not experiencing, the Swamij would be right. (b) Does the Atman experience? If you keep the word ‘experience’ sufficiently broad (or nebulous), yes, that is true. Self-awareness is obviously ‘aware’ (working purely at a linguistic level); self-consciousness is obviously ‘conscious’ (I say this in my note as well to understand the access). In this sense, yes, the Swamiji is right. However, the Swamiji is wrong if we claim, which we have to, that experience (as we know it today) requires some kind of bodily constraint (i.e. the presence of an apparatus to experience). We have to say here that self-consciousness is not tantamount to ‘experience’. Then the question opens up: if self-consciousness is not ‘experience’ what else is it? I have no answer except to say that it is ‘self-consciousness’, period. It is also further true, on both accounts, that &lt;strong&gt;sentience does not experience self-consciousness but merely accesses it.&lt;/strong&gt; In that case, the next problem: what does this access generate? Some or another kind of experience or not? If we cannot provide some kind of a satisfactory answer, the word ‘access’ is an occult word and does no work. (These are not the only set of problems, but it does indicate why understanding ‘enlightenment’ is far, far more difficult than achieving that state.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/accessing-para-real/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It would be a good thing to narrow-in on the ‘spookiness’ of the accessing &amp;lsquo;Real&amp;rsquo;. However, because there is a very great danger that ‘access’ can be conceptualised as an access to a ‘supra-mundane’ or a ‘spiritual’ world, or to a world that is not accessible to ‘sciences’  but can be ‘spiritually’ accessed, etc. a few extra words are required. Therefore, an attempt that might reduce one possible kind of spookiness that you might be referring to.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Let us agree on the proposed division into two categories: “1) That which exists or could exist (2) That which could not and does not exist but is present (therefore ‘Real’)”. Let us also accept that (1) collects: “(a) everything that we know like Earth, stars, mud, (b) everything that we can think of or imagine - models, formulas, triangles, present and future scientific theories, tooth fairies, ‘murtis’ of Ganesha, methods or procedures of performing ‘abhisheka’ etc. (these exist and could exist in our minds, even the ‘Real’ we imagine still belongs here as long as it is an imagined object)”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;To help you think through the problem you &amp;ldquo;whether Christians can get enlightened&amp;rdquo;, try using this analogy. Something, let us call it ‘daffodil’, fascinates us. Let us also assume that a great deal of concern and interest is expressed about it. Consider two scenarios now, each of which testifies to our fascination.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first scenario is this. There is versification (call it ‘poetry’) and ‘embodiment’ (paintings and sculptures) of ‘daffodil’; imaginative eulogies (novels) and intimidating discourses (‘philosophy’) about ‘daffodil’ abound, etc. These classifications are based on our understanding of what art, poetry, philosophy etc. are. There are also many collations of fragmentary sentences that appear to violate metres of poetry or styles of prose. They are revered as revolutionary breakthroughs (made by the heroes of the ‘masses’ transgressing such elitist notions like ‘grammar’, ‘style’, etc.) that are ‘blinding in their beauty’. In short, there is a huge collection of material about ‘daffodil’.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Colonial Consciousness and Enlightenment</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post will use an imagery as its organising thread, which tracks the search for enlightenment in terms of notions known to us from our secondary and higher education.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If we consider the search for happiness in these terms, then the ideas expressed &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/tattvadarshi-gyaani-and-bullshitter/&#34;&gt;there&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; could be reformulated thus: as human beings, almost all of us would like to be literates or would like to have a primary education. This is the move ‘away’ for unhappiness that all of us aim at, namely, to be ‘less unhappy’. After a period of time, many of us would like to move further. This is the move ‘towards’ (peace of mind, contentment, satisfied, etc.) happiness now formulated in positive terms: the phase of secondary education. The completion of this process is to reach a state of peace (shanti), or contentment (samadhana), or satisfaction (trupti) etc. The Sri Sri’s and the Sadguru’s of this world help us here through their Sudarshan Kriya’s, their yogic practices, their meditative courses and so on. The vipassana meditation, the Satsangh’s, the bhajans, the dhyaanas etc. are also situated here. Some people in this phase also call themselves Saadhakas, doing their ‘saadhana’ on a very regular basis.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Suppose that you want to go further and, therefore, seek higher education (call it Ananda, or happiness). There are two broad routes here: technical or vocational education is one route; university education is another. If you want to be plumber, a carpenter, a sculptor, a painter, a machinist…then you are better-off choosing technical education. However, you could also go for a university education. There is no ‘higher’ or ‘lower’ here; both are different forms of higher education. (Of course, there are endless discussions about ‘superiority’: one group disparagingly calls the other ‘vocational training’, while the other caricatures the first as ‘purely theoretical’ that is unsuited for fulfilling the ‘need’ for useful education or the ‘needs’ of society.) A society cannot survive without plumbers, electricians, machinists, artists, etc. Nor can it live without the ‘ivory tower’ that universities are and should be. Individual students make their choice based on multiple reasons (from aptitude to financial rewards) and many gifted teachers prefer to teach in vocational or professional schools than in a university. However, whatever the choice, both demand that the student specifies clearly what s/he wants to learn: do you want to be a sculptor or a machinist; in which subject do you want  your bachelor and Master’s degree? ‘Ananda’, the generic word, does not suffice here because it merely picks out ‘higher education’: do you want to do physics or chemistry or biology or English literature at the university? ‘Gyaana marga’ (the university) on the one hand and ‘other routes’ (vocational and professional training) on the other hand are the main avenues in higher education.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Within the framework of this imagery, ‘enlightenment’ refers to the total process of ‘higher education’ and ‘seeking ananda’ fixes the goal of higher education. Each avenue has its way of classifying its internal levels or divisions (Bachelors, Masters, Doctoral, Post-doctoral in the university, for example) and teaches students accordingly. They share many commonalities: the subject matter, the instruments, the theoretical frameworks, etc. etc. They are also different from each other in ways of teaching, investigating, making and reporting discoveries, and so on. The names of some teachers in higher education are known to us: Buddha, Shankara, Ramanuja, Madhva, Vallabha, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, Ramana, Nisargadatta Maharaj, etc. Let us not deal with the question whether they taught at the University or were active in professional or technical education because something else of greater importance has to be noticed: you have to choose the ‘subject’ of higher education first. ‘Seeking Happiness’ or ‘wanting enlightenment’ are not adequate at all. You need to specifiy what you are seeking and, preferably, why.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Psychological Traits and Enlightenment: Ignorance and Knowledge</title>
      <link>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/ignorance-knowledge-psychological-traits-and-enlightenment/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;About the relationship between scientific knowledge and enlightenment: If every human being can become enlightened (at any time, place or culture), it logically follows that some or another hypothesis about the world cannot be a requirement to become enlightened. People were enlightened (in the past) without possessing knowledge that humankind has today; one can become enlightened without being a physicist or a geneticist; one can believe in the existence of ghosts and spirits and still be enlightened… and so on. In the same way one can seek and find enlightenment while believing that human body is composed of five sheaths, one can also become enlightened by dismissing the idea of five sheaths as a false and primitive belief. There is, however, a caveat that ties knowledge to enlightenment. Perhaps, a contemporary example would help here.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Humility is a despicable vice</title>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Christianity (to some extent Judaism), presented an idea, unknown to the world in which it grew, namely the Pagan world of Rome. The idea was that human beings are creatures of God and that they belonged to His domain. He was the dominus or the Lord of the domain. As a result, human beings should not be arrogant, but must be humble instead. (As the ‘Book of Job’ in the Old Testament makes it clear, there is a very heavy price to be paid for arrogance.) Here, it belonged to the opposite spectrum in Ancient thought, which saw arrogance as a moral virtue and humility as a despicable vice. Protestant Christianity, especially Luther and Calvin, very forcefully propagated this idea: Man was a sinner, worse than the lowest worm, because of which God’s Grace becomes unfathomable and ungraspable.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Alleged conflict between &#39;Buddhism&#39; and &#39;Brahmanism&#39;</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If the ‘I’ cannot be individuated or described, then there is no possible distinction between the ‘I’ and ‘the Brahman’. They are different names for ‘self-awareness’ which pick out the differential access that individuals have to ‘self-awareness’. Hence, the curious distinction that some Indian traditions make. On the one hand, the ‘I’ is alleged to be identical with the ‘Brahman’; on the other, the same traditions distinguish between ‘Atmagyaana’ and ‘Brahmagyaana’. These two ‘gyanaas’ can be two types of knowledge, if, on one reading, they are knowledge about two different objects, namely ‘atman’ and ‘Brahman’. If, however, they are identical, there could be only one knowledge. Second, even that is not possible. We can only have knowledge of something, if that something exists. If Atman or Brahman exist in this Universe, they are also subject to the processes that occur here. One such is decay and disintegration. Therefore, if we think this problem through, there is only one conclusion possible (if we assume that all Indians have not always been imbeciles): the gyaana is about the processes of accessing the real. It is not and cannot be about the real.&#xA;This means that the debate within the Indian traditions is not and could not have been about the nature of ‘atman’ or ‘Brahman’. Thus, the idea that is propagated as ‘the’ truth about the alleged conflict between the dvaita and the advaita is spurious and false. There was clearly debates and conflicts. But these cannot be about the nature of the real.&#xA;The same is true about the alleged conflict between ‘Buddhism’ and ‘Brahmanism’. Atman and Anatman are not conflicting doctrines about the real at all; they could not be. It is logically impossible that this was the debate between representatives of these traditions, unless we assume that Indians are congenitally incapable of thinking logically,. Those who sell this story, whether in India or abroad, the western savants and their Indian slaves, are the truly perfect imbeciles, which they actually think that Indians are. These idiots are our professors and many guru’s in India and elsewhere.&#xA;Thus, we see that Ambedkar and the Ambedkarites (in India and elsewhere today) are total slaves of their western masters. To ‘convert’ from ‘Hinduism’ to ‘Buddhism’, as though they are conflicting religions, is to simply ape the western cretins who have been selling this story for nearly 200 years. Of course, the Ambedkarites do that because their fame and fortune depends on slavery. They would rather be slaves of cretins than live free as thinking human beings. The western ‘thinkers’ in the US fete them because they love the adulation and adoration they get from these Indians. And, as is the case with Pollock, they are “friends with benefits” with Indians:  getting millions of dollars from idiots like Narayan Murthy and receiving national awards from the Indian government.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Is Sat explainable?</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/is-real-explainable/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;No, I cannot explain the real; nor has anybody else in the world. Even more radically: the Real can never be ‘explained’, nor will there be an explanatory theory, ever (that is what is meant by ‘providing an explanation’ or speak of explaining) about the real.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well, if the ‘Real’ comprises of “all these doctrines” then the Real is the world of ideas as distinct from the material and the mental world. Popper believed this to be the case, and called it the ‘third world’. You are, therefore, right on the spot when you call me ignorant. Yes, indeed, I did not know that Indians were Popperians &lt;em&gt;avant la letter&lt;/em&gt;: avant la letter, because Popper did it with a clarity and verve that Indians never attained. This is the second reason I do not want to wake up. ‘Awakening’ of the type you propagate is terribly depressing because the resultant ‘gyaanodaya’ is this: Buddha, Shankara, Ramanuja, Madva (to mention only a few names) merely “prepared” the advent of Sir Karl Popper, in exactly the same way all cultures in the world before Christ were merely ‘Praeparatione Evangelica’. I wish you, who appears to be a disciple of this new ‘praeparatione’ (the famous ‘Second Coming’?), the best of luck.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Assumptions, Warrants, Hypotheses and Heuristics</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/assumptions-warrants-hypotheses-heuristics/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;You say: &amp;ldquo;there seems to be an underlying assumption that all participants in the thread seem to be making. The assumption being that all these texts have the same end goal in mind, and that this end goal is enlightenment/eudaimonia/happiness. I submit that such an assumption is unwarranted.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It is not an assumption but an explicit hypothesis, as far as I am concerned, that all the Indian traditions (not just these two sets of texts, namely, Upanishads and Puranas) are concerned with the same end goal. I want to provide a description of the Indian traditions as attempts to help human beings find happiness on earth. (For the time being, in order to avoid fruitless controversies and to have a point of departure, I take Aristotelian Eudaimonia to be an explication of this notion of happiness.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Assumptions often do require warrant, but hypotheses do not. Because the truth of a conclusion depends on the truth of the premise (often, assumptions function as premises in an argument) provided valid rules of inferences are used, it makes sense to ask for the warrant of an assumption. Needless to say, this condition does not hold for hypotheses: you have to evaluate them entirely differently.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Of course, in one sense, such a reconstruction would be the hypothesis I propose. Until such stage, the belief about the commonality of the goal of the Indian traditions would be an assumption. However, it is not a premise in a logical deduction but one which functions as a heuristic. Consequently, if I need to convince you to accept this assumption for the time being, I need to show you what is cognitively interesting about this assumption.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It promises to help explain the rivalry within the Indian traditions; it sheds new light on the inter-relationship between them in a different way than as &amp;lsquo;syncretism&amp;rsquo;; it helps one look for a set of problems underlying the Indian traditions; it allows one to formulate these problems in the twenty-first century language; it helps one evaluate the answers of these traditions and even carry them forward. These are some of the cognitive benefits of this assumption.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Of course, ultimately, it might turn out to be the case that no such goal is to be found and that the Indian traditions are not each other&amp;rsquo;s rivals. I do not know. For the time being, this idea appears very productive. That is enough of a warrant.&#xA;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you want to use &lt;strong&gt;Nirvana Shatkam&lt;/strong&gt;*,* it might be more productive to choose translations which do the job that the text can. Because of that, a ‘faithful’ translation of Sanskrit into English is not the primary requirement; the process and the goal should determine how the words are best understood. With this in mind, some suggestions regarding the translation of the Sanskrit verses.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is important to notice that the words in these verses refer to components (physical, physiological, psychological, etc.). Therefore, assume that human ‘mind’ (or human psychology) is referred to (or spoken of) in modular terms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You claim that Jesus of Nazareth is a mystic. From the conversations so far, I presume that this is both your gut-feeling and conviction. The one deriving from your own mystical experience and the other because you find that mysticism, qua experience, does not distinguish between people on the basis of their color, creed, culture and country. I am perfectly willing to bow to authentic experience, but convictions? They need arguments and evidence, even if it is a subject as thorny as mystical experience. However, I will not ask you for your evidence but will try to present &lt;em&gt;counter-evidence&lt;/em&gt; to your conviction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editor&amp;rsquo;s note: This article appeared in the Journal of American Academy of Religion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The paper attempts a contrast between the process and the structure of the Christian and the Indian spirituality. Drawing attention to their dissimilarities, it attempts to reformulate the differences among the Indian traditions in a novel way. It argues that cultures and traditions are not just different; but that they differ from each other in different ways as well. The future of religious studies, it is suggested, is dependent on developing the ability to develop new ways of describing the differences between cultures and traditions. This is the agenda for the future. As a correlate to this task, the paper suggests that we replace the question &amp;ldquo;who speaks &amp;lsquo;for&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;about&amp;rsquo; a religion?&amp;rdquo; with a more pregnant and a more accurate reformulation: &amp;ldquo;how to speak for a religion in the Academy?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Sanskrit word (that I know) that comes closest to the Greek &amp;rsquo;telos&amp;rsquo; is &amp;lsquo;Sankalpa&amp;rsquo;. It means &amp;rsquo;to mentally determine&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;formulation of an end&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;desirous of (an end)&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;anticipation (of an end)&amp;rsquo; etc. It also means &amp;lsquo;Buddhi&amp;rsquo; in some contexts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the primary properties of religion is that it &lt;em&gt;generates&lt;/em&gt; questions about &amp;ldquo;the meaning and purpose of life&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;meaning and purpose of existence&amp;rdquo; and such like, both at an individual level and at the level of a culture.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I have often said, the most intriguing aspect of the Indian culture is the kind of knowledge it produced and encouraged people to produce: experiential knowledge which emerges by systematically reflecting on our (human) experiences in the world. As human beings, our experiences are many: no one set, no one kind of experience exhausts what we go through. From the purely personal experiences of the world (our ambitions, hopes, dreams, frustrations, etc) to the entirely social ones (the experiences of sorrow and injustice that other human beings in the world experience). So, knowledge that reflects on or thinks about and systematizes such experiences presupposes multiple learning sites, many diverse perspectives and varied kinds of intellectual skills.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/real-vs-existence/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;With some justifiable distortion, one can claim that the Indian Adhyatmic traditions revolve partially around some &amp;lsquo;philosophical&amp;rsquo; questions: what is real and what is existence? Is there a distinction between the two and, if yes, how to draw that line? This is a distortion because the debate never took this form; it is justifiable nonetheless to present it this way because it gives us a handle to tackle them today. However, we need to note that this is our way of posing the question, not theirs. Therefore, whether or not &amp;ldquo;believing&amp;rdquo; in Rama or Krishna entails the existence of such entities requires clarity about notions like &amp;rsquo;existence&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;belief&amp;rsquo; in the Indian traditions. I do not have this clarity and, only recently, I was told that the Indian intellectual traditions (in Sanskrit) do not have a word for &amp;lsquo;belief&amp;rsquo;. (It is as yet unclear to me what this implies: does it have the same force as the statement that Indians did not have a word for &amp;lsquo;gravitation&amp;rsquo; either or whether the notion of knowledge that we have is different from what we think knowledge is today.) Consequently, I cannot say much about this discussion today.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;(1) What is called &amp;lsquo;mysticism&amp;rsquo; in the western culture is not the same &lt;em&gt;kind&lt;/em&gt; of experience that the different Indian traditions talk about. (2) I do think, as a corollary, that to describe the Indian &amp;rsquo;enlightenment&amp;rsquo; (let me use this word temporarily, the scare quotes indicate my reservations) as &amp;lsquo;mysticism&amp;rsquo; is not to understand either. (3) There are different levels in and different ways to achieve &amp;rsquo;enlightenment&amp;rsquo;. (4) It is extremely important and significant that finitely different means to achieve this state have been worked out by each of these ways. I want to go further in exploring the significance of these points and in exploring this state of &amp;rsquo;enlightenment&amp;rsquo; that the Indian traditions talk about.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here is what I say in my article on &amp;lsquo;how to speak for the Indian traditions&amp;rsquo;: &amp;ldquo;Our middle-aged man is, thus, raising the question of Aristotle.&amp;ldquo;I have pursued many things in life. I have acquired wealth and status, and aimed with varying degrees of success to become powerful and famous. I have been successful in some of my endeavors, while failing in yet others. I thought these things would make me happy, but I discover that, apart from moments when I felt &amp;lsquo;good&amp;rsquo;, these projects have only made me unhappy. What should I do? How should I live?&amp;rdquo; Today, these questions are not a part of ethical enquiry, any more than a quest for eudemonia is: at best, these are the &amp;rsquo;esoteric&amp;rsquo; questions and quests of &amp;rsquo;exotic&amp;rsquo; religions; at worst, one raises them with one&amp;rsquo;s psychoanalyst during a &amp;lsquo;mid-life crisis&amp;rsquo;. This situation should already indicate the distance between what is called an &amp;rsquo;ethical enquiry&amp;rsquo; today, and what Aristotle thought was the subject of all such enquiries. But that is not the focus of this piece now. However, there is no need to confuse matters by continually drawing the distinction between &amp;lsquo;modern&amp;rsquo; ethics and &amp;lsquo;Aristotelian&amp;rsquo; ethics. So, let us follow the contemporary consensus and call the quest of our middle-aged man &amp;lsquo;spiritual&amp;rsquo; (from now on without scare quotes). Seeking spirituality, and not having found it in those objects that he once so passionately pursued, he is now raising a spiritual question: in fact, he is undergoing a spiritual crisis.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Achievements of Indology: Esoteric Indian traditions</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A science of cultures is not Atmagyaana or Brahmagyaana. Let me also add that I find a quest for happiness a normal human striving.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;According to the Indian traditions, experience itself is a state of being: anubhava. In my story, so is happiness (or atmasaakshaatkaara). Need one be enlightened in order to speak about enlightenment? Should that be the case, one cannot strive for enlightenment at all and I think that enlightenment (or happiness) is a legitimate goal for human beings. If happiness is not an esoteric state of being but a legitimate goal for all human beings, there are indefinitely many roads to that state of being. The strength of the Indian traditions lies not merely in recognizing this but also in working out many such routes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Is enlightenment learnable?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Is enlightenment learnable? (In a less loaded formulation: Can all people be happy?) My answer is an unequivocal &amp;lsquo;yes&amp;rsquo;. Before we go further, we need to be clear what exactly this sentence says: enlightenment is not, say, the result of some genes (that explains why we get molars and not tusks, for instance), nor is it a law of nature (that explains why, say, water boils when heated and does not become gold instead) and so on. While individual psychology (and the combination of the chromosomes in each individual) does have a certain role to play in our lives, they cannot explain why I learnt something (say, English) at all. At best, if we are able to develop our understanding to the extent that we can explain such questions, they could explain why I learnt English slowly or mastered in two weeks&amp;rsquo; time. To understand why I learnt English, you have to look elsewhere: at my biography and not into the structure of my genes. However, that I could learn a natural language at all might be explained by evolutionary biology one day. But its explanation, in such a case, will encompass all human beings. It is in this sense that I say that Enlightenment is learnable or that all human beings can be happy. (This is something that out traditions have always taught and I think they are right.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Introspection vs. reflection on experience—S.N.Balagangadhara</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this post, I want to reflect on what it means &lt;em&gt;to access and think&lt;/em&gt; about experience. Perhaps, not so much on what these words mean but what is entailed by (or what happens when we indulge in) this kind of activity. I think the best way to begin this analysis is by asking the following two questions about an activity familiar to most of us: what do we do when we think about ourselves? Do we do it the &amp;lsquo;right&amp;rsquo; way? Let me begin with the first question and postpone looking at the second for a later stage, including how we should understand it. Because most of us know how we think about ourselves most of the times, I will take a trivial example and skip over certain explanations and analyses. The holes in my reasoning can either be filled by our memories or by discussing them at a later stage.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How to go about developing an alternative to the so-called social sciences?  -- S.N. Balagangadhara</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I would like you to consider the following four &lt;em&gt;kinds&lt;/em&gt; of answers, each pitched at a different level of generality and at a different level of description. One could provide more, but these four should be enough to give a &lt;em&gt;taste&lt;/em&gt; of the kind of wine you might care to drink.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Suppose that one were to ask you: how to go about doing &amp;lsquo;science&amp;rsquo; (in general) or, say, doing &amp;lsquo;physics&amp;rsquo;? What kind of an answer could you possibly give? If you do not want to be unkind, you will probably give answers that will not be satisfying to the questioner. Like what? May be you will say: one needs to read, think about a problem, provide a solution and critically evaluate the hypothetical answer and so on. If the questioner presses his point and asks: yes, but &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; does one go about doing any of these, what will your answer be? The only reasonable answer you can give him is to point him in the direction of a &lt;em&gt;model&lt;/em&gt;: go, read that book on physics, you will perhaps say, and then you have an idea of what I am talking about.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
