      <description>&lt;p&gt;Increasingly, the phenomenon of terrorism has begun to occupy the media, politics, and the lives of people in different parts of the world. The more the attention, however, the less the clarity: what kind of a phenomenon is terrorism? What generates it, what sustains it, and what allows it to expand on an ever-increasing scale?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This lack of clarity has to do with the fact that our ideas about terrorism appear as an incoherent set. First, terrorism horrifies most of us; the acts of terrorists are seen as monstrous in scope and size. But the number of deaths or the human suffering, even if we look at an event as momentous as 9/11, is dwarfed by what traffic accidents and smoking do in any given year.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Disquieting Suggestion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&#xA;Arthur Danto, the well-known American philosopher, prefaced a book he wrote in the 70’s on oriental thought and moral philosophy titled &lt;em&gt;Mysticism and Morality&lt;/em&gt; with the following words:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The factual beliefs (that the civilizations of the East) take for granted are &amp;hellip;too alien to our (the West’s) representations of the World to be grafted on to it, and &lt;em&gt;in consequence their moral systems are unavailable to us&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;[ &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.philosophica.ugent.be/article/82484/galley/202298/view/&#34;&gt;Original&lt;/a&gt;, published  &lt;em&gt;Philosophica&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;40&lt;/strong&gt; (2): 77–107]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Introduction&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Should action sciences exist, it is obvious what they would have to study; the nature of human action, the kind of knowledge that actions generate, the process of learning to perform different types of action and so forth. Comparative anthropology, as a discipline, studies and contrasts, where such contrasts are possible, the different ways in which human beings organize their lives, think about and experience both themselves and world around them. A culture is a form of life and, as such, it is a way of going about the world. One would therefore expect to find a deep and intimate relation between action sciences on the one hand, and studies of culture on the other. A perusal of literature, however, shows the fact of the matter to be different.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Logic of normative ethics: Immorality</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Why does one bring up the issue of one&amp;rsquo;s grandmother&amp;rsquo;s judgment about a clerk taking bribes as a counter-example? First, what do I say? That he &lt;em&gt;calls&lt;/em&gt; it as corruption has to do with western normative ethics. Does it follow from this that the action of the municipal clerk is ethically &lt;em&gt;good?&lt;/em&gt; It does not, unless one assumes either (a) I am presenting an &lt;em&gt;alternate&lt;/em&gt; moral principle, which will make the action of the clerk morally good; or that (b) the only morality that will make the action of the clerk ethically bad is the one that construes it as corruption. I am not presenting an alternate moral rule that justifies the action of the clerk. But I want to know why the so-called corruption comes about and whether it is that. My attempt at doing this is &lt;em&gt;assumed&lt;/em&gt; to make the action of the clerk or the building contractor morally good. Why this assumption? I suggest that it comes about because of the assumption (b).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Ethically Bad Action vs. Corruption—S.N.Balagangadhara</title>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The &amp;lsquo;corruption&amp;rsquo; refers to the social phenomenon in India which makes about 20% of the adult population into immoral people. When I said that I refuse to call the clerk &amp;lsquo;corrupt&amp;rsquo; or that the issue I raise is anterior, I am talking about this phenomenon. One uses the word &amp;lsquo;cheating&amp;rsquo; (something like the Hindi &amp;lsquo;Dhoka&amp;rsquo; probably). One could, for instance, use this word to describe the individual action of the clerk as an unethical one without &lt;em&gt;making&lt;/em&gt; it into corruption.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Are these two conversationally synonymous? I suppose it depends on the person with whom you are having a conversation, the context and the language used.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Colonial Consciousness: Burden of Proof</title>
      <link>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/colonial-consciousness-burden-of-proof-s-n-balagangadhara/</link>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The first thing that is really striking involves what I will call the &lt;em&gt;burden of proof&lt;/em&gt;. That is, I am being asked to prove that my assertions about corruption are true. In one sense, it appears an entirely reasonable demand to make: after all, one should not entertain gratuitous claims. But what seems to have escaped the attention of many is this: what precisely do I have to prove? Who has the burden of proof?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1.1. Let us strip the issue to its barest form. I am supposed to prove that we Indians are not corrupt, immoral and/or moral imbeciles. Without proof, is it difficult to accept these claims? But who has proved that we are any or all of these things? Not the western theorists, surely. Not any Indian either. All that exist are bare-bone assertions that some moral principles are violated in a systematic fashion in India. So, what exactly do I have to prove?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Colonial Consciousness: The Logic of “India is Corrupt”</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(A)&lt;/strong&gt; Consider the following sequence of sentences:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;All Indians are perfectly and fully moral.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;All westerners are perfectly fully moral.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;All Indians are immoral.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;All westerners are immoral.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For sentences (1) and (2), all it takes is one instance of immorality to be proven wrong. Our proverbial municipal clerk would be immoral, and it would disprove the sentence (1). The same example could also confirm sentence (3); an instance of a moral act would also be a counter-example.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>On Colonial Experience and the Indian Renaissance: A prolegomenon to a Project—S.N. Balagangadhara</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the striking things about the British colonial rule is its success in developing certain ways of talking about the Indian culture and society. The British criticised the Indian &amp;lsquo;religions&amp;rsquo;, the Indian &amp;lsquo;caste system&amp;rsquo;, the Indian education system, practices like &amp;lsquo;sati&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;untouchability&amp;rsquo;, and so on and so forth. They redrew the outlines of Indian intellectual history as indigenous responses to some of the ills they saw in the Indian society and culture: for example, &amp;lsquo;Buddhism&amp;rsquo;, as it emerged out of their reconstruction, was a revolt against &amp;lsquo;Brahmanism&amp;rsquo; and &amp;rsquo;the caste system&amp;rsquo;. Many Indian intellectuals emphasized British criticism by making &amp;rsquo;truths&amp;rsquo; in the latter their own: the Arya Samaj, the Brahmo Samaj, many Hindu &amp;lsquo;reform&amp;rsquo; movements, and so on exemplify this trend. I say &amp;rsquo;truths&amp;rsquo; and place it in scare quotes because the &lt;em&gt;unbroken line of continuity&lt;/em&gt; between the colonial period and the one following the Indian independence raises two &lt;em&gt;kinds&lt;/em&gt; of questions. The first is this: would there have been such a line of continuity if there was no &amp;rsquo;truth&amp;rsquo; to the British portrayal of our history, traditions, and culture? This question uses the &amp;lsquo;fact&amp;rsquo; of continuity to suggest that the British descriptions &lt;em&gt;could be &amp;rsquo;true&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/em&gt; That is, our current experience of our culture and society appears to lend truth-value to the colonial descriptions of India. The second question transforms our &amp;lsquo;current experience&amp;rsquo; itself into a problem: does such a line of continuity indicate that our experiences themselves are still colonial in nature? This question throws doubts upon the &amp;lsquo;facticity&amp;rsquo; of the British descriptions of India, and suggests that they &lt;em&gt;could be &amp;lsquo;untrue&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/em&gt; In the process, it also challenges us to look more closely and investigate our own experiences today. That is, the second question withholds assent to the &amp;rsquo;truth&amp;rsquo; &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; of the colonial descriptions of India and of some of the claims we make about our experiences of our culture and society today. To some extent, and only to some extent, the so-called &amp;lsquo;post-colonial&amp;rsquo; writings can be seen as attempts to make sense of the second question. Even though I do not fancy the label of being a &amp;lsquo;post-colonial&amp;rsquo; myself, I perceive a shared sense of a quest with them. &lt;em&gt;There is something deeply, deeply wrong with the line of continuity that exists between the colonial period and today&amp;rsquo;s India,&lt;/em&gt; and the challenge is to say what it is.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
