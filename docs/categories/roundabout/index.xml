      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Symbolic interpretation of lingam from a netizen&lt;/strong&gt;: &amp;ldquo;In ancient India, there was a fertility cult; our ancestors &lt;em&gt;knew&lt;/em&gt; that it was a fertility cult; Lingam was a symbol for the phallus then; it continues to be one even when many millions are ignorant of this now; and that the Modern Indians&amp;rsquo; attitude to sex is inhibiting because of which they do not see the symbolism.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To keep the contrast between us stark, here is what I say: Lingam is not a symbol of anything or anybody. Lingam is &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; Shiva&amp;rsquo;s puja is done (as against, say, how we do puja to Vishnu) by the Indians. You tell me that this &lt;em&gt;factual claim&lt;/em&gt; is wrong and that by saying what I have just said, I project my present to &amp;rsquo;explain&amp;rsquo; the past. Very well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
