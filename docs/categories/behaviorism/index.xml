It is to waste of time I do not have. Let me very briefly state where I stand with respect to that discipline. In its early days, it was useful in providing some insights into animal behavior. I share the dominant consensus regarding its status today: it is obsolete. It does not quite have the status of &amp;lsquo;phlogiston theory&amp;rsquo; but it is pretty close to the latter. I have suffered through many writings of Skinner and his disciples, but I have neither the time nor the interest to discuss their &amp;rsquo;theories&amp;rsquo; now. This means, I am going to skip over issues involving &amp;lsquo;shaping&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;conditioning&amp;rsquo; and such like.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
