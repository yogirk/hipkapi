Now, the answer has to satisfy certain conditions because the question also meets certain conditions. Let me say very clearly what all these are, so that the playground and the rules are transparent and favour no one party in the dispute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I propose we accept the best theory of meaning that exists in the market place. As far as I know, the book that plays this role most admirably, while satisfying the proponents of different theories of meaning expounded during the last century or so, is Prashant Parikh&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Language and Equilibrium&amp;rdquo; (The MIT press, 2010). His formal apparatus allows for the existence of &amp;lsquo;word meanings&amp;rsquo; without sacrificing the idea that the meaning of sentences are context-dependent and makes sense of even such statements as &amp;ldquo;the meaning of red light is&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; That is to say, it does not restrict &amp;lsquo;meaning&amp;rsquo; to words and sentences alone; it also allows us to deal with &amp;lsquo;word meaning&amp;rsquo; as well, as it is in our case. If my colleagues unanimously prefer another &amp;rsquo;theory of meaning&amp;rsquo;, I would like to know what it is. In all probability, I would not take issue with an alternate choice.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Religious Intolerance and Believers</title><link>https://yogirk.github.io/hipkapi/posts/believers-vs-their-religion/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2014 21:15:50 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://yogirk.github.io/hipkapi/posts/believers-vs-their-religion/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;There are two distinct problems: one involving religions (like Christianity, Judaism and Islam) and the other involving the believers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding these three religions: (a) insofar as these religions (Judaism, Christianity and Islam) are concerned, Hinduism is demonic. It is that because, according to all the three religions, &amp;lsquo;Hindus&amp;rsquo; worship the devil (&amp;lsquo;shaitan&amp;rsquo;) and his minions. That is to say, our Rama, Vishnu, Ganesha, Saraswathi, etc. are all lieutenants of the devil himself. The idols, according to their theology, are representations of the devil, and Pat Robertson is simply echoing this standard Christian (Judaic, and Islamic) doctrines. There is nothing &amp;rsquo;extremist&amp;rsquo; about this statement: it is, as I say, one of the basic claims of these three religions. Because we worship the devil, they are convinced, we will all go to hell (do not confuse this with our naraka) for eternity. Because they want to save souls, these religions want to convert others into &amp;lsquo;believers&amp;rsquo;. (By the way, the &amp;lsquo;jealous&amp;rsquo; God is God of the Jews - God of Israel - in one of the more known aspects from the Old Testament Bible. In the New Testament, God is supposed to be &amp;rsquo;loving&amp;rsquo;. If you want to irk a Jew just tell him that his God is jealous and punishing, whereas God of Christianity is loving.)&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Devil worship in 'Hinduism'</title><link>https://yogirk.github.io/hipkapi/posts/devil-worship-in-hinduism/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2014 00:01:53 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://yogirk.github.io/hipkapi/posts/devil-worship-in-hinduism/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Here goes: that &amp;lsquo;Hindu&amp;rsquo; religion is devil&amp;rsquo;s worship is central, crucial and vital to the religions that Judaism, Christianity and Islam are. &amp;lsquo;Why is that?&amp;rsquo;, you may ask. It is impossible to cover this question in the space of a post, and with the details the question demands. So, here is what can be done: (a) I will provide a very crude outline with respect to Christianity; (b) reread what &lt;a href="https://yogirk.github.io/hipkapi/posts/belief-vs-faith/"&gt;I wrote about God and devil .&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Belief vs Faith</title><link>https://yogirk.github.io/hipkapi/posts/belief-vs-faith/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Mar 2014 23:50:22 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://yogirk.github.io/hipkapi/posts/belief-vs-faith/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;(a) It appears to me that in these discussions, a very vital issue (if we want to talk about Judaism, Christianity and Islam, and their &amp;lsquo;problems&amp;rsquo; with &amp;lsquo;Hinduism&amp;rsquo;, etc) is not being recognized. and that is this: religious &amp;lsquo;beliefs&amp;rsquo; are not accorded their place, and are talked about as though they are merely a subset of the class of &amp;lsquo;beliefs&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(b) &amp;lsquo;Being a believer&amp;rsquo; (I will confine myself to Christianity for the sake of brevity) does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; mean assenting to the proposition that &amp;lsquo;God exists&amp;rsquo;. For, if this is what it would mean, then the Devil himself is the first believer: after all, he does accept it as true that God exists. (The Devil is not an atheist, mind you.) He knows that God exists: after all, he rebelled against him! As the new testament Bible puts it: &amp;ldquo;thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble.&amp;rdquo; (James 2: 26)&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Creation: Spontaneous or Intentional</title><link>https://yogirk.github.io/hipkapi/posts/do-indian-traditions-claim-that-the-universe-is-an-expression-of-gods-intention/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Oct 2011 22:10:37 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://yogirk.github.io/hipkapi/posts/do-indian-traditions-claim-that-the-universe-is-an-expression-of-gods-intention/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;If we want to grasp the nature of the discussions in the Indian traditions, there is much we need to do beforehand: (a) identify the entity they were talking about; (b) identify the specific questions they were answering; (c) identify the generic questions that defined both the outlines of the acceptable answers and the formulation of the specific questions; etc. (The &amp;lsquo;cetera&amp;rsquo; indicates that I do not know how to enumerate all the things we need to grasp.) In the case of the propositions you have formulated, I assume that &amp;lsquo;God&amp;rsquo; is Vishnu (or even Krishna) and not, say, Shiva or Brahma because you are talking about the Madhvas. However, to keep the discussion faithful to your formulations, I will use the word &amp;lsquo;God&amp;rsquo; to refer to Vishnu.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>God, Devil (Satan), and Polytheism</title><link>https://yogirk.github.io/hipkapi/posts/god-devilsatan-and-polytheism-s-n-balagangadhara/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Mar 2011 02:47:08 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://yogirk.github.io/hipkapi/posts/god-devilsatan-and-polytheism-s-n-balagangadhara/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;It is true that the modern Jewish thought, which is more influenced by the Rabbinic than by apocalyptic or Qumranic literature, places less emphasis on the Devil. Rabbinic Judaism was less interested in building a demonology than others. It is one thing to say this, but quite another to say that the Judaic tradition knows of the Devil only in terms of the psychological &amp;lsquo;inclinations&amp;rsquo; in man. (It is equivalent to suggesting that there is no demonology in Judaic thought, a preposterous suggestion on any count.) Belial, Mastema, Azazel, Satanail, Sammael, Semyzza, or Satan do not name either psychological or spiritual &amp;lsquo;inclinations&amp;rsquo;, surely. (Think further of what Behemoth, Leviathan, etc. are). The Satan in the Book of Job is already an emissary of God (though not yet the personification of evil), and not a mere &amp;lsquo;inclination&amp;rsquo;. The Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs name Belial or Satan as Chief of evil angels commanding the spirits of wrath, hatred, etc. and as lord of war, fornication, bloodshed, destruction, etc. He tempts and seduces humankind to error.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
