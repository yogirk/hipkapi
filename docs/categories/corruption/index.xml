Conflict in duties does not give you a moral dilemma. For a moral dilemma to occur two necessary conditions must exist: the prescribed set of duties must be logically consistent by virtue of which one is obliged to perform them all.  A dilemma pertains to a situation where one has an obligation to do A and an obligation to do B; but can in fact do only one. It is the perfect consistency of the system of duty that gives rise to the dilemma: a choice between A and B, between a banana and an orange is not a dilemma. It becomes a dilemma when you want both and can have only one. So, a moral dilemma cannot possibly describe a conflict of duties if one uses the word ‘duty’ here.  A conflict of &lt;em&gt;dharmas&lt;/em&gt; is not a dilemma at all.
What I mean by decolonizing social Sciences is very simple thing. There are many domains today: sociology, political science, psychology, and anthropology that call themselves social sciences as distinct from humanities. So, I am not talking about decolonizing science in the specific sense given by Mohini Mullick. I do not consider the theories in these domains which call themselves social sciences to be science at all. Today, I see all of them without exception as ideologies. I call my project ‘Comparative Science of Culture’ because existing theories are not social sciences.
For instance: political corruption refers to the act of an individual public servant who is part of a state or a government and who acts against the public interest of the people or the interest of the state. Because state has an interest which coincides with the interest of the society, then any action that supports an individual’s interest is morally wrong. This is the meaning of political corruption.
I am very conservative. I want a scientific hypothesis in the sense that it solves a problem, has an explanatory potential and there is some way to test it. In this sense, political theory is completely bankrupt. I proffer two hypotheses which at least minimally do what you expect a hypothesis to do.
The first is purely historical in nature. You raised a question about the moral evaluations which comes from a completely Western ethics and is not Indian at all. We in India had our own forms of social organization. We had certain indigenous ways of governing, of organizing production. But with colonization came industrialization, bringing with it management institutions from the West; structures were imposed on native Indian industries, on native structures, which today are taught in MBA courses all over India. The result is institutional distortion, so that you come across extraordinary things that baffle management theorists.
More concretely: how were questions asked about tradition? Can we use the resources of our ancient Indian literature to tackle and explain this problem? I find the Indian tradition powerful because it can help generate scientific hypotheses beyond the reach of Western social scientists. That’s why I am against the latter, not because they are Western. I am not against everything Western: Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, Biology come from the Western tradition.

&lt;p&gt;Actually I&amp;rsquo;m the odd man out. We have success stories. We have spiritual leaders; we have an extraordinarily organizational leader in front of us. And now I have to do an exam. You see, normally I take exams in the university. Now I have to do an exam. The exam is this I must move you from these wonderful stories, success stories, good stories, to a rather depressing story. The question is how can I do it and still catch your attention. I don&amp;rsquo;t know. After the exam, tell me please whether I&amp;rsquo;ve succeeded or failed.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>What is normative about Corruption being a hindrance to development?</title><link>https://yogirk.github.io/hipkapi/posts/what-is-normative-about-corruption-being-a-hindrance-to-development/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Mar 2011 21:02:41 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://yogirk.github.io/hipkapi/posts/what-is-normative-about-corruption-being-a-hindrance-to-development/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;While translating Russell L. Ackoff, you say that such a translation is &amp;ldquo;not a moral judgment now, but a statement about the state of the economy&amp;rdquo;. But your claim, according to Ackoff&amp;rsquo;s own argument, is untrue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider how he describes corruption: &amp;ldquo;We concluded that corruption occurs when one party, A (for example, a policeman), who has an obligation to a second party, B (for example, the government), to provide service to a third party, C (for example, a member of the public), serves C in such a way as to benefit A more than he or she is supposed to. In addition, anyone who induces another to behave corruptly is corrupt. Therefore, corruption is the exploitation for one&amp;rsquo;s personal benefit of a position in which one is expected to serve others.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B (the policeman) has an obligation to serve C (a member of the public) and this obligation is a moral obligation; A has a derived moral obligation to serve C because A is under the moral obligation to do what B (the government) expects him to. A violates his moral obligation to B because as a part of B, he serves C in such a way that A benefits more, that is, A&amp;rsquo;s (moral) abuse of his position makes him receive more benefits than he morally deserves. (What A deserves by virtue is serving C is a moral reward.) In this sense, Ackoff is making a moral claim.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Logic of normative ethics: Immorality</title><link>https://yogirk.github.io/hipkapi/posts/logic-of-normative-ethics-immorality-s-n-balagangadhara/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Mar 2011 04:16:56 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://yogirk.github.io/hipkapi/posts/logic-of-normative-ethics-immorality-s-n-balagangadhara/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Why does one bring up the issue of one&amp;rsquo;s grandmother&amp;rsquo;s judgment about a clerk taking bribes as a counter-example? First, what do I say? That he &lt;em&gt;calls&lt;/em&gt; it as corruption has to do with western normative ethics. Does it follow from this that the action of the municipal clerk is ethically &lt;em&gt;good?&lt;/em&gt; It does not, unless one assumes either (a) I am presenting an &lt;em&gt;alternate&lt;/em&gt; moral principle, which will make the action of the clerk morally good; or that (b) the only morality that will make the action of the clerk ethically bad is the one that construes it as corruption. I am not presenting an alternate moral rule that justifies the action of the clerk. But I want to know why the so-called corruption comes about and whether it is that. My attempt at doing this is &lt;em&gt;assumed&lt;/em&gt; to make the action of the clerk or the building contractor morally good. Why this assumption? I suggest that it comes about because of the assumption (b).&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Ethically Bad Action vs. Corruption—S.N.Balagangadhara</title><link>https://yogirk.github.io/hipkapi/posts/ethically-bad-action-vs-corruption-s-n-balagangadhara/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Mar 2011 01:57:35 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://yogirk.github.io/hipkapi/posts/ethically-bad-action-vs-corruption-s-n-balagangadhara/</guid><description>&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &amp;lsquo;corruption&amp;rsquo; refers to the social phenomenon in India which makes about 20% of the adult population into immoral people. When I said that I refuse to call the clerk &amp;lsquo;corrupt&amp;rsquo; or that the issue I raise is anterior, I am talking about this phenomenon. One uses the word &amp;lsquo;cheating&amp;rsquo; (something like the Hindi &amp;lsquo;Dhoka&amp;rsquo; probably). One could, for instance, use this word to describe the individual action of the clerk as an unethical one without &lt;em&gt;making&lt;/em&gt; it into corruption.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are these two conversationally synonymous? I suppose it depends on the person with whom you are having a conversation, the context and the language used.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Normative assumptions and Corruption</title><link>https://yogirk.github.io/hipkapi/posts/on-assumptions-that-make-actions-corrupt-s-n-balagangadhara/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Mar 2011 01:17:20 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://yogirk.github.io/hipkapi/posts/on-assumptions-that-make-actions-corrupt-s-n-balagangadhara/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The first thing to note is that there is no distance between how we use corruption in our daily language and the way it is used in political and sociological theories of corruption. You see, the problem we (Indians) face is the asymmetry &lt;em&gt;in the way the word is used&lt;/em&gt; while talking about us and the way it is used when talking about India. I want to signal this by putting up the red flag: I want to suggest the reader not to assume the truth of these descriptions.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Normative Ethics: Moral Dilemmas and Imperfect World</title><link>https://yogirk.github.io/hipkapi/posts/normative-ethics-moral-dilemmas-and-imperfect-world-s-n-balagangadhara/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Mar 2011 00:43:58 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://yogirk.github.io/hipkapi/posts/normative-ethics-moral-dilemmas-and-imperfect-world-s-n-balagangadhara/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Let us say that &amp;lsquo;X&amp;rsquo; does something which &amp;lsquo;Y&amp;rsquo; considers corrupt. To keep it simple, let us say that &amp;lsquo;Y&amp;rsquo; expresses the aforementioned judgment. In order to express it, or persuade others about the validity of this moral judgment, &amp;lsquo;Y&amp;rsquo; will have to do something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Y defines &amp;lsquo;corruption&amp;rsquo;: &amp;ldquo;All actions which exhibit _______ properties are corrupt&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Y&amp;rsquo;s &amp;rsquo;ethical principle&amp;rsquo; (itself justified): &amp;ldquo;All actions which satisfy ______ (the principle) are moral&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Colonial Consciousness: Burden of Proof</title><link>https://yogirk.github.io/hipkapi/posts/colonial-consciousness-burden-of-proof-s-n-balagangadhara/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Mar 2011 00:22:40 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://yogirk.github.io/hipkapi/posts/colonial-consciousness-burden-of-proof-s-n-balagangadhara/</guid><description>&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first thing that is really striking involves what I will call the &lt;em&gt;burden of proof&lt;/em&gt;. That is, I am being asked to prove that my assertions about corruption are true. In one sense, it appears an entirely reasonable demand to make: after all, one should not entertain gratuitous claims. But what seems to have escaped the attention of many is this: what precisely do I have to prove? Who has the burden of proof?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.1. Let us strip the issue to its barest form. I am supposed to prove that we Indians are not corrupt, immoral and/or moral imbeciles. Without proof, is it difficult to accept these claims? But who has proved that we are any or all of these things? Not the western theorists, surely. Not any Indian either. All that exist are bare-bone assertions that some moral principles are violated in a systematic fashion in India. So, what exactly do I have to prove?&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Colonial Consciousness: The Logic of “India is Corrupt”</title><link>https://yogirk.github.io/hipkapi/posts/colonial-consciousness-and-the-logic-of-india-is-corrupt-s-n-balagangadhara/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Mar 2011 22:17:32 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://yogirk.github.io/hipkapi/posts/colonial-consciousness-and-the-logic-of-india-is-corrupt-s-n-balagangadhara/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(A)&lt;/strong&gt; Consider the following sequence of sentences:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All Indians are perfectly and fully moral.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All westerners are perfectly fully moral.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All Indians are immoral.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All westerners are immoral.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For sentences (1) and (2), all it takes is one instance of immorality to be proven wrong. Our proverbial municipal clerk would be immoral, and it would disprove the sentence (1). The same example could also confirm sentence (3); an instance of a moral act would also be a counter-example.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>On Colonial Experience and the Indian Renaissance: A prolegomenon to a Project—S.N. Balagangadhara</title><link>https://yogirk.github.io/hipkapi/posts/on-colonial-experience-and-the-indian-renaissance-a-prolegomenon-to-a-project-s-n-balagangadhara/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Mar 2011 21:43:25 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://yogirk.github.io/hipkapi/posts/on-colonial-experience-and-the-indian-renaissance-a-prolegomenon-to-a-project-s-n-balagangadhara/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;One of the striking things about the British colonial rule is its success in developing certain ways of talking about the Indian culture and society. The British criticised the Indian &amp;lsquo;religions&amp;rsquo;, the Indian &amp;lsquo;caste system&amp;rsquo;, the Indian education system, practices like &amp;lsquo;sati&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;untouchability&amp;rsquo;, and so on and so forth. They redrew the outlines of Indian intellectual history as indigenous responses to some of the ills they saw in the Indian society and culture: for example, &amp;lsquo;Buddhism&amp;rsquo;, as it emerged out of their reconstruction, was a revolt against &amp;lsquo;Brahmanism&amp;rsquo; and &amp;rsquo;the caste system&amp;rsquo;. Many Indian intellectuals emphasized British criticism by making &amp;rsquo;truths&amp;rsquo; in the latter their own: the Arya Samaj, the Brahmo Samaj, many Hindu &amp;lsquo;reform&amp;rsquo; movements, and so on exemplify this trend. I say &amp;rsquo;truths&amp;rsquo; and place it in scare quotes because the &lt;em&gt;unbroken line of continuity&lt;/em&gt; between the colonial period and the one following the Indian independence raises two &lt;em&gt;kinds&lt;/em&gt; of questions. The first is this: would there have been such a line of continuity if there was no &amp;rsquo;truth&amp;rsquo; to the British portrayal of our history, traditions, and culture? This question uses the &amp;lsquo;fact&amp;rsquo; of continuity to suggest that the British descriptions &lt;em&gt;could be &amp;rsquo;true&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/em&gt; That is, our current experience of our culture and society appears to lend truth-value to the colonial descriptions of India. The second question transforms our &amp;lsquo;current experience&amp;rsquo; itself into a problem: does such a line of continuity indicate that our experiences themselves are still colonial in nature? This question throws doubts upon the &amp;lsquo;facticity&amp;rsquo; of the British descriptions of India, and suggests that they &lt;em&gt;could be &amp;lsquo;untrue&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/em&gt; In the process, it also challenges us to look more closely and investigate our own experiences today. That is, the second question withholds assent to the &amp;rsquo;truth&amp;rsquo; &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; of the colonial descriptions of India and of some of the claims we make about our experiences of our culture and society today. To some extent, and only to some extent, the so-called &amp;lsquo;post-colonial&amp;rsquo; writings can be seen as attempts to make sense of the second question. Even though I do not fancy the label of being a &amp;lsquo;post-colonial&amp;rsquo; myself, I perceive a shared sense of a quest with them. &lt;em&gt;There is something deeply, deeply wrong with the line of continuity that exists between the colonial period and today&amp;rsquo;s India,&lt;/em&gt; and the challenge is to say what it is.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
