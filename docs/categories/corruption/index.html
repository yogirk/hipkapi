hipkapi</span></div></header><div class=post-excerpt><p>Let us take the word ‘duty’ for the moment. Conflict in duties does not give you a moral dilemma. For a moral dilemma to occur two necessary conditions must exist: the prescribed set of duties must be logically consistent by virtue of which one is obliged to perform them all.  A dilemma pertains to a situation where one has an obligation to do A and an obligation to do B; but can in fact do only one. It is the perfect consistency of the system of duty that gives rise to the dilemma: a choice between A and B, between a banana and an orange is not a dilemma. It becomes a dilemma when you want both and can have only one. So, a moral dilemma cannot possibly describe a conflict of duties if one uses the word ‘duty’ here.  A conflict of <em>dharmas</em> is not a dilemma at all.
What I mean by decolonizing social Sciences is very simple thing. There are many domains today: sociology, political science, psychology, and anthropology that call themselves social sciences as distinct from humanities. So, I am not talking about decolonizing science in the specific sense given by Mohini Mullick. I do not consider the theories in these domains which call themselves social sciences to be science at all. Today, I see all of them without exception as ideologies. I call my project ‘Comparative Science of Culture’ because existing theories are not social sciences.
For instance: political corruption refers to the act of an individual public servant who is part of a state or a government and who acts against the public interest of the people or the interest of the state. Because state has an interest which coincides with the interest of the society, then any action that supports an individual’s interest is morally wrong. This is the meaning of political corruption.
I am very conservative. I want a scientific hypothesis in the sense that it solves a problem, has an explanatory potential and there is some way to test it. In this sense, political theory is completely bankrupt. I proffer two hypotheses which at least minimally do what you expect a hypothesis to do.
The first is purely historical in nature. You raised a question about the moral evaluations which comes from a completely Western ethics and is not Indian at all. We in India had our own forms of social organization. We had certain indigenous ways of governing, of organizing production. But with colonization came industrialization, bringing with it management institutions from the West; structures were imposed on native Indian industries, on native structures, which today are taught in MBA courses all over India. The result is institutional distortion, so that you come across extraordinary things that baffle management theorists.
More concretely: how were questions asked about tradition? Can we use the resources of our ancient Indian literature to tackle and explain this problem? I find the Indian tradition powerful because it can help generate scientific hypotheses beyond the reach of Western social scientists. That’s why I am against the latter, not because they are Western. I am not against everything Western: Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, Biology come from the Western tradition.

In addition, anyone who induces another to behave corruptly is corrupt. Therefore, corruption is the exploitation for one&rsquo;s personal benefit of a position in which one is expected to serve others.&rdquo;</li></ol><p>B (the policeman) has an obligation to serve C (a member of the public) and this obligation is a moral obligation; A has a derived moral obligation to serve C because A is under the moral obligation to do what B (the government) expects him to. A violates his moral obligation to B because as a part of B, he serves C in such a way that A benefits more, that is, A&rsquo;s (moral) abuse of his position makes him receive more benefits than he morally deserves.

hipkapi</span></div></header><div class=post-excerpt><p>One of the striking things about the British colonial rule is its success in developing certain ways of talking about the Indian culture and society. The British criticised the Indian &lsquo;religions&rsquo;, the Indian &lsquo;caste system&rsquo;, the Indian education system, practices like &lsquo;sati&rsquo; and &lsquo;untouchability&rsquo;, and so on and so forth. They redrew the outlines of Indian intellectual history as indigenous responses to some of the ills they saw in the Indian society and culture: for example, &lsquo;Buddhism&rsquo;, as it emerged out of their reconstruction, was a revolt against &lsquo;Brahmanism&rsquo; and &rsquo;the caste system&rsquo;. Many Indian intellectuals emphasized British criticism by making &rsquo;truths&rsquo; in the latter their own: the Arya Samaj, the Brahmo Samaj, many Hindu &lsquo;reform&rsquo; movements, and so on exemplify this trend. I say &rsquo;truths&rsquo; and place it in scare quotes because the <em>unbroken line of continuity</em> between the colonial period and the one following the Indian independence raises two <em>kinds</em> of questions. The first is this: would there have been such a line of continuity if there was no &rsquo;truth&rsquo; to the British portrayal of our history, traditions, and culture? This question uses the &lsquo;fact&rsquo; of continuity to suggest that the British descriptions <em>could be &rsquo;true&rsquo;.</em> That is, our current experience of our culture and society appears to lend truth-value to the colonial descriptions of India. The second question transforms our &lsquo;current experience&rsquo; itself into a problem: does such a line of continuity indicate that our experiences themselves are still colonial in nature? This question throws doubts upon the &lsquo;facticity&rsquo; of the British descriptions of India, and suggests that they <em>could be &lsquo;untrue&rsquo;.</em> In the process, it also challenges us to look more closely and investigate our own experiences today. That is, the second question withholds assent to the &rsquo;truth&rsquo; <em>both</em> of the colonial descriptions of India and of some of the claims we make about our experiences of our culture and society today. To some extent, and only to some extent, the so-called &lsquo;post-colonial&rsquo; writings can be seen as attempts to make sense of the second question. Even though I do not fancy the label of being a &lsquo;post-colonial&rsquo; myself, I perceive a shared sense of a quest with them. <em>There is something deeply, deeply wrong with the line of continuity that exists between the colonial period and today&rsquo;s India,</em> and the challenge is to say what it is.</p></div><footer class=card-footer><div class=compact-post-categories><a href=/hipkapi/categories/balagangadhara/ class=compact-post-category>Balagangadhara</a>
