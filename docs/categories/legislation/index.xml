&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In both the theory of rights and in discussions about liberty (or freedom), the following two ways of conceptualizing the issues have been present. One could see rights as an &amp;ldquo;ability or power or capacity&amp;rdquo; to do something (this is called &amp;ldquo;active rights&amp;rdquo;) or as a &amp;ldquo;duty someone else has towards the rights subject&amp;rdquo; (called the &amp;ldquo;passive rights&amp;rdquo;). Equally, liberty has been conceptualized &amp;lsquo;positively&amp;rsquo; (as one&amp;rsquo;s capacity) or &amp;rsquo;negatively&amp;rsquo; (what the other should not do to you). Any good introduction to the theory of rights or theory of liberty will provide you with the details you require as well as the limitations of these two conceptualizations.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
