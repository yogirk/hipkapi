      <title>Experience and truth</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Of course, you can use Kant (or anyone other philosopher of your liking) to talk about what experience is. But if you use these thinkers (of the last 1000 years or so) to think about experience, you will be trapped in a set of problems: (a) you will have to talk about sensory input (no matter what technical term you use here), which cognition works on; (b) the world as something that provides these inputs; (c) distinguishing subjectivity and objectivity of the perception of the world accordingly and so on. Ultimately, truth becomes the final arbiter of everything.&#xA;In contrast stands Indian thinking that talks about ‘forms’ (Rupa, Rasa, Sparsha, Sabda, Gandha etc) that interact with our abilities (that includes cognition as a part) and about how this world of forms interacts with us. This leads to our notion(s) of experience. In this case, we do not talk about indoctrination but about learning and changing the processes of learning.&#xA;I have decided to take the second route because it helps me find solutions to problems. The first route blocks even the noticing that there are problems.&#xA;Of course, I have not yet written out even the outlines of the second route, whereas the first has many champions over the last 500 years. To outline the second route absorbing what cognitive sciences and multiple psychologies (not to speak of biology) tell us about ourselves is a huge undertaking, which I cannot possibly complete before I die. Yet.&#xA; &#xA;p112&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Akrasia and Will</title>
      <link>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/akrasia-and-will/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/akrasia-and-will/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;To begin with, it is a matter of scholarly consensus among Classicists and philosophers that the concept of &amp;ldquo;Will&amp;rdquo; was absent from Greek thought and that St. Augustine was the first to develop it. Aristotle, for instance, had the notion of practical cognition and not &amp;lsquo;will&amp;rsquo;. &amp;ldquo;Akrasia&amp;rdquo; can only be loosely translated as &amp;ldquo;weakness of the will&amp;rdquo; simply because we do not quite know how to translate it otherwise.&#xA;X says: Isn&amp;rsquo;t that  basically a faculty of volition, something that is the first thing one learns to express in any language?&#xA;In so far as this sentence is about psychology, you do not have a clue either about its history or where it is today. In the Middle Ages in Europe, one spoke about a &amp;ldquo;faculty of Volition&amp;rdquo; as a part of human psychological makeup. Today, no psychologist (from any research programme) speaks in terms of &amp;ldquo;faculty psychology&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Psychological Traits and Enlightenment: Ignorance and Knowledge</title>
      <link>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/ignorance-knowledge-psychological-traits-and-enlightenment/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/ignorance-knowledge-psychological-traits-and-enlightenment/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;About the relationship between scientific knowledge and enlightenment: If every human being can become enlightened (at any time, place or culture), it logically follows that some or another hypothesis about the world cannot be a requirement to become enlightened. People were enlightened (in the past) without possessing knowledge that humankind has today; one can become enlightened without being a physicist or a geneticist; one can believe in the existence of ghosts and spirits and still be enlightened… and so on. In the same way one can seek and find enlightenment while believing that human body is composed of five sheaths, one can also become enlightened by dismissing the idea of five sheaths as a false and primitive belief. There is, however, a caveat that ties knowledge to enlightenment. Perhaps, a contemporary example would help here.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Secular theme: cognitive stages of development -- concrete vs abstract</title>
      <link>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/secular-theme-cognitive-stages-of-development-concrete-vs-abstract/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/secular-theme-cognitive-stages-of-development-concrete-vs-abstract/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The religious idea I am talking about in chapter 3 is this: Concrete and abstract characterize human thinking in the different phases of its development. By the time we reach chapter 7, and start thinking in terms of &amp;lsquo;secularization’, I will be talking about secularizing religious themes with respect to the same.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt; Neither the words ‘concrete’ or ‘abstract’, nor the concepts associated with them are &amp;lsquo;religious’. (In this sense, concepts are neither &amp;lsquo;religious’ nor &amp;lsquo;scientific’.) The same applies to the use of words ‘concrete thought’ and &amp;lsquo;abstract thought’ (or to their meaning). But what is religious is the above idea, which speaks of different stages of human cognitive growth in terms of &amp;lsquo;concrete’ and ‘abstract thought’.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Intelligibility of Advaita</title>
      <link>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/intelligibility-of-advaita/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 21 May 2012 07:30:31 +0530</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/intelligibility-of-advaita/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The problem with the advaita tradition today is its lack of intelligibility. &amp;lsquo;Maya&amp;rsquo;, for instance, does a tremendous lot of explanatory work, but it is hardly clear what it is; multiple concepts like &amp;lsquo;manas&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;buddhi&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;chitta&amp;rsquo; occur and we do not know how these concepts relate to each other, whether they refer, whether they are a part of psychological theorizing or merely an exercise in philosophical anthropology. It is further unclear whether they are &amp;lsquo;psychological faculties&amp;rsquo; or theoretical terms. The nature of &amp;lsquo;atman&amp;rsquo; is unclear: is it a physical body or non-physical body? What its relationship to the organic body? Is it a form of monism (&amp;rsquo;everything is atman&amp;rsquo;) or dualism (&amp;lsquo;atman is the sovereign&amp;rsquo;) or something entirely different altogether? How do these terms relate to the different forms of psychological theories we have: from commonsense psychology to cognitive science? Further, it is unclear too what gets reborn if &amp;lsquo;punarjanma&amp;rsquo; means rebirth. If atman is not the organic body, is it an emergent property of the brain, or of consciousness? If not, how can it ever become &amp;lsquo;self-conscious&amp;rsquo;? And, of course, there is the preoccupation whether Advaita is compatible with the results of scientific research. These are merely some of the reasons why Advaita lacks intelligibility today.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What is rubbish about the ‘self’ and what not?</title>
      <link>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/what-is-rubbish-about-the-self-and-what-not/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 27 Aug 2011 08:49:00 +0530</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/what-is-rubbish-about-the-self-and-what-not/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few points about &amp;lsquo;self&amp;rsquo; and about what I have said and have not.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt; Comment: &amp;ldquo;Say, Mr. X made 1 run, 2 runs, 3, 4, n, and a total of 50 runs. Now to say &amp;ldquo;I made 50 runs&amp;rdquo; is to assume that, Mr. X who made 1 run, 2 run, etc. is linked to each other, and this organism , in this sense, has a unity. This unity is what Balu calls rubbish&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, I do not call this &amp;lsquo;unity&amp;rsquo; rubbish. Second, this is a problem not pertaining to &amp;rsquo;the self&amp;rsquo; but one applicable to any object or entity that persists over time. Because we can speak about the spatial and temporal career of an object (whether it involves disassembling and then reassembling a watch or whether it is about a merger of two corporations or firms or about our bodies or whatever), the logical problem of identity crops up: what makes some object, any object, the same object at different spatial and temporal intervals? I.e. how can the organism (currently called &amp;lsquo;Balu&amp;rsquo;, say) be the same organism when, as it spatially and temporally moves in the world, it accrues different properties? After all, &amp;lsquo;Balu&amp;rsquo; at some spatio-temporal point (say when the organism is 5 years old) has properties different from &amp;lsquo;Balu&amp;rsquo; at some other spatio-temporal interval. Because these two spatio-temporal units do not have identical properties, they have to be different objects. Yet, we say &amp;lsquo;here is Balu&amp;rsquo;s photo when he was 5 years old&amp;rsquo;. The problem of logical identity crops up in such contexts. As I say, this is a problem that confronts any theory of identity (as a logical relationship). Philosophy of logic has provided a few solutions to this question even if they all face problems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Hindering the emergence of alternative explanations: Colonialism</title>
      <link>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/hindering-the-emergence-of-alternative-explanations-colonialism/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/hindering-the-emergence-of-alternative-explanations-colonialism/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Earlier, I suggested that the psychoanalytical explanations (like the transformation of Linga into a penis as a fertility symbol etc.) not only trivialize and distort but also deny access to our own experience. In this post, I want to highlight &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; of the consequences of transforming our experiences in this fashion. In at least two different ways, &lt;em&gt;these explanations hinder the emergence of alternative or different explanations of our experiences&lt;/em&gt;. This is relevant to both of us. That is why, when confronted with such explanations, we do not know &lt;em&gt;what to say&lt;/em&gt;. These explanations rob us not only of our experience; while doing so, they shut us up as well. As far as you are concerned, while rendering you deaf to the silence from our end, it further &lt;em&gt;blinds&lt;/em&gt; you. If this is the case, one might as well ask oneself what you describe. Are you describing what you &amp;lsquo;see&amp;rsquo; in the mystical Ramakrishna? You could not: after all, what can you see, when you are blind? Nor it could be that you describe what you hear: you have become deaf to us. What, then, are you describing when you describe &lt;em&gt;your experience&lt;/em&gt;? This issue is what this post will be about.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Translations or Travesty of Traditions? –S.N.Balagangadhara</title>
      <link>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/translations-or-travesty-of-traditions-s-n-balagangadhara/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In one sense, the title of the piece captures the nature of the tasks facing the contemporary generation, whether in India or in the Diaspora. This generation, unlike many from mine, is confident and self-assured; perhaps, it is proud too about the strength of its culture and traditions. Rightly so. However, personal convictions about the value of our traditions and culture do not automatically guarantee the truth of such convictions. Not only that. It is also the case that the history of India, and that of the entire humankind, requires of us that we are able to say and show what is valuable and what is not in our traditions. This history is the history of colonialism, subservience, and is further weighed down by the scientific, technological, economic and the military weight of the western culture. Today, we need more than a mere practice and a further continuation of our traditions; we need also to examine them honestly and critically in order that we may transmit what we found valuable in them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Achievements of Indology: Esoteric Indian traditions</title>
      <link>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/achievements-of-indology-esoteric-indian-traditions/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A science of cultures is not Atmagyaana or Brahmagyaana. Let me also add that I find a quest for happiness a normal human striving.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;According to the Indian traditions, experience itself is a state of being: anubhava. In my story, so is happiness (or atmasaakshaatkaara). Need one be enlightened in order to speak about enlightenment? Should that be the case, one cannot strive for enlightenment at all and I think that enlightenment (or happiness) is a legitimate goal for human beings. If happiness is not an esoteric state of being but a legitimate goal for all human beings, there are indefinitely many roads to that state of being. The strength of the Indian traditions lies not merely in recognizing this but also in working out many such routes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What is Anubhava? III</title>
      <link>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/what-is-anubhava-iv/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 17 Mar 2011 01:40:08 +0530</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/what-is-anubhava-iv/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let us retain the translation of &amp;lsquo;Anu&amp;rsquo; as &amp;lsquo;appropriate&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;apt&amp;rsquo;. Let us emphasize the active dimension of the word &amp;lsquo;Bhava&amp;rsquo; to translate it as &amp;lsquo;coming into existence&amp;rsquo;. (&amp;lsquo;Existence&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;being&amp;rsquo; are also acceptable translations of the word &amp;lsquo;Bhava&amp;rsquo;.) Then &amp;lsquo;Anubhava&amp;rsquo; would mean an apt way of coming-into-existence. The problem here is this: we can ask the question, &lt;em&gt;coming into existence of what?&lt;/em&gt; Of course, we can answer it easily by using hyphenation: it is not the coming-into-existence of any &amp;rsquo;thing&amp;rsquo; but coming-into &amp;rsquo;existence&amp;rsquo;. However, this might create more confusion than it solves. So, let us make a compromise here for the sake of clarity: coming-into-existence-of-being. We can also shorten it as coming-into-being, where we understand &amp;lsquo;being&amp;rsquo; as &amp;lsquo;origin&amp;rsquo;. We come into existence, we originate. In this sense, &amp;lsquo;Anubhava&amp;rsquo; talks about &amp;ldquo;an appropriate originating&amp;rdquo;. (This is all heavy-duty philosophy stuff, this is what &amp;lsquo;ontology&amp;rsquo; is, the &amp;lsquo;doctrine of being&amp;rsquo;.) As long as we keep these ideas in mind, we can say that &amp;lsquo;bhava&amp;rsquo; can be translated also as &amp;lsquo;being-there-in the world&amp;rsquo;, or as &amp;lsquo;being present in the world&amp;rsquo;. Thus, &amp;lsquo;anubhava&amp;rsquo;, or experience, is &amp;lsquo;being appropriately present in the world&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;being aptly present in the world&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What is experience? I</title>
      <link>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/what-is-experience-iii/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 17 Mar 2011 01:33:01 +0530</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/what-is-experience-iii/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The biggest issue is: what is experience? All the Indian traditions have been busy with answering this question. But both posing this question and answering it are themselves experiential, as far as the Indian traditions are concerned. For instance, according to the so-called Buddhist traditions, the structures-in-experience are not given in the experience itself: the impermanence and transience of experience has to do with the realization that the description of the experience provides a sense of permanence because all descriptions of experience &amp;lsquo;create&amp;rsquo; structures. Here, it has to do with structures like &amp;lsquo;self&amp;rsquo;, specific emotions, and such like. But that does not mean that the Buddhist tradition says that our &amp;rsquo;experience&amp;rsquo; of a tree, or a stone or a car, etc. is illusory. That is, they do not say that the &amp;rsquo;experience&amp;rsquo; of the external world is an illusion.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If we take our English language use as a reference point, it appears as though we can speak sensibly about experiencing our feelings (&amp;lsquo;I experience sadness&amp;rsquo;), experiencing thoughts (&amp;lsquo;I can even now experience my jumbled thoughts when &amp;hellip;&amp;rsquo;), experiencing colour (&amp;lsquo;I experience a redness&amp;rsquo;), experiencing actions (&amp;lsquo;I still experience my shaking limbs when I&amp;hellip;&amp;rsquo;) and so on. That is, we can experience the &amp;lsquo;inputs&amp;rsquo; of all our five senses. From this, it follows that experience &lt;em&gt;cannot be&lt;/em&gt; identical to any of them. Experience might contain, as its elements, inputs from these five senses in the form of thoughts, feelings, sensations, etc. but it cannot be coextensive with any one of them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What is experience? II</title>
      <link>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/what-is-experience-i/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 17 Mar 2011 01:28:55 +0530</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/what-is-experience-i/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;1.1. Let us begin with the word &amp;ldquo;Anubhava&amp;rdquo;, which we use to translate the English word &amp;ldquo;experience&amp;rdquo;. There are two sub-words here: Anu and Bhava. &amp;lsquo;Anu&amp;rsquo; can be translated as &amp;lsquo;apt&amp;rsquo;, or &amp;lsquo;appropriate&amp;rsquo;, whereas &amp;lsquo;Bhava&amp;rsquo; can be rendered as &amp;rsquo;existence&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;being&amp;rsquo;. (The word also has an active dimension of &amp;lsquo;becoming&amp;rsquo; as one of its meanings.) So, &amp;lsquo;anubhava&amp;rsquo; would mean having an appropriate existence or even an appropriate way of being-in-the-world. Appropriate to what though? Appropriate to the things, events, and the people one meets in the world. So, &amp;rsquo;experience&amp;rsquo; means a way of being present in the world that is appropriate to whatever one encounters in the world. It is, if you like, &amp;lsquo;being-present-with&amp;rsquo;. This means that we need time: to discover ways that are appropriate to the different things we relate to in the world, we have to take our time to get to know them. That is to say, if one wants to experience the world, one has to take the time, have patience and be there. In short, &amp;rsquo;experience&amp;rsquo; indicates a stance or an attitude we assume in the world with respect to whatever we encounter (think, taste, perceive, hear, feel, touch) in the world. Experience, thus, includes sensations, perceptions, feelings, thoughts etc but is not co-extensive with any of them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Introspection vs. reflection on experience—S.N.Balagangadhara</title>
      <link>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/introspection-vs-reflection-upon-experience-s-n-balagangadhara/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 05 Mar 2011 09:05:01 +0530</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/introspection-vs-reflection-upon-experience-s-n-balagangadhara/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this post, I want to reflect on what it means &lt;em&gt;to access and think&lt;/em&gt; about experience. Perhaps, not so much on what these words mean but what is entailed by (or what happens when we indulge in) this kind of activity. I think the best way to begin this analysis is by asking the following two questions about an activity familiar to most of us: what do we do when we think about ourselves? Do we do it the &amp;lsquo;right&amp;rsquo; way? Let me begin with the first question and postpone looking at the second for a later stage, including how we should understand it. Because most of us know how we think about ourselves most of the times, I will take a trivial example and skip over certain explanations and analyses. The holes in my reasoning can either be filled by our memories or by discussing them at a later stage.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
