      <title>How to read Gita?</title>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If you insist that without situating Gita in the massive text that Mahabharata is, we cannot understand or interpret Gita, then you provide such a gigantic &lt;em&gt;con&lt;/em&gt;-text to the 18 chapters that the Gita is, and because a move like this can only give interpretations of a small text by situating in such a huge &lt;em&gt;con&lt;/em&gt;-text, any and almost every interpretation can become valid or acceptable or permissible. We will have on our hands a plethora of interpretations, many in conflict with the other, so that we cannot even decide whether there is even one or some interpretation(s) that is (are) better than the other. We end up formulating an impossible problem: which interpretation to choose and why? We cannot appeal to the implicit goal present in text interpretations, viz., consistency and completeness nor to criterion like coherence (because it is unclear what coherence would consist of in this case).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Suppose that you ask the following question instead: which other texts (that is, &lt;em&gt;con&lt;/em&gt;-texts) do we need to read and understand the two articles on relativity? We do need background knowledge to draw some possible implications from these articles, but what &lt;em&gt;con&lt;/em&gt;-texts do we need? Which con-texts are needed to study Feynman’s Lectures, or Darwin’s origin or similar works in the natural sciences? Some knowledge is required; some skills are necessary; we must be able to read a natural language, etc., but these are not &lt;em&gt;con&lt;/em&gt;-texts but requirements to acquire knowledge.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Suppose further that you see the Gita as a text that imparts knowledge. (I will leave out the question what that knowledge could be.) Suppose too that there are prerequisites to acquire this knowledge, as is the case with knowledge. And that we can evaluate and judge the Gita as knowledge as well. Which insurmountable problem does such an approach create? One might not be able to read the Gita and acquire the knowledge it imparts by just knowing a natural language. However, that would apply to all knowledge, would it not? You will not understand the relativity theories just because you can read those articles in, say, the original or in a faithful translation. A popular commentary that ‘explains’ these papers will not make you a physicist either. What hinders us from looking at the Gita this way? What objections are there for such an approach?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In fact, if you look at most claims made about the Gita (Sen, Doniger, Danto, etc.), you notice that they look at the Gita either as a literary text, or as a quasi-moral or philosophical text, or as a religious text etc. I have not come across a single interpretation of even the first chapter of the Gita that goes beyond these approaches and almost all of them tell the same story: Arjuna was despondent or felt extremely sad that he must kill (his relatives) on the battlefield and the 17 chapters of the Gita are there to ‘comfort’ him. How do they do so? The acts and consequences story is one answer. Here are my naïve questions: why write 17 chapters just to say ‘karmanyevadhikaraste…’? After all, this thought is exactly one verse long and, in fact, it is written out in the Gita. What do the other verses do? How, exactly, do these 17 chapters ‘comfort’ Arjuna and ‘therapeutically’ cure his despondency? I have not read anyone either raising these questions or answering them. (I confess that I have not read many commentaries. I am glad about this.) How does the fourth chapter (on Jnanyoga) answer any of the questions that Arjuna raises in the first chapter; what are the answers to those questions; and how exactly do these answers remove Arjuna’s despondency?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Such and many other questions arise if and only if you do not see the Gita as a literary, moral, philosophical, or religious text. If you see it as a knowledge text, these and many more questions arise to which the Gita attempts to give an answer. If one takes such an approach, I see its con-&lt;em&gt;text&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;adding&lt;/em&gt; (in some of the Parvas) explications, clarifications and reasonings that are present in extremely abbreviated forms in the Gita.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;</description>

      <title>Spirituality = Adhyatma?</title>
      <link>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/spirituality-adhyatma/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One could justifiably see spirituality (the Jewish, Christian and Islamic) as ‘Adhyatma’ if one focusses on the psychological transformations that a human being undergoes in the process of moving from the mundane life to a ‘spiritual’ one. You would be closer to the notion of ‘Adhyatma’ if you can also additionally guide such a process. Such guidance requires, of course, that there is some deep understanding of such transformative processes and their mechanisms.&#xA;Yet, I would be hesitant to suggest that ‘spirituality’ translates ‘adhyatma’ or the other way round. From among the many reasons, I pick three:&#xA;(a) because the weight of the word ‘spirituality’ is drawn from Christianity, i.e., the kind of transformative force on a human being that we have in mind is the work of the ‘holy spirit’, it would be inappropriate to translate ‘adhyatma’ as ‘spirituality’;&#xA;(b) it is difficult to characterize the changes in human beings that we are talking about by using this word in Islam and Judaism as well. There is no ‘holy spirit’ in these two religions that does the work of the Trinitarian holy spirit;&#xA;(c) since a ‘spiritual’ person is the result of the workings of the holy spirit, in the context of Adhyatma which insists that transformations are the results of human phenomena working on human beings, the use of this word would be inappropriate. Both the Christian and the Adhyatmic use militates against such a translation.&#xA;In short, no, we should not translate ‘spirituality’ as ‘adhyatma’.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Descriptions about the world vs. Manuals for action</title>
      <link>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/descriptions-vs-manuals/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 28 Sep 2022 19:59:21 +0530</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/descriptions-vs-manuals/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is broadly accepted that one of the most important functions of language is to describe the world outside it. Could it be the case that when it comes to the Indian systems, they all (whether it is Advaita vedanta, Yoga vasistha, visista advaita) are teaching one to act, to live in a particular way? In other words, they are not saying what there is in the world but are manuals in a manner of speaking. Of course, in order to understand a manual you need reference points in the world. So when they say for example that when the Buddha argued for &lt;em&gt;anatman&lt;/em&gt; or Sankara spoke about &lt;em&gt;atman&lt;/em&gt;, one way of interpreting, which is what most Indian philosophers have done, is that they attribute doctrines to them and say this is a description of the world. But actually they were not describing the world. Buddha does not say atman exists or does not exist or whatever. Sankara is not saying &lt;em&gt;atman&lt;/em&gt; exists because that would be a description of our world. So what a guru does in our tradition, which is what the upadesa is, is to teach one to not look at these as descriptions of the world; he teaches one how to transform them into a way of living. So Yoga vasistha does not tell you what the world is like. That can be said in one sentence. Why then does this man have to write so much? It is to help you go on in a certain way and then say that this is not a description of the world.&#xA;(p. 308 &amp;ldquo;Classical Indian Thought and the English Language&amp;rdquo; edited by Mullick, et al.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Swami, the Priest, and the Rediscovery of the Indian Traditions</title>
      <link>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/the-swami-the-priest-and-the-rediscovery-of-the-indian-traditions/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I will take up some of the general points, which I think are relevant to the Indian American community at large. First, let me say I am impressed by the dynamism present in this community. In spite of the demands of daily life, Indian Americans find the time and energy to engage in intellectual debates about the nature of their traditions. In spite of the discrimination and &amp;ldquo;religion oppression&amp;rdquo; [1] faced by them, there is a general sense of optimism about the future of these traditions.&#xA;It is important that this dynamism remain a positive force. Some Indian Americans have adopted the name-calling that we find among certain American academics. Whereas the latter call anyone who dares say a few positive words about the Indian traditions &amp;ldquo;a Hindutva sycophant,&amp;rdquo; the former trend to label any western intellectual who dares question the dominant representations of the Indian traditions as a &amp;ldquo;Witzellian.&amp;rdquo; The legitimate discontent about the academic representation of the Indian traditions should not lead us to a general anti-intellectual stance. Anti-intellectualism knows only one endpoint: the &lt;em&gt;Taliban&lt;/em&gt;. Now, if there is one community aware of the duty to avoid that society moves towards that point, it is the Indian American community. Since intellectuals share this sense of duty, our study of the Indian traditions should show how they can contribute to making American society a more tolerant, open-minded and happier society.&#xA;As Chitra Raman affirms, the Indian traditions have been conceptualized in an extremely impoverished manner during the last few centuries. It is the hypothesis of our research group that this is the case because they have been viewed &lt;em&gt;through a secularized biblical framework&lt;/em&gt;. [2] The same framework also puts conceptual limitations on the structure of American pluralism. This is not an assessment about the origins of this form of pluralism or a judgment about its biased nature, but rather a &lt;em&gt;cognitive&lt;/em&gt; analysis of its contemporary structure. Such an analysis cannot be challenged by a moralizing judgement (e.g., that it justifies discrimination). The only way to really challenge my hypothesis is to develop another hypothesis about the structure of American pluralism. Naturally, its purpose is to develop new ways of solving the problems of pluralism in the U.S. To do so, one should indeed strive to bring American pluralism beyond its biblical straitjacket in the near future. Perhaps, no group is as qualified to do so as the Indian Americans.&#xA;But before they can take up this task, they should understand the depth of the predicament. Even more so, they have to become aware that they have appropriated the secularized Christian conception of the Indian traditions as a self-description. The predicament we face is &lt;em&gt;cognitive&lt;/em&gt; in nature: the currently dominant conception of the Indian traditions makes sense only against the background of the biblical framework. It is cognitive in the sense that the way we currently think and talk about “Hinduism” leads to a distortion of the very nature of the Indian traditions. This dominant conception of “Hinduism” does not describe these traditions themselves, but rather &lt;em&gt;how they appear through western and Christian lenses&lt;/em&gt;. Yet many Indians and Indian Americans talk as though this conception makes eminent sense to them.&#xA;Chitra Raman develops a nice analogy: it is like using the grammar of one language to understand another. One may adopt the words of the second language, but when one embeds them in the grammatical structure of the first language, one ends up with virtual gibberish. The analogy can be taken further: today, it is as though the native speakers of the second language have accepted the grammatical structure of the first language as the only correct one and they try to speak their own language in this way. This is the nature of our predicament: many Indians and Indian Americans have adopted the conceptual framework of Christianity to talk about their own traditions. They assume the Indian traditions are a belief system or religion with its own doctrines, commandments and rules. As I will try to show, this makes about as much sense as using the grammatical structure of one language to speak another completely different language.&#xA;To avoid any misunderstanding, let it be clear that the denial that the Indian traditions are of the same nature as biblical religion does not involve any value judgement. They also have a highly-developed structure, but this is so different from Judaism, Christianity and Islam that it is impossible to maintain that the Indian traditions and the latter three are instances of the same kind. In fact, once we appreciate how different the Indian traditions are from these religions, we will rediscover how rich and valuable they really are. To return to the language analogy: if we used the grammatical structure of one language to speak another, we would not be able to understand this second language and would also ignore its rich contributions to literature, philosophy and poetry. It is only when we rediscover the structure of this second language that its treasures become available to us. Similarly, when we rediscover the nature of the Indian traditions and rescue them from being transformed into just another religion, we will be able to show how they have contributed to the pursuit of knowledge at a level undreamt of.&#xA;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Priest and the Swami&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&#xA;In &lt;em&gt;Facing the Challenge of American Pluralism&lt;/em&gt;, I argued that the Indian traditions revolve around the exploring and examining of one’s experience so as to attain perfect happiness. What does this mean? How is it different from what religions like Christianity and Islam do? As an entry point, take a Hindu swamiji and a Christian priest. The priest says “God is a Trinity.” The swamiji says “&lt;em&gt;Tat Tvam Asi&lt;/em&gt;.” What is the difference between the two?&#xA;First the priest. The sentence “God is a Trinity” is a doctrine to him; it is a proposition about the world, which he takes to be absolutely true. Because it is a doctrine, the sentence is embedded in an elaborate theological system. It is related to other sentences that explain its true meaning: theological doctrines about Jesus being the Son of God and the Father, the Son and the Spirit being one substance, but three persons. Arguments have been developed to establish the truth of the Trinitarian doctrine. Its correct formulation was discussed and fixed at the First Council of Nicea in 325 AD. The result is the Nicene Creed: a set of beliefs that are held to reflect religious truth by most Christian denominations. As a Christian believer, when the priest says “God is a Trinity,” one is expected to accept this as a true belief, a doctrine embedded in a belief system that claims the one and only religious truth. As an orthodox Christian today, one should understand this doctrine, proclaim its truth and be able to defend it against its detractors. One should not question its truth and meaning. These have been fixed for good.&#xA;Now the swamiji. When he states “&lt;em&gt;Tat Tvam Asi&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt;”&lt;/em&gt; does he expect all Hindus to accept this sentence as a true doctrine? Does he want them to take this as a true belief, whose truth they should proclaim and defend against the “false beliefs” of other religions? Does he expect them to memorize the sentence and its related doctrines and arguments, and repeat them until eternity? No, he does not. When the swamiji teaches, he takes into account the different levels and experiences of his audience. He will explain “&lt;em&gt;Tat Tvam Asi&lt;/em&gt;” in different ways according to the different experiential levels of individuals. The sentence does not have one fixed true meaning, precisely because it functions as an instruction for exploring one’s own experience. It suggests that the distinction between I and not-I is a temporary figment that results from interpreting our experience in a particular way. If we examine this experience at a deeper level, we will slowly discover that there is no such distinction there. The swamiji’s explanation of the sentence will make sense to us, according to where we are on the path towards this discovery.&#xA;Hence, neither the speech of the &lt;em&gt;swamiji&lt;/em&gt; nor the texts of the Indian traditions can be understood as belief systems or doctrines, which have a fixed meaning and claim to reflect the one religious truth. They are “heuristics” that function as instructions for action to explore our own experience. To attain the insights embodied in these sentences, one has to examine them from all sides, relate them to one’s experience and question their truth repeatedly. Only in this way can they help us become better and happier human beings. The claim of the Indian traditions is not that we should accept them as true doctrines or that such acceptance is a precondition for attaining salvation. They do not postpone perfect happiness until after death. Neither do they claim that there is only one true path to attain this state. Rather, they claim that all human beings can attain perfect happiness here on earth and that there are countless ways to achieve this goal.&#xA;Those who conceptualize the Indian traditions as “belief systems,” “doctrines” or “religion” take away the unique nature of these traditions. They make the rich storehouse of experiential knowledge embodied by these traditions inaccessible and do so by transforming them into a belief system, the Hindu equivalent of Christianity or Islam. Let it be clear that the Indian traditions are neither belief systems nor religions. They are far more fascinating than that. I refer you to the piece by my teacher S. N. Balagangadhara (soon to be published on the India Forum website) to get a glimpse of how rich these traditions are. Here, just note that it is &lt;em&gt;precisely the way in which the Indian traditions are different from belief systems, which makes them into extremely important but uncharted contributions to the human pursuit of knowledge&lt;/em&gt;.&#xA;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transforming the Swami into a Priest&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&#xA;But what happens when we reduce the Indian traditions into a Hindu “religion,” “world view” or “belief system”? What are the consequences of transforming the swamiji into a priest? Why is this development so harmful?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Atman, Witness, and Experience</title>
      <link>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/atman-and-experience/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 02 May 2020 10:56:38 +0530</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/atman-and-experience/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some Swamiji claims: “One cannot experience the Atman[, the Atman] is the witness, it is what experiences.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Obviously, this is a very rough and approximate formulation. This statement is both wrong and right in different ways. (a) In the very early days, when I began to develop my meditation exercise, I ‘sensed’ the vague presence of an observer (somewhere present in the background of my experiential world). Or, you could say, I vaguely sensed that I was being ‘seen’ or that my meditative performance was being performed for an ‘outside’ observer. Perhaps, it would also be accurate to say that I sensed its vague presence outside my meditative world, but touching upon its edges. Later, when I was trying to help other people meditate, I discovered that some sensed this presence too and yet others had to ‘let go’ in order to sense this presence. I am guessing that this is the idea of Atman as a ‘witness’. Some were fearful and afraid of this presence as well. If you say that to sense the vague presence is to experience that presence, the Swamiji is wrong. If you see this vague sensing of a presence (or sensing the vague presence of something) as not experiencing, the Swamij would be right. (b) Does the Atman experience? If you keep the word ‘experience’ sufficiently broad (or nebulous), yes, that is true. Self-awareness is obviously ‘aware’ (working purely at a linguistic level); self-consciousness is obviously ‘conscious’ (I say this in my note as well to understand the access). In this sense, yes, the Swamiji is right. However, the Swamiji is wrong if we claim, which we have to, that experience (as we know it today) requires some kind of bodily constraint (i.e. the presence of an apparatus to experience). We have to say here that self-consciousness is not tantamount to ‘experience’. Then the question opens up: if self-consciousness is not ‘experience’ what else is it? I have no answer except to say that it is ‘self-consciousness’, period. It is also further true, on both accounts, that &lt;strong&gt;sentience does not experience self-consciousness but merely accesses it.&lt;/strong&gt; In that case, the next problem: what does this access generate? Some or another kind of experience or not? If we cannot provide some kind of a satisfactory answer, the word ‘access’ is an occult word and does no work. (These are not the only set of problems, but it does indicate why understanding ‘enlightenment’ is far, far more difficult than achieving that state.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>&#39;Grotesque&#39; nature of Murtis</title>
      <link>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/grotesque-nature-of-murtis/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/grotesque-nature-of-murtis/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Consider the fact that the Indian ‘gods’ are portrayed in at least two ways. First, there is their portrayal with four arms (say) and there is their portrayal in completely human forms. Krishna has four arms (with Shankha, Chakra, Gada and Padma or one hand with a blessing palm or downward indicating a mudra of some kind) and he also has a fully human form. The balakrishna’s I have seen give him only two arms. So do many images of Krishna: he has only two arms. However, apart from other symbols (flute, peacock feather, etc), his colour is almost invariant. Ganesha is even more interesting: there are balaganesha’s crawling with two arms and with four arms. There are images of a four-armed Ganesha sitting on the lap of a two-armed Shiva (with and without his third eye but holding a trishula). In any case, he has the elephant head. Most Durga’s have multiple arms, a few frightening heads but there are also those with human form and pretty faces. Same applies to Parvati, Laxmi and Saraswati. Except, of course, they invariably have pretty faces. They too have characteristic traits: seated on Padma, carrying a Veena, or next to Shiva or Ganesha or sitting on top of a mountain surrounded by snowy peaks. There are also others where she is on a peetha or is very well dressed and adorned with ornaments. In short, some or another trait is mostly present that identifies which ‘goddess’ or ‘god’ s/he is. The rest, obviously, is left free. Of course, there are also images that can only be identified, if so identified by local stories, the pujari’s at the temples and so on. If these are our ‘popular gods’, the less-known (say the village ‘goddesses’) are even more problematic. Many village ‘goddesses’ look similarly vague and are almost but not quite amorphous.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The word &amp;lsquo;yoni&amp;rsquo; here does much more work than one assumes. All the four are born from &amp;lsquo;Yoni&amp;rsquo; but yet are distinguished in terms of punya and paapa. The last two are earnt by the organism in question: &amp;lsquo;svayaarjita&amp;rsquo;, suggesting that being a brahmana and a rajarshi are earnt titles. As against it, we have a gender and a shudra. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Proselytizing drive of the Eastern Christianity in India</title>
      <link>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/proselytizing-drive-of-the-eastern-christianity-in-india/</link>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Actually, there are two questions that need to be distinguished from each other. There is, firstly, the question about the nature of &amp;lsquo;Eastern&amp;rsquo; Christianity. If it is muted in its proselytizing drive in all cultures the &lt;em&gt;same way&lt;/em&gt; and if it is &amp;rsquo;tolerant&amp;rsquo; in &lt;em&gt;exactly the same way&lt;/em&gt; in all cultures, it makes sense to ask the question whether (a) different factors in all these cultures have brought about the same effect (different &amp;lsquo;causes&amp;rsquo; can generate one and the same effect in differing circumstances) or (b) it is due to the nature of the &amp;lsquo;Eastern&amp;rsquo; Christianity itself. Nobody is able to make such a claim today. We do not possess the theoretical apparatus which would allow us to make sense of the remarks I have made in italics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Humility is a despicable vice</title>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Christianity (to some extent Judaism), presented an idea, unknown to the world in which it grew, namely the Pagan world of Rome. The idea was that human beings are creatures of God and that they belonged to His domain. He was the dominus or the Lord of the domain. As a result, human beings should not be arrogant, but must be humble instead. (As the ‘Book of Job’ in the Old Testament makes it clear, there is a very heavy price to be paid for arrogance.) Here, it belonged to the opposite spectrum in Ancient thought, which saw arrogance as a moral virtue and humility as a despicable vice. Protestant Christianity, especially Luther and Calvin, very forcefully propagated this idea: Man was a sinner, worse than the lowest worm, because of which God’s Grace becomes unfathomable and ungraspable.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Alleged conflict between &#39;Buddhism&#39; and &#39;Brahmanism&#39;</title>
      <link>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/alleged-conflict-between-buddhism-and-brahmanism/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If the ‘I’ cannot be individuated or described, then there is no possible distinction between the ‘I’ and ‘the Brahman’. They are different names for ‘self-awareness’ which pick out the differential access that individuals have to ‘self-awareness’. Hence, the curious distinction that some Indian traditions make. On the one hand, the ‘I’ is alleged to be identical with the ‘Brahman’; on the other, the same traditions distinguish between ‘Atmagyaana’ and ‘Brahmagyaana’. These two ‘gyanaas’ can be two types of knowledge, if, on one reading, they are knowledge about two different objects, namely ‘atman’ and ‘Brahman’. If, however, they are identical, there could be only one knowledge. Second, even that is not possible. We can only have knowledge of something, if that something exists. If Atman or Brahman exist in this Universe, they are also subject to the processes that occur here. One such is decay and disintegration. Therefore, if we think this problem through, there is only one conclusion possible (if we assume that all Indians have not always been imbeciles): the gyaana is about the processes of accessing the real. It is not and cannot be about the real.&#xA;This means that the debate within the Indian traditions is not and could not have been about the nature of ‘atman’ or ‘Brahman’. Thus, the idea that is propagated as ‘the’ truth about the alleged conflict between the dvaita and the advaita is spurious and false. There was clearly debates and conflicts. But these cannot be about the nature of the real.&#xA;The same is true about the alleged conflict between ‘Buddhism’ and ‘Brahmanism’. Atman and Anatman are not conflicting doctrines about the real at all; they could not be. It is logically impossible that this was the debate between representatives of these traditions, unless we assume that Indians are congenitally incapable of thinking logically,. Those who sell this story, whether in India or abroad, the western savants and their Indian slaves, are the truly perfect imbeciles, which they actually think that Indians are. These idiots are our professors and many guru’s in India and elsewhere.&#xA;Thus, we see that Ambedkar and the Ambedkarites (in India and elsewhere today) are total slaves of their western masters. To ‘convert’ from ‘Hinduism’ to ‘Buddhism’, as though they are conflicting religions, is to simply ape the western cretins who have been selling this story for nearly 200 years. Of course, the Ambedkarites do that because their fame and fortune depends on slavery. They would rather be slaves of cretins than live free as thinking human beings. The western ‘thinkers’ in the US fete them because they love the adulation and adoration they get from these Indians. And, as is the case with Pollock, they are “friends with benefits” with Indians:  getting millions of dollars from idiots like Narayan Murthy and receiving national awards from the Indian government.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Assumptions, Warrants, Hypotheses and Heuristics</title>
      <link>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/assumptions-warrants-hypotheses-heuristics/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/assumptions-warrants-hypotheses-heuristics/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;You say: &amp;ldquo;there seems to be an underlying assumption that all participants in the thread seem to be making. The assumption being that all these texts have the same end goal in mind, and that this end goal is enlightenment/eudaimonia/happiness. I submit that such an assumption is unwarranted.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It is not an assumption but an explicit hypothesis, as far as I am concerned, that all the Indian traditions (not just these two sets of texts, namely, Upanishads and Puranas) are concerned with the same end goal. I want to provide a description of the Indian traditions as attempts to help human beings find happiness on earth. (For the time being, in order to avoid fruitless controversies and to have a point of departure, I take Aristotelian Eudaimonia to be an explication of this notion of happiness.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Assumptions often do require warrant, but hypotheses do not. Because the truth of a conclusion depends on the truth of the premise (often, assumptions function as premises in an argument) provided valid rules of inferences are used, it makes sense to ask for the warrant of an assumption. Needless to say, this condition does not hold for hypotheses: you have to evaluate them entirely differently.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Of course, in one sense, such a reconstruction would be the hypothesis I propose. Until such stage, the belief about the commonality of the goal of the Indian traditions would be an assumption. However, it is not a premise in a logical deduction but one which functions as a heuristic. Consequently, if I need to convince you to accept this assumption for the time being, I need to show you what is cognitively interesting about this assumption.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It promises to help explain the rivalry within the Indian traditions; it sheds new light on the inter-relationship between them in a different way than as &amp;lsquo;syncretism&amp;rsquo;; it helps one look for a set of problems underlying the Indian traditions; it allows one to formulate these problems in the twenty-first century language; it helps one evaluate the answers of these traditions and even carry them forward. These are some of the cognitive benefits of this assumption.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Of course, ultimately, it might turn out to be the case that no such goal is to be found and that the Indian traditions are not each other&amp;rsquo;s rivals. I do not know. For the time being, this idea appears very productive. That is enough of a warrant.&#xA;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you want to use &lt;strong&gt;Nirvana Shatkam&lt;/strong&gt;*,* it might be more productive to choose translations which do the job that the text can. Because of that, a ‘faithful’ translation of Sanskrit into English is not the primary requirement; the process and the goal should determine how the words are best understood. With this in mind, some suggestions regarding the translation of the Sanskrit verses.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is important to notice that the words in these verses refer to components (physical, physiological, psychological, etc.). Therefore, assume that human ‘mind’ (or human psychology) is referred to (or spoken of) in modular terms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I would like to address a very basic issue that many of us have confronted. In its simplest form, the question is this: What should we, a small slice of the Indian intelligentsia, be doing? We can vent our anger and frustration at the way the Indian politicians are handling (or mishandling) the Kashmiri situation; we can express hurt and outrage that &amp;lsquo;Hindus&amp;rsquo; are singled out for special treatment both by the &amp;rsquo;liberals&amp;rsquo; and by a section of the Muslim population; we can propose a trifurcation of Kashmir; or that the Muslims be &amp;rsquo;taught&amp;rsquo; a lesson (whatever that lesson consists of); indulge in abuse and name-calling; or whatever else that takes our fancy at any particular moment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How to speak for the Indian traditions: an agenda for the future--SN Balagangadhara</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editor&amp;rsquo;s note: This article appeared in the Journal of American Academy of Religion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The paper attempts a contrast between the process and the structure of the Christian and the Indian spirituality. Drawing attention to their dissimilarities, it attempts to reformulate the differences among the Indian traditions in a novel way. It argues that cultures and traditions are not just different; but that they differ from each other in different ways as well. The future of religious studies, it is suggested, is dependent on developing the ability to develop new ways of describing the differences between cultures and traditions. This is the agenda for the future. As a correlate to this task, the paper suggests that we replace the question &amp;ldquo;who speaks &amp;lsquo;for&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;about&amp;rsquo; a religion?&amp;rdquo; with a more pregnant and a more accurate reformulation: &amp;ldquo;how to speak for a religion in the Academy?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Sanskrit word (that I know) that comes closest to the Greek &amp;rsquo;telos&amp;rsquo; is &amp;lsquo;Sankalpa&amp;rsquo;. It means &amp;rsquo;to mentally determine&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;formulation of an end&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;desirous of (an end)&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;anticipation (of an end)&amp;rsquo; etc. It also means &amp;lsquo;Buddhi&amp;rsquo; in some contexts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the primary properties of religion is that it &lt;em&gt;generates&lt;/em&gt; questions about &amp;ldquo;the meaning and purpose of life&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;meaning and purpose of existence&amp;rdquo; and such like, both at an individual level and at the level of a culture.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Intelligibility of Advaita</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/intelligibility-of-advaita/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The problem with the advaita tradition today is its lack of intelligibility. &amp;lsquo;Maya&amp;rsquo;, for instance, does a tremendous lot of explanatory work, but it is hardly clear what it is; multiple concepts like &amp;lsquo;manas&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;buddhi&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;chitta&amp;rsquo; occur and we do not know how these concepts relate to each other, whether they refer, whether they are a part of psychological theorizing or merely an exercise in philosophical anthropology. It is further unclear whether they are &amp;lsquo;psychological faculties&amp;rsquo; or theoretical terms. The nature of &amp;lsquo;atman&amp;rsquo; is unclear: is it a physical body or non-physical body? What its relationship to the organic body? Is it a form of monism (&amp;rsquo;everything is atman&amp;rsquo;) or dualism (&amp;lsquo;atman is the sovereign&amp;rsquo;) or something entirely different altogether? How do these terms relate to the different forms of psychological theories we have: from commonsense psychology to cognitive science? Further, it is unclear too what gets reborn if &amp;lsquo;punarjanma&amp;rsquo; means rebirth. If atman is not the organic body, is it an emergent property of the brain, or of consciousness? If not, how can it ever become &amp;lsquo;self-conscious&amp;rsquo;? And, of course, there is the preoccupation whether Advaita is compatible with the results of scientific research. These are merely some of the reasons why Advaita lacks intelligibility today.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How to access Indian traditions?</title>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I have often said, the most intriguing aspect of the Indian culture is the kind of knowledge it produced and encouraged people to produce: experiential knowledge which emerges by systematically reflecting on our (human) experiences in the world. As human beings, our experiences are many: no one set, no one kind of experience exhausts what we go through. From the purely personal experiences of the world (our ambitions, hopes, dreams, frustrations, etc) to the entirely social ones (the experiences of sorrow and injustice that other human beings in the world experience). So, knowledge that reflects on or thinks about and systematizes such experiences presupposes multiple learning sites, many diverse perspectives and varied kinds of intellectual skills.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Before deciding about whether or not Vivekananda was ethnocentric, jingoistic or even plain intolerant, one has to understand what Vivekananda was saying. In doing so, the interpretative &amp;ldquo;principle of charity&amp;rdquo; requires us to render him maximally consistent.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Consider the title of this thread: &amp;ldquo;All religions are true&amp;rdquo;. Spelling-out Vivekananda&amp;rsquo;s stance regarding this theme presupposes the ability to provide convincing answers to questions about what Vivekananda thought &amp;ldquo;religion&amp;rdquo; was, what &amp;ldquo;truth&amp;rdquo; was, and how the latter relates to the former.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Secularized Christian theme: Hacker’s inclusivism and exclusivm</title>
      <link>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/secularized-christian-theme-hackers-inclusivism-and-exclusivm/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 12 Dec 2011 02:43:15 +0530</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/secularized-christian-theme-hackers-inclusivism-and-exclusivm/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When we consider  Paul Hacker&amp;rsquo;s story on &amp;lsquo;inclusivism as a typically Indian thought form&amp;rsquo;, all we can conclude is that he has used a &lt;em&gt;typically Christian  thought form&lt;/em&gt; to understand an aspect of the Indian cultural traditions, which he is unable to understand because it is completely different from what he knows. Hacker&amp;rsquo;s inclusivism is merely an attempt to strip the following Christian account from its recognizably Christian characteristics: &amp;ldquo;When God created man he inscribed him with a sense of divinity, and when it is &lt;em&gt;not corrupted&lt;/em&gt; this sense is the true religion. Throughout human history the devil and his minions corrupted this sense of divinity into false religion or worship of the devil among all human peoples. Until the good Lord brought mankind back to the true religion by revealing himself in Jesus Christ. Thus, Christianity is the one true religion. It is the message of self-disclosure in which God reveals his Will for the universe to the humankind. Of course, all other traditions contain traces of divine revelation, but these are nothing but the preparation of the Gospel. Once the true religion was revealed again, all non-Christian traditions could be nothing but pale and erring variants of Christianity.&amp;rdquo; Now Hacker has merely taken this Christian conceptual scheme to make sense of the attitude the Indian traditions take towards other traditions. Although it happens unconsciously most of the time, this is &lt;em&gt;the basic method of Indology&lt;/em&gt;: one looks at the Indian traditions, and the only way to make sense of them is to make them fit into a conceptual framework of secularized Christian theology.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If we want to grasp the nature of the discussions in the Indian traditions, there is much we need to do beforehand: (a) identify the entity they were talking about; (b) identify the specific questions they were answering; (c) identify the generic questions that defined both the outlines of the acceptable answers and the formulation of the specific questions; etc. (The &amp;lsquo;cetera&amp;rsquo; indicates that I do not know how to enumerate all the things we need to grasp.) In the case of the propositions you have formulated, I assume that &amp;lsquo;God&amp;rsquo; is Vishnu (or even Krishna) and not, say, Shiva or Brahma because you are talking about the Madhvas. However, to keep the discussion faithful to your formulations, I will use the word &amp;lsquo;God&amp;rsquo; to refer to Vishnu.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Is Maya an Illusion? Nonsense sold by Scholars!</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;According to your account, Vedanta claims that the &lt;em&gt;world is an illusion&lt;/em&gt; and that only the Brahman is real.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the world is an illusion, Vedanta has to deny the reality of the world. To it, in the way you construe Vedanta, the world &lt;em&gt;is the empty set&lt;/em&gt;. That is to say, all experiences are on par because they are all illusions. One cannot distinguish between experiences unless one introduces the notion of a differentiated reality. From this, it follows that a vedantin should not be able to discriminate, say, between the following: the pain you have by stubbing your toe, the pain you have when your arm is cut off without anaesthesia, and the pain you feel when your loved one dies. If he does draw a distinction between them, he is distinguishing one illusion from the other and the only way of doing that is to ascribe to these illusions the status of reality: this is &amp;rsquo;less illusory&amp;rsquo; than… this is &amp;lsquo;more real&amp;rsquo; than… this &amp;lsquo;pains more than&amp;rsquo;… this pain is &amp;lsquo;different from&amp;rsquo;…and so on. If he does not distinguish, and insists there is no difference between falling in a lake and bumping his head against a tree, who would take him seriously? Do you believe that Indians are such cretins that they would simply accept such inane stories? Surely, if &amp;lsquo;Brahman&amp;rsquo; is all there is to Vedanta, all vedantins must be perfect imbeciles. In that case, we do not need heavy-duty tantric stuff to shoot them down; a simple dose of commonsense will do.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What is rubbish about the ‘self’ and what not?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few points about &amp;lsquo;self&amp;rsquo; and about what I have said and have not.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt; Comment: &amp;ldquo;Say, Mr. X made 1 run, 2 runs, 3, 4, n, and a total of 50 runs. Now to say &amp;ldquo;I made 50 runs&amp;rdquo; is to assume that, Mr. X who made 1 run, 2 run, etc. is linked to each other, and this organism , in this sense, has a unity. This unity is what Balu calls rubbish&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, I do not call this &amp;lsquo;unity&amp;rsquo; rubbish. Second, this is a problem not pertaining to &amp;rsquo;the self&amp;rsquo; but one applicable to any object or entity that persists over time. Because we can speak about the spatial and temporal career of an object (whether it involves disassembling and then reassembling a watch or whether it is about a merger of two corporations or firms or about our bodies or whatever), the logical problem of identity crops up: what makes some object, any object, the same object at different spatial and temporal intervals? I.e. how can the organism (currently called &amp;lsquo;Balu&amp;rsquo;, say) be the same organism when, as it spatially and temporally moves in the world, it accrues different properties? After all, &amp;lsquo;Balu&amp;rsquo; at some spatio-temporal point (say when the organism is 5 years old) has properties different from &amp;lsquo;Balu&amp;rsquo; at some other spatio-temporal interval. Because these two spatio-temporal units do not have identical properties, they have to be different objects. Yet, we say &amp;lsquo;here is Balu&amp;rsquo;s photo when he was 5 years old&amp;rsquo;. The problem of logical identity crops up in such contexts. As I say, this is a problem that confronts any theory of identity (as a logical relationship). Philosophy of logic has provided a few solutions to this question even if they all face problems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Is bhakti what the bhaktas do, or are people bhaktas because they &amp;lsquo;follow&amp;rsquo; (bad choice of words, but there is no other way to put it) the &amp;lsquo;bhakti marga&amp;rsquo;, or is bhakti &lt;em&gt;neither&lt;/em&gt; of the two? I mean: is the bhakta moved because, for example, the child who stole the butter happens to be the &lt;em&gt;Kannan&lt;/em&gt;, or because the &lt;em&gt;child&lt;/em&gt;, who also happens to be the Lord, stole the butter? If it is the first, it is &lt;em&gt;worthless&lt;/em&gt;: it is the same as being a sycophant (as the Americans would put it: one sucks up to &amp;hellip;). If the second, it is false: surely, we are not moved to tears when our children steal and the lie about it. When the mother gets to hear from a child: &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;I&amp;rsquo; did not steal&amp;rdquo; and, as proof, gets to see the &amp;lsquo;vishwarupa&amp;rsquo; (in the mouth where the speech manifests itself) and &amp;lsquo;sees&amp;rsquo; the Cosmos (all that ever was, is and shall be) in an &amp;lsquo;I&amp;rsquo; &amp;ndash; what is the question, and what the answer?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;(1) What is called &amp;lsquo;mysticism&amp;rsquo; in the western culture is not the same &lt;em&gt;kind&lt;/em&gt; of experience that the different Indian traditions talk about. (2) I do think, as a corollary, that to describe the Indian &amp;rsquo;enlightenment&amp;rsquo; (let me use this word temporarily, the scare quotes indicate my reservations) as &amp;lsquo;mysticism&amp;rsquo; is not to understand either. (3) There are different levels in and different ways to achieve &amp;rsquo;enlightenment&amp;rsquo;. (4) It is extremely important and significant that finitely different means to achieve this state have been worked out by each of these ways. I want to go further in exploring the significance of these points and in exploring this state of &amp;rsquo;enlightenment&amp;rsquo; that the Indian traditions talk about.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>To Follow Our Forefathers: The Nature of Tradition –S.N.Balagangadhara</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While reading this contribution and all the others (&lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/translations-or-travesty-of-traditions-s-n-balagangadhara/&#34;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/why-understand-the-western-culture-s-n-balagangadhara/&#34;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;) I hope to write, we need to keep the context in mind. The context is this: many intellectuals, both in India and among the NRIs elsewhere, appear bent on transforming our multiple traditions into a single &amp;lsquo;religion&amp;rsquo; called &amp;lsquo;Hinduism&amp;rsquo;. The problem does not lie in the transformation of variety and diversity into a unity. Rather, it lies in trying to fit our traditions into the straightjacket of &amp;lsquo;religion&amp;rsquo;. While calling ourselves &amp;lsquo;Hindus&amp;rsquo; might be a convenient way of talking, the danger lies in going further and trying to develop &amp;lsquo;doctrines&amp;rsquo;, &amp;rsquo;theologies&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;catechisms&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;Ten Commandments&amp;rsquo; so that those around us in the West could recognize us as followers of a religion called &amp;lsquo;Hinduism&amp;rsquo;. (These reflections are also applicable to &amp;lsquo;Buddhism&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;Jainism&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;Saivism&amp;rsquo; and all such entities.) In the course of my future contributions, I will look at some of the compulsions that force us to manufacture &amp;lsquo;Hinduism as a religion&amp;rsquo;. In this piece, I want to focus on the nature of traditions. What is a tradition? What differentiates religions from traditions? The second question will remain implicit until the end. By that time, we should have a better understanding of what it means to speak of a tradition.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Apaurusheya, shruti and revelation: theoretical dispute</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The problem about translating &amp;lsquo;sruti&amp;rsquo; is not as easy as it has been made out to be. Is it possible to translate it as &amp;lsquo;revelation&amp;rsquo; or even as &amp;lsquo;divine revelation&amp;rsquo;? Because it has so far been translated in this manner, we can only conclude that it is indeed possible to do so. Next issue: how accurate is this translation? The answer to this question depends upon what &amp;lsquo;revelation&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;divine revelation&amp;rsquo; is supposed to mean.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What Aristotle is doing in my piece on the Indian traditions? He is doing many things actually.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;His presence is a continuation of my argument that the Antiquity (Greeks and the Romans) is not the cradle of western culture and civilization.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Aristotelian &amp;lsquo;Eudemonia&amp;rsquo; is my way of explaining his thought to the western public, which thinks that it understands Aristotle.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is a greater similarity between his notion of happiness and our notions of enlightenment than there is between him and the Christian notions of bliss.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What is ethical about pursuit of happiness (Ananda)</title>
      <link>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/what-is-ethical-about-pursuit-of-happiness-ananda/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here is what I say in my article on &amp;lsquo;how to speak for the Indian traditions&amp;rsquo;: &amp;ldquo;Our middle-aged man is, thus, raising the question of Aristotle.&amp;ldquo;I have pursued many things in life. I have acquired wealth and status, and aimed with varying degrees of success to become powerful and famous. I have been successful in some of my endeavors, while failing in yet others. I thought these things would make me happy, but I discover that, apart from moments when I felt &amp;lsquo;good&amp;rsquo;, these projects have only made me unhappy. What should I do? How should I live?&amp;rdquo; Today, these questions are not a part of ethical enquiry, any more than a quest for eudemonia is: at best, these are the &amp;rsquo;esoteric&amp;rsquo; questions and quests of &amp;rsquo;exotic&amp;rsquo; religions; at worst, one raises them with one&amp;rsquo;s psychoanalyst during a &amp;lsquo;mid-life crisis&amp;rsquo;. This situation should already indicate the distance between what is called an &amp;rsquo;ethical enquiry&amp;rsquo; today, and what Aristotle thought was the subject of all such enquiries. But that is not the focus of this piece now. However, there is no need to confuse matters by continually drawing the distinction between &amp;lsquo;modern&amp;rsquo; ethics and &amp;lsquo;Aristotelian&amp;rsquo; ethics. So, let us follow the contemporary consensus and call the quest of our middle-aged man &amp;lsquo;spiritual&amp;rsquo; (from now on without scare quotes). Seeking spirituality, and not having found it in those objects that he once so passionately pursued, he is now raising a spiritual question: in fact, he is undergoing a spiritual crisis.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Achievements of Indology: Esoteric Indian traditions</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A science of cultures is not Atmagyaana or Brahmagyaana. Let me also add that I find a quest for happiness a normal human striving.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;According to the Indian traditions, experience itself is a state of being: anubhava. In my story, so is happiness (or atmasaakshaatkaara). Need one be enlightened in order to speak about enlightenment? Should that be the case, one cannot strive for enlightenment at all and I think that enlightenment (or happiness) is a legitimate goal for human beings. If happiness is not an esoteric state of being but a legitimate goal for all human beings, there are indefinitely many roads to that state of being. The strength of the Indian traditions lies not merely in recognizing this but also in working out many such routes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The absence of supernatural entities in Indian traditions</title>
      <link>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/the-absence-of-supernatural-entities-in-indian-traditions/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/the-absence-of-supernatural-entities-in-indian-traditions/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The absence of supernatural entities in the Indian traditions may seem counterintuitive to many. We can let someone else do the talking for us, namely Dale B. Martin in his interesting book &lt;em&gt;Inventing Superstition: from the Hippocratics to the Christians&lt;/em&gt; (Harvard University Press, 2004):&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;One of the basic arguments of this book is that, contrary to many modern assumptions, the category of &amp;ldquo;the supernatural&amp;rdquo; did not exist in ancient culture &lt;em&gt;as&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;a category&lt;/em&gt;. Neither popular notions, held by the vast majority of inhabitants of the ancient world, nor philosophical notions (we could say &amp;ldquo;scientific&amp;rdquo; with due consideration for the possible anachronistic connotations of the term) assumed that reality was split up into two realms, one &amp;ldquo;natural,&amp;rdquo; containing things like &amp;ldquo;matter&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;natural forces&amp;rdquo; such as gravity or electricity, and another &amp;ldquo;supernatural,&amp;rdquo; to which gods and similar beings (demigods, angels, demons, ghosts) could be assigned&amp;hellip; What is important for this post is that the category was not available, either explicitly or by assumption, for persons in the classical Greek and Roman worlds. The Greeks and Romans certainly had no &lt;em&gt;word&lt;/em&gt; that was equivalent to the modern English &amp;ldquo;supernatural.&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip;I do not, however, want just to quibble about words. Classical Greeks and Latin had not term for what passes in the modern world as &amp;ldquo;the supernatural&amp;rdquo; precisely because the ancients did not separate out divine forces and beings from &amp;ldquo;nature&amp;rdquo; and relegate them to a separate ontological realm that could designated by its own label. Generally, for ancient people whatever does exist exists in &amp;ldquo;nature.&amp;rdquo; Almost without exception the Greek term &lt;em&gt;physis&lt;/em&gt; (nature) refers to &amp;ldquo;all that is.&amp;rdquo; People might argue that the gods did not exist or that some particular daimon or god or superhuman being did not exist (I know of no ancient author who argued for actual atheism in the modern sense). But in that case, they said that the disputed entity simply did not exist, not that it might exist in some other realm of reality, such as the &amp;ldquo;supernatural.&amp;rdquo; Ancient philosophers might argue that lightning was not caused by a god, but they did not do so by pointing out that lightning occurs in the &amp;ldquo;natural&amp;rdquo; realm and that the gods exist in the &amp;ldquo;supernatural&amp;rdquo; realm and that the two realms are not supposed to interact with one another. Ancient people took the gods and all other beings we would think of as &amp;ldquo;supernatural&amp;rdquo; to be &lt;em&gt;part&lt;/em&gt; of nature if they existed at all.&amp;rdquo; (pp. 13-15)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Is maaya an illusion? Is maaya real? Does maaya exist?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;According to your account, Vedanta claims that the &lt;em&gt;world is an illusion&lt;/em&gt; and that only the Brahman is real.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the world is an illusion, Vedanta has to deny the reality of the world. To it, in the way you construe Vedanta, the world &lt;em&gt;is the empty set&lt;/em&gt;. That is to say, all experiences are on par because they are all illusions. One cannot distinguish between experiences unless one introduces the notion of a differentiated reality. From this, it follows that a vedantin should not be able to discriminate, say, between the following: the pain you have by stubbing your toe, the pain you have when your arm is cut off without anaesthesia, and the pain you feel when your loved one dies. If he does draw a distinction between them, he is distinguishing one illusion from the other and the only way of doing that is to ascribe to these illusions the status of reality: this is &amp;rsquo;less illusory&amp;rsquo; than… this is &amp;lsquo;more real&amp;rsquo; than… this &amp;lsquo;pains more than&amp;rsquo;… this pain is &amp;lsquo;different from&amp;rsquo;…and so on. If he does not distinguish, and insists there is no difference between falling in a lake and bumping his head against a tree, who would take him seriously? Do you believe that Indians are such cretins that they would simply accept such inane stories? Surely, if &amp;lsquo;Brahman&amp;rsquo; is all there is to Vedanta, all vedantins must be perfect imbeciles. In that case, we do not need heavy-duty tantric stuff to shoot them down; a simple dose of commonsense will do.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Yoga, shudras, and women</title>
      <link>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/yoga-shudras-and-women/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;X says: Yoga practice of self attainment without the help of external deity worship so common in those days of Patanjali as today was restricted to very few as it required proper initiation from the guru and renunciation of normal humdrum lifestyle of a common man. I say man because fewer women go for that kind of ascetic lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What has self-attainment to do with worshipping the deity (whether internal or external) in the Asian (or Indian) traditions? Except for what has been talked about the Bhakti tradition (especially by the European intellectuals, and picked up later on by the Indians), &amp;lsquo;self-attainment&amp;rsquo; stands radically divorced from any notion of deity &amp;ndash; as far as one can tell. The path of yoga (to stick to what this word refers to in the popular western consciousness) is different from that of meditation or bhakti, in the sense that the former focuses on control (as against &amp;rsquo;letting go&amp;rsquo; in the Buddhist traditions for instance). Renunciation, contrasting it to the &amp;rsquo;normal humdrum lifestyle&amp;rsquo;, is a pre-requisite primarily because this &amp;lsquo;attainment&amp;rsquo; (of &amp;lsquo;self&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;knowledge&amp;rsquo;, Mukti, or whatever) is predicated upon a meta-reflection (and a deep understanding) of the &amp;lsquo;humdrum&amp;rsquo; life. Such a reflection is cognitively impossible when you are involved (entangled would perhpas be a better word here) precisely in the very dynamic on which you have to reflect.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Is enlightenment learnable?</title>
      <link>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/is-enlightenment-learnable/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:58012/hipkapi/posts/is-enlightenment-learnable/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Is enlightenment learnable? (In a less loaded formulation: Can all people be happy?) My answer is an unequivocal &amp;lsquo;yes&amp;rsquo;. Before we go further, we need to be clear what exactly this sentence says: enlightenment is not, say, the result of some genes (that explains why we get molars and not tusks, for instance), nor is it a law of nature (that explains why, say, water boils when heated and does not become gold instead) and so on. While individual psychology (and the combination of the chromosomes in each individual) does have a certain role to play in our lives, they cannot explain why I learnt something (say, English) at all. At best, if we are able to develop our understanding to the extent that we can explain such questions, they could explain why I learnt English slowly or mastered in two weeks&amp;rsquo; time. To understand why I learnt English, you have to look elsewhere: at my biography and not into the structure of my genes. However, that I could learn a natural language at all might be explained by evolutionary biology one day. But its explanation, in such a case, will encompass all human beings. It is in this sense that I say that Enlightenment is learnable or that all human beings can be happy. (This is something that out traditions have always taught and I think they are right.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When we speak about ignorance, we can do so in two ways. One is by talking about &amp;lsquo;how the world is&amp;rsquo;; the other is by talking about &amp;lsquo;how we think the world is&amp;rsquo;. Even though we could use both ways to characterize &amp;lsquo;ignorance&amp;rsquo;, they are not coextensive (or synonyms) because (a) they are about different things – in the first case it is about the world; in the second case it is about what we take to exist in the world – and, therefore, (b) they have different consequences.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Cultural difference: temporality</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Experiences are structured differently in different cultures. We believe that it is possible to give a &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt; description of this difference, at some level or the other, &lt;em&gt;as&lt;/em&gt;a difference regarding the &lt;em&gt;experience of time&lt;/em&gt; itself. Consider the traditions of Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. One of the central notions in these traditions is that of &lt;em&gt;temporality&lt;/em&gt;. That is, they believe that all events, processes, and objects are transient, irreversible, and fleeting. From this &lt;em&gt;experience&lt;/em&gt; of transience and very few assumptions about human psychology, these traditions have quasi-derived some of the most fascinating doctrines that we know of. It is worthwhile to contrast these with Judeo-Christian traditions, where this kind of temporality plays no role. It is possible to explain the &lt;em&gt;actions&lt;/em&gt; of people in these cultures, at some level of adequacy, by appealing to their conceptions and/or experiences of time. One can research on the question &amp;ldquo;does not &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt;experience of transience play a causal role in the actions they perform?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Consider the everyday &lt;em&gt;phenomenon&lt;/em&gt; of sunrise and sunset. We see the movement of the sun on the horizon and, for a very long period of time, people thought that they observed this because that is the way the reality is: the sun moves around the earth. With Galileo Galilei, two things happened. (a) He argued that the earth moves round the sun. (b) On the basis of this theory, he claimed that we are compelled to observe the movement of the sun around the earth. Because of this, a distinction became necessary: the movement of the sun is merely a phenomenon, whereas the movement of the earth is the real truth. What we previously thought as reality became downgraded to a mere appearance and something we did not know until then became the reality underlying this appearance.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, appearance is as much a part of Reality as the essence (or underlying reality, or whatever terminology you feel like using) is. So, we have three notions: appearance, the underlying reality, and the Reality that unites appearance with the underlying reality. (One might as well call them reality1, reality2 and reality3. But one does not do this because of the deep-rooted western &lt;em&gt;metaphysical assumption&lt;/em&gt; that there is only &lt;em&gt;one reality&lt;/em&gt;. However, since I do not want to quarrel with this assumption now, I will make no further remarks on this issue.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>
