      <ol>
<li>If you insist that without situating Gita in the massive text that Mahabharata is, we cannot understand or interpret Gita, then you provide such a gigantic <em>con</em>-text to the 18 chapters that the Gita is, and because a move like this can only give interpretations of a small text by situating in such a huge <em>con</em>-text, any and almost every interpretation can become valid or acceptable or permissible. We will have on our hands a plethora of interpretations, many in conflict with the other, so that we cannot even decide whether there is even one or some interpretation(s) that is (are) better than the other. We end up formulating an impossible problem: which interpretation to choose and why? We cannot appeal to the implicit goal present in text interpretations, viz., consistency and completeness nor to criterion like coherence (because it is unclear what coherence would consist of in this case).</li>
<li>Suppose that you ask the following question instead: which other texts (that is, <em>con</em>-texts) do we need to read and understand the two articles on relativity? We do need background knowledge to draw some possible implications from these articles, but what <em>con</em>-texts do we need? Which con-texts are needed to study Feynman’s Lectures, or Darwin’s origin or similar works in the natural sciences? Some knowledge is required; some skills are necessary; we must be able to read a natural language, etc., but these are not <em>con</em>-texts but requirements to acquire knowledge.</li>
<li>Suppose further that you see the Gita as a text that imparts knowledge. (I will leave out the question what that knowledge could be.) Suppose too that there are prerequisites to acquire this knowledge, as is the case with knowledge. And that we can evaluate and judge the Gita as knowledge as well. Which insurmountable problem does such an approach create? One might not be able to read the Gita and acquire the knowledge it imparts by just knowing a natural language. However, that would apply to all knowledge, would it not? You will not understand the relativity theories just because you can read those articles in, say, the original or in a faithful translation. A popular commentary that ‘explains’ these papers will not make you a physicist either. What hinders us from looking at the Gita this way? What objections are there for such an approach?</li>
<li>In fact, if you look at most claims made about the Gita (Sen, Doniger, Danto, etc.), you notice that they look at the Gita either as a literary text, or as a quasi-moral or philosophical text, or as a religious text etc. I have not come across a single interpretation of even the first chapter of the Gita that goes beyond these approaches and almost all of them tell the same story: Arjuna was despondent or felt extremely sad that he must kill (his relatives) on the battlefield and the 17 chapters of the Gita are there to ‘comfort’ him. How do they do so? The acts and consequences story is one answer. Here are my naïve questions: why write 17 chapters just to say ‘karmanyevadhikaraste…’? After all, this thought is exactly one verse long and, in fact, it is written out in the Gita. What do the other verses do? How, exactly, do these 17 chapters ‘comfort’ Arjuna and ‘therapeutically’ cure his despondency? I have not read anyone either raising these questions or answering them. (I confess that I have not read many commentaries. I am glad about this.) How does the fourth chapter (on Jnanyoga) answer any of the questions that Arjuna raises in the first chapter; what are the answers to those questions; and how exactly do these answers remove Arjuna’s despondency?</li>
<li>Such and many other questions arise if and only if you do not see the Gita as a literary, moral, philosophical, or religious text. If you see it as a knowledge text, these and many more questions arise to which the Gita attempts to give an answer. If one takes such an approach, I see its con-<em>text</em> <em>adding</em> (in some of the Parvas) explications, clarifications and reasonings that are present in extremely abbreviated forms in the Gita.</li>

      <p>One could justifiably see spirituality (the Jewish, Christian and Islamic) as ‘Adhyatma’ if one focusses on the psychological transformations that a human being undergoes in the process of moving from the mundane life to a ‘spiritual’ one. You would be closer to the notion of ‘Adhyatma’ if you can also additionally guide such a process. Such guidance requires, of course, that there is some deep understanding of such transformative processes and their mechanisms.
Yet, I would be hesitant to suggest that ‘spirituality’ translates ‘adhyatma’ or the other way round. From among the many reasons, I pick three:
(a) because the weight of the word ‘spirituality’ is drawn from Christianity, i.e., the kind of transformative force on a human being that we have in mind is the work of the ‘holy spirit’, it would be inappropriate to translate ‘adhyatma’ as ‘spirituality’;
(b) it is difficult to characterize the changes in human beings that we are talking about by using this word in Islam and Judaism as well. There is no ‘holy spirit’ in these two religions that does the work of the Trinitarian holy spirit;
(c) since a ‘spiritual’ person is the result of the workings of the holy spirit, in the context of Adhyatma which insists that transformations are the results of human phenomena working on human beings, the use of this word would be inappropriate. Both the Christian and the Adhyatmic use militates against such a translation.
In short, no, we should not translate ‘spirituality’ as ‘adhyatma’.</p>

      <p>It is broadly accepted that one of the most important functions of language is to describe the world outside it. Could it be the case that when it comes to the Indian systems, they all (whether it is Advaita vedanta, Yoga vasistha, visista advaita) are teaching one to act, to live in a particular way? In other words, they are not saying what there is in the world but are manuals in a manner of speaking. Of course, in order to understand a manual you need reference points in the world. So when they say for example that when the Buddha argued for <em>anatman</em> or Sankara spoke about <em>atman</em>, one way of interpreting, which is what most Indian philosophers have done, is that they attribute doctrines to them and say this is a description of the world. But actually they were not describing the world. Buddha does not say atman exists or does not exist or whatever. Sankara is not saying <em>atman</em> exists because that would be a description of our world. So what a guru does in our tradition, which is what the upadesa is, is to teach one to not look at these as descriptions of the world; he teaches one how to transform them into a way of living. So Yoga vasistha does not tell you what the world is like. That can be said in one sentence. Why then does this man have to write so much? It is to help you go on in a certain way and then say that this is not a description of the world.

In spite of the demands of daily life, Indian Americans find the time and energy to engage in intellectual debates about the nature of their traditions. In spite of the discrimination and &ldquo;religion oppression&rdquo; [1] faced by them, there is a general sense of optimism about the future of these traditions.
It is important that this dynamism remain a positive force. Some Indian Americans have adopted the name-calling that we find among certain American academics. Whereas the latter call anyone who dares say a few positive words about the Indian traditions &ldquo;a Hindutva sycophant,&rdquo; the former trend to label any western intellectual who dares question the dominant representations of the Indian traditions as a &ldquo;Witzellian.&rdquo; The legitimate discontent about the academic representation of the Indian traditions should not lead us to a general anti-intellectual stance. Anti-intellectualism knows only one endpoint: the <em>Taliban</em>. Now, if there is one community aware of the duty to avoid that society moves towards that point, it is the Indian American community. Since intellectuals share this sense of duty, our study of the Indian traditions should show how they can contribute to making American society a more tolerant, open-minded and happier society.
As Chitra Raman affirms, the Indian traditions have been conceptualized in an extremely impoverished manner during the last few centuries. It is the hypothesis of our research group that this is the case because they have been viewed <em>through a secularized biblical framework</em>. [2] The same framework also puts conceptual limitations on the structure of American pluralism. This is not an assessment about the origins of this form of pluralism or a judgment about its biased nature, but rather a <em>cognitive</em> analysis of its contemporary structure. Such an analysis cannot be challenged by a moralizing judgement (e.g., that it justifies discrimination). The only way to really challenge my hypothesis is to develop another hypothesis about the structure of American pluralism. Naturally, its purpose is to develop new ways of solving the problems of pluralism in the U.S. To do so, one should indeed strive to bring American pluralism beyond its biblical straitjacket in the near future. Perhaps, no group is as qualified to do so as the Indian Americans.
But before they can take up this task, they should understand the depth of the predicament. Even more so, they have to become aware that they have appropriated the secularized Christian conception of the Indian traditions as a self-description. The predicament we face is <em>cognitive</em> in nature: the currently dominant conception of the Indian traditions makes sense only against the background of the biblical framework. It is cognitive in the sense that the way we currently think and talk about “Hinduism” leads to a distortion of the very nature of the Indian traditions. This dominant conception of “Hinduism” does not describe these traditions themselves, but rather <em>how they appear through western and Christian lenses</em>. Yet many Indians and Indian Americans talk as though this conception makes eminent sense to them.
Chitra Raman develops a nice analogy: it is like using the grammar of one language to understand another. One may adopt the words of the second language, but when one embeds them in the grammatical structure of the first language, one ends up with virtual gibberish. The analogy can be taken further: today, it is as though the native speakers of the second language have accepted the grammatical structure of the first language as the only correct one and they try to speak their own language in this way. This is the nature of our predicament: many Indians and Indian Americans have adopted the conceptual framework of Christianity to talk about their own traditions. They assume the Indian traditions are a belief system or religion with its own doctrines, commandments and rules. As I will try to show, this makes about as much sense as using the grammatical structure of one language to speak another completely different language.
To avoid any misunderstanding, let it be clear that the denial that the Indian traditions are of the same nature as biblical religion does not involve any value judgement. They also have a highly-developed structure, but this is so different from Judaism, Christianity and Islam that it is impossible to maintain that the Indian traditions and the latter three are instances of the same kind. In fact, once we appreciate how different the Indian traditions are from these religions, we will rediscover how rich and valuable they really are. To return to the language analogy: if we used the grammatical structure of one language to speak another, we would not be able to understand this second language and would also ignore its rich contributions to literature, philosophy and poetry. It is only when we rediscover the structure of this second language that its treasures become available to us. Similarly, when we rediscover the nature of the Indian traditions and rescue them from being transformed into just another religion, we will be able to show how they have contributed to the pursuit of knowledge at a level undreamt of.
<em><strong>The Priest and the Swami</strong></em>
In <em>Facing the Challenge of American Pluralism</em>, I argued that the Indian traditions revolve around the exploring and examining of one’s experience so as to attain perfect happiness. What does this mean? How is it different from what religions like Christianity and Islam do? As an entry point, take a Hindu swamiji and a Christian priest. The priest says “God is a Trinity.” The swamiji says “<em>Tat Tvam Asi</em>.” What is the difference between the two?
First the priest. The sentence “God is a Trinity” is a doctrine to him; it is a proposition about the world, which he takes to be absolutely true. Because it is a doctrine, the sentence is embedded in an elaborate theological system. It is related to other sentences that explain its true meaning: theological doctrines about Jesus being the Son of God and the Father, the Son and the Spirit being one substance, but three persons. Arguments have been developed to establish the truth of the Trinitarian doctrine. Its correct formulation was discussed and fixed at the First Council of Nicea in 325 AD. The result is the Nicene Creed: a set of beliefs that are held to reflect religious truth by most Christian denominations. As a Christian believer, when the priest says “God is a Trinity,” one is expected to accept this as a true belief, a doctrine embedded in a belief system that claims the one and only religious truth. As an orthodox Christian today, one should understand this doctrine, proclaim its truth and be able to defend it against its detractors. One should not question its truth and meaning. These have been fixed for good.
Now the swamiji. When he states “<em>Tat Tvam Asi</em>,<em>”</em> does he expect all Hindus to accept this sentence as a true doctrine? Does he want them to take this as a true belief, whose truth they should proclaim and defend against the “false beliefs” of other religions? Does he expect them to memorize the sentence and its related doctrines and arguments, and repeat them until eternity? No, he does not. When the swamiji teaches, he takes into account the different levels and experiences of his audience. He will explain “<em>Tat Tvam Asi</em>” in different ways according to the different experiential levels of individuals. The sentence does not have one fixed true meaning, precisely because it functions as an instruction for exploring one’s own experience. It suggests that the distinction between I and not-I is a temporary figment that results from interpreting our experience in a particular way. If we examine this experience at a deeper level, we will slowly discover that there is no such distinction there. The swamiji’s explanation of the sentence will make sense to us, according to where we are on the path towards this discovery.
Hence, neither the speech of the <em>swamiji</em> nor the texts of the Indian traditions can be understood as belief systems or doctrines, which have a fixed meaning and claim to reflect the one religious truth. They are “heuristics” that function as instructions for action to explore our own experience. To attain the insights embodied in these sentences, one has to examine them from all sides, relate them to one’s experience and question their truth repeatedly. Only in this way can they help us become better and happier human beings. The claim of the Indian traditions is not that we should accept them as true doctrines or that such acceptance is a precondition for attaining salvation. They do not postpone perfect happiness until after death. Neither do they claim that there is only one true path to attain this state. Rather, they claim that all human beings can attain perfect happiness here on earth and that there are countless ways to achieve this goal.
Those who conceptualize the Indian traditions as “belief systems,” “doctrines” or “religion” take away the unique nature of these traditions. They make the rich storehouse of experiential knowledge embodied by these traditions inaccessible and do so by transforming them into a belief system, the Hindu equivalent of Christianity or Islam. Let it be clear that the Indian traditions are neither belief systems nor religions. They are far more fascinating than that. I refer you to the piece by my teacher S. N. Balagangadhara (soon to be published on the India Forum website) to get a glimpse of how rich these traditions are. Here, just note that it is <em>precisely the way in which the Indian traditions are different from belief systems, which makes them into extremely important but uncharted contributions to the human pursuit of knowledge</em>.
<em><strong>Transforming the Swami into a Priest</strong></em>
But what happens when we reduce the Indian traditions into a Hindu “religion,” “world view” or “belief system”? What are the consequences of transforming the swamiji into a priest? Why is this development so harmful?</p>

      <p>Some Swamiji claims: “One cannot experience the Atman[, the Atman] is the witness, it is what experiences.”</p>
<p>Obviously, this is a very rough and approximate formulation. This statement is both wrong and right in different ways. (a) In the very early days, when I began to develop my meditation exercise, I ‘sensed’ the vague presence of an observer (somewhere present in the background of my experiential world). Or, you could say, I vaguely sensed that I was being ‘seen’ or that my meditative performance was being performed for an ‘outside’ observer. Perhaps, it would also be accurate to say that I sensed its vague presence outside my meditative world, but touching upon its edges. Later, when I was trying to help other people meditate, I discovered that some sensed this presence too and yet others had to ‘let go’ in order to sense this presence. I am guessing that this is the idea of Atman as a ‘witness’. Some were fearful and afraid of this presence as well. If you say that to sense the vague presence is to experience that presence, the Swamiji is wrong. If you see this vague sensing of a presence (or sensing the vague presence of something) as not experiencing, the Swamij would be right. (b) Does the Atman experience? If you keep the word ‘experience’ sufficiently broad (or nebulous), yes, that is true. Self-awareness is obviously ‘aware’ (working purely at a linguistic level); self-consciousness is obviously ‘conscious’ (I say this in my note as well to understand the access). In this sense, yes, the Swamiji is right. However, the Swamiji is wrong if we claim, which we have to, that experience (as we know it today) requires some kind of bodily constraint (i.e. the presence of an apparatus to experience). We have to say here that self-consciousness is not tantamount to ‘experience’. Then the question opens up: if self-consciousness is not ‘experience’ what else is it? I have no answer except to say that it is ‘self-consciousness’, period. It is also further true, on both accounts, that <strong>sentience does not experience self-consciousness but merely accesses it.</strong> In that case, the next problem: what does this access generate? Some or another kind of experience or not? If we cannot provide some kind of a satisfactory answer, the word ‘access’ is an occult word and does no work. (These are not the only set of problems, but it does indicate why understanding ‘enlightenment’ is far, far more difficult than achieving that state.)</p>

      <p>Consider the fact that the Indian ‘gods’ are portrayed in at least two ways. First, there is their portrayal with four arms (say) and there is their portrayal in completely human forms. Krishna has four arms (with Shankha, Chakra, Gada and Padma or one hand with a blessing palm or downward indicating a mudra of some kind) and he also has a fully human form. The balakrishna’s I have seen give him only two arms. So do many images of Krishna: he has only two arms. However, apart from other symbols (flute, peacock feather, etc), his colour is almost invariant. Ganesha is even more interesting: there are balaganesha’s crawling with two arms and with four arms. There are images of a four-armed Ganesha sitting on the lap of a two-armed Shiva (with and without his third eye but holding a trishula). In any case, he has the elephant head. Most Durga’s have multiple arms, a few frightening heads but there are also those with human form and pretty faces. Same applies to Parvati, Laxmi and Saraswati. Except, of course, they invariably have pretty faces. They too have characteristic traits: seated on Padma, carrying a Veena, or next to Shiva or Ganesha or sitting on top of a mountain surrounded by snowy peaks. There are also others where she is on a peetha or is very well dressed and adorned with ornaments. In short, some or another trait is mostly present that identifies which ‘goddess’ or ‘god’ s/he is. The rest, obviously, is left free. Of course, there are also images that can only be identified, if so identified by local stories, the pujari’s at the temples and so on. If these are our ‘popular gods’, the less-known (say the village ‘goddesses’) are even more problematic. Many village ‘goddesses’ look similarly vague and are almost but not quite amorphous.</p>

<p>Actually, there are two questions that need to be distinguished from each other. There is, firstly, the question about the nature of &lsquo;Eastern&rsquo; Christianity. If it is muted in its proselytizing drive in all cultures the <em>same way</em> and if it is &rsquo;tolerant&rsquo; in <em>exactly the same way</em> in all cultures, it makes sense to ask the question whether (a) different factors in all these cultures have brought about the same effect (different &lsquo;causes&rsquo; can generate one and the same effect in differing circumstances) or (b) it is due to the nature of the &lsquo;Eastern&rsquo; Christianity itself. Nobody is able to make such a claim today. We do not possess the theoretical apparatus which would allow us to make sense of the remarks I have made in italics.</p>

<p>Christianity (to some extent Judaism), presented an idea, unknown to the world in which it grew, namely the Pagan world of Rome. The idea was that human beings are creatures of God and that they belonged to His domain. He was the dominus or the Lord of the domain. As a result, human beings should not be arrogant, but must be humble instead. (As the ‘Book of Job’ in the Old Testament makes it clear, there is a very heavy price to be paid for arrogance.) Here, it belonged to the opposite spectrum in Ancient thought, which saw arrogance as a moral virtue and humility as a despicable vice. Protestant Christianity, especially Luther and Calvin, very forcefully propagated this idea: Man was a sinner, worse than the lowest worm, because of which God’s Grace becomes unfathomable and ungraspable.</p>

      <p>If the ‘I’ cannot be individuated or described, then there is no possible distinction between the ‘I’ and ‘the Brahman’. They are different names for ‘self-awareness’ which pick out the differential access that individuals have to ‘self-awareness’. Hence, the curious distinction that some Indian traditions make. On the one hand, the ‘I’ is alleged to be identical with the ‘Brahman’; on the other, the same traditions distinguish between ‘Atmagyaana’ and ‘Brahmagyaana’. These two ‘gyanaas’ can be two types of knowledge, if, on one reading, they are knowledge about two different objects, namely ‘atman’ and ‘Brahman’. If, however, they are identical, there could be only one knowledge. Second, even that is not possible. We can only have knowledge of something, if that something exists. If Atman or Brahman exist in this Universe, they are also subject to the processes that occur here. One such is decay and disintegration. Therefore, if we think this problem through, there is only one conclusion possible (if we assume that all Indians have not always been imbeciles): the gyaana is about the processes of accessing the real. It is not and cannot be about the real.
This means that the debate within the Indian traditions is not and could not have been about the nature of ‘atman’ or ‘Brahman’. Thus, the idea that is propagated as ‘the’ truth about the alleged conflict between the dvaita and the advaita is spurious and false. There was clearly debates and conflicts. But these cannot be about the nature of the real.
The same is true about the alleged conflict between ‘Buddhism’ and ‘Brahmanism’. Atman and Anatman are not conflicting doctrines about the real at all; they could not be. It is logically impossible that this was the debate between representatives of these traditions, unless we assume that Indians are congenitally incapable of thinking logically,. Those who sell this story, whether in India or abroad, the western savants and their Indian slaves, are the truly perfect imbeciles, which they actually think that Indians are. These idiots are our professors and many guru’s in India and elsewhere.
Thus, we see that Ambedkar and the Ambedkarites (in India and elsewhere today) are total slaves of their western masters. To ‘convert’ from ‘Hinduism’ to ‘Buddhism’, as though they are conflicting religions, is to simply ape the western cretins who have been selling this story for nearly 200 years. Of course, the Ambedkarites do that because their fame and fortune depends on slavery. They would rather be slaves of cretins than live free as thinking human beings. The western ‘thinkers’ in the US fete them because they love the adulation and adoration they get from these Indians. And, as is the case with Pollock, they are “friends with benefits” with Indians:  getting millions of dollars from idiots like Narayan Murthy and receiving national awards from the Indian government.</p>

      <p>You say: &ldquo;there seems to be an underlying assumption that all participants in the thread seem to be making. The assumption being that all these texts have the same end goal in mind, and that this end goal is enlightenment/eudaimonia/happiness. I submit that such an assumption is unwarranted.&rdquo;</p>
<ol>
<li>It is not an assumption but an explicit hypothesis, as far as I am concerned, that all the Indian traditions (not just these two sets of texts, namely, Upanishads and Puranas) are concerned with the same end goal. I want to provide a description of the Indian traditions as attempts to help human beings find happiness on earth. (For the time being, in order to avoid fruitless controversies and to have a point of departure, I take Aristotelian Eudaimonia to be an explication of this notion of happiness.)</li>
<li>Assumptions often do require warrant, but hypotheses do not. Because the truth of a conclusion depends on the truth of the premise (often, assumptions function as premises in an argument) provided valid rules of inferences are used, it makes sense to ask for the warrant of an assumption. Needless to say, this condition does not hold for hypotheses: you have to evaluate them entirely differently.</li>
<li>Of course, in one sense, such a reconstruction would be the hypothesis I propose. Until such stage, the belief about the commonality of the goal of the Indian traditions would be an assumption. However, it is not a premise in a logical deduction but one which functions as a heuristic. Consequently, if I need to convince you to accept this assumption for the time being, I need to show you what is cognitively interesting about this assumption.</li>
<li>It promises to help explain the rivalry within the Indian traditions; it sheds new light on the inter-relationship between them in a different way than as &lsquo;syncretism&rsquo;; it helps one look for a set of problems underlying the Indian traditions; it allows one to formulate these problems in the twenty-first century language; it helps one evaluate the answers of these traditions and even carry them forward. These are some of the cognitive benefits of this assumption.</li>
<li>Of course, ultimately, it might turn out to be the case that no such goal is to be found and that the Indian traditions are not each other&rsquo;s rivals. I do not know. For the time being, this idea appears very productive. That is enough of a warrant.

      <p>If you want to use <strong>Nirvana Shatkam</strong>*,* it might be more productive to choose translations which do the job that the text can. Because of that, a ‘faithful’ translation of Sanskrit into English is not the primary requirement; the process and the goal should determine how the words are best understood. With this in mind, some suggestions regarding the translation of the Sanskrit verses.</p>
<p>It is important to notice that the words in these verses refer to components (physical, physiological, psychological, etc.). Therefore, assume that human ‘mind’ (or human psychology) is referred to (or spoken of) in modular terms.</p>

      <p><em>Editor&rsquo;s note: This article appeared in the Journal of American Academy of Religion</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Abstract</strong></em></p>
<p>The paper attempts a contrast between the process and the structure of the Christian and the Indian spirituality. Drawing attention to their dissimilarities, it attempts to reformulate the differences among the Indian traditions in a novel way. It argues that cultures and traditions are not just different; but that they differ from each other in different ways as well. The future of religious studies, it is suggested, is dependent on developing the ability to develop new ways of describing the differences between cultures and traditions. This is the agenda for the future. As a correlate to this task, the paper suggests that we replace the question &ldquo;who speaks &lsquo;for&rsquo; and &lsquo;about&rsquo; a religion?&rdquo; with a more pregnant and a more accurate reformulation: &ldquo;how to speak for a religion in the Academy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Sanskrit word (that I know) that comes closest to the Greek &rsquo;telos&rsquo; is &lsquo;Sankalpa&rsquo;. It means &rsquo;to mentally determine&rsquo;, &lsquo;formulation of an end&rsquo; &lsquo;desirous of (an end)&rsquo;, &lsquo;anticipation (of an end)&rsquo; etc. It also means &lsquo;Buddhi&rsquo; in some contexts.</p>

<p>One of the primary properties of religion is that it <em>generates</em> questions about &ldquo;the meaning and purpose of life&rdquo;, &ldquo;meaning and purpose of existence&rdquo; and such like, both at an individual level and at the level of a culture.</p>

      <p>The problem with the advaita tradition today is its lack of intelligibility. &lsquo;Maya&rsquo;, for instance, does a tremendous lot of explanatory work, but it is hardly clear what it is; multiple concepts like &lsquo;manas&rsquo;, &lsquo;buddhi&rsquo; and &lsquo;chitta&rsquo; occur and we do not know how these concepts relate to each other, whether they refer, whether they are a part of psychological theorizing or merely an exercise in philosophical anthropology. It is further unclear whether they are &lsquo;psychological faculties&rsquo; or theoretical terms. The nature of &lsquo;atman&rsquo; is unclear: is it a physical body or non-physical body? What its relationship to the organic body? Is it a form of monism (&rsquo;everything is atman&rsquo;) or dualism (&lsquo;atman is the sovereign&rsquo;) or something entirely different altogether? How do these terms relate to the different forms of psychological theories we have: from commonsense psychology to cognitive science? Further, it is unclear too what gets reborn if &lsquo;punarjanma&rsquo; means rebirth. If atman is not the organic body, is it an emergent property of the brain, or of consciousness? If not, how can it ever become &lsquo;self-conscious&rsquo;? And, of course, there is the preoccupation whether Advaita is compatible with the results of scientific research. These are merely some of the reasons why Advaita lacks intelligibility today.</p>

<p>As I have often said, the most intriguing aspect of the Indian culture is the kind of knowledge it produced and encouraged people to produce: experiential knowledge which emerges by systematically reflecting on our (human) experiences in the world. As human beings, our experiences are many: no one set, no one kind of experience exhausts what we go through. From the purely personal experiences of the world (our ambitions, hopes, dreams, frustrations, etc) to the entirely social ones (the experiences of sorrow and injustice that other human beings in the world experience). So, knowledge that reflects on or thinks about and systematizes such experiences presupposes multiple learning sites, many diverse perspectives and varied kinds of intellectual skills.</p>

<p>Before deciding about whether or not Vivekananda was ethnocentric, jingoistic or even plain intolerant, one has to understand what Vivekananda was saying. In doing so, the interpretative &ldquo;principle of charity&rdquo; requires us to render him maximally consistent.</p>

<li>
<p>Consider the title of this thread: &ldquo;All religions are true&rdquo;. Spelling-out Vivekananda&rsquo;s stance regarding this theme presupposes the ability to provide convincing answers to questions about what Vivekananda thought &ldquo;religion&rdquo; was, what &ldquo;truth&rdquo; was, and how the latter relates to the former.</p>

<p>When we consider  Paul Hacker&rsquo;s story on &lsquo;inclusivism as a typically Indian thought form&rsquo;, all we can conclude is that he has used a <em>typically Christian  thought form</em> to understand an aspect of the Indian cultural traditions, which he is unable to understand because it is completely different from what he knows. Hacker&rsquo;s inclusivism is merely an attempt to strip the following Christian account from its recognizably Christian characteristics: &ldquo;When God created man he inscribed him with a sense of divinity, and when it is <em>not corrupted</em> this sense is the true religion. Throughout human history the devil and his minions corrupted this sense of divinity into false religion or worship of the devil among all human peoples. Until the good Lord brought mankind back to the true religion by revealing himself in Jesus Christ. Thus, Christianity is the one true religion. It is the message of self-disclosure in which God reveals his Will for the universe to the humankind. Of course, all other traditions contain traces of divine revelation, but these are nothing but the preparation of the Gospel. Once the true religion was revealed again, all non-Christian traditions could be nothing but pale and erring variants of Christianity.&rdquo; Now Hacker has merely taken this Christian conceptual scheme to make sense of the attitude the Indian traditions take towards other traditions. Although it happens unconsciously most of the time, this is <em>the basic method of Indology</em>: one looks at the Indian traditions, and the only way to make sense of them is to make them fit into a conceptual framework of secularized Christian theology.</p>
