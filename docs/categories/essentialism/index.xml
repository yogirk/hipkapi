Last Wednesday he lost his battle with cancer. The influence of this Palestinian writer in all areas of the social sciences of the last quarter century is immense. Many will remember him from Delhi to Dar Es Salaam, from Paris to Chicago; many will also write in memoriams.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Criticism: you are essentializing cultures!</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The first question: &amp;ldquo;By saying that there exist &amp;ldquo;Western&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Indian&amp;rdquo; cultures aren&amp;rsquo;t you somehow essentializing cultures into monoliths?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I do not see how. When we talk of &amp;rsquo;the human species&amp;rsquo; (in the singular), or about &amp;rsquo;life&amp;rsquo; (again in the singular) while doing evolutionary biology, we do not presuppose or imply that either of the two is a monolithic entity, do we? In fact, &lt;em&gt;diversity&lt;/em&gt; is a presupposition for any kind of knowledge and this is my presupposition as well. I presuppose (and my theory requires) diversity in both the Indian and the western culture. Without it, one cannot test the theories.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Vacuity of Essentialism?—S.N.Balagangadhara</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have had difficulties in understanding the use and meaning of some words, especially &amp;rsquo;essentialism&amp;rsquo; and its cognates. Here are some uses of &amp;ldquo;essentialism&amp;rdquo; I am familiar with.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;One uses &amp;rsquo;essences&amp;rsquo; to designate some basic or fundamental or determining properties of an object, as in: &amp;ldquo;Water is essentially H2O&amp;rdquo;. Here the claim is that some liquid is water if and only if it has the chemical structure of containing two molecules of Hydrogen and one molecule of Oxygen for every single molecule of the liquid in question.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;One uses &amp;rsquo;essences&amp;rsquo; in order to understand counterfactual sentences involving proper nouns, as in: &amp;ldquo;If I were George Bush, I would not have gone to war with Iraq&amp;rdquo;. This sentence is a counterfactual because it begins by assuming a non-fact (I am Balu and not George Bush); picks out a state of affairs where this is true (a possible world where &amp;lsquo;Balu&amp;rsquo; IS &amp;lsquo;George Bush&amp;rsquo;) and makes a (true or false) statement about this (I might or might not have gone to war with Iraq). Many historical claims (and many scientific laws) have the form of counterfactual statements. Here &amp;rsquo;essence&amp;rsquo; is predicated to Balu (something like &amp;ldquo;baluhood&amp;rdquo;) so that Balu remains Balu even if he were to become &amp;lsquo;George Bush&amp;rsquo; in some possible world.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;One uses &amp;rsquo;essences&amp;rsquo; to solve the problem of providing references to proper names, as in &amp;ldquo;Socrates was not a teacher of Plato&amp;rdquo;. In many cases, we identify Socrates as that person who has the property of &amp;lsquo;being a teacher of Plato&amp;rsquo;. If it transpires that such is not the case, we will still not be in doubt about the identity of Socrates because, much like the previous case, it speaks about some &amp;rsquo;essential property&amp;rsquo; of Socrates by virtue of which he remains the same person even when he does not have some or another accidental or contingent property.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;One uses &amp;rsquo;essences&amp;rsquo; while solving the puzzle of identity, as in &amp;ldquo;This is me, a photograph taken when I was three years old&amp;rdquo;. Here, &amp;lsquo;me, when I was three years old&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;me in America during the 1990 AAR conference&amp;rsquo; etc. become spatio-temporal slices of an &amp;lsquo;I&amp;rsquo;. The &amp;lsquo;I&amp;rsquo; has indefinitely many spatio-temporal slices and these are all slices of one and the same &amp;lsquo;I&amp;rsquo;. The idea is that one does not become someone else other than who one is because of the spatio-temporal career of &amp;lsquo;oneself&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even though there are many discussions about each of these uses, there is nothing wrong or illegitimate about using the word &amp;rsquo;essence&amp;rsquo; or indeed to &amp;ldquo;talk in an essentializing way&amp;rdquo;. Quite obviously, the &amp;lsquo;subaltern&amp;rsquo; historiographers could not mean &amp;rsquo;essentialism&amp;rsquo; in any of the above senses, because they suggest that essentialism is something to avoid. I know of one such use of the word in Said&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Orientalism&amp;rdquo;, where he suggests that to correlate climatic conditions with the psychology or culture of a people (something that often happened in the eighteenth nineteenth centuries) is to commit the sin of essentialism. Clearly, this is not the kind of essentialism that is at issue here.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
