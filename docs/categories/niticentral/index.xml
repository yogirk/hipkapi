      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rape of a Country&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Jakob De Roover&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt; Imagine. A filmmaker travels to Belgium because she has heard about the pedophilia scandals in the country. She directs a documentary film including an interview with an infamous pedophile, who says that the girls he raped had actually seduced him and that they really enjoyed it. The filmmaker then comments that Belgian society is responsible for creating such pedophiles by teaching them what to think. Most men in this country are programmed in this way, she insists. In fact, this is all part of a larger disease and culture, which is also reflected in Belgian cinema. How would we Belgians react? We would find this shocking and infuriating. It is as though pedophilia is an expression of the core of our culture, as though we are programmed for child abuse.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
