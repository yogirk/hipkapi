      <description>&lt;p&gt;I keep teaching my students the need to unlearn: unlearn the desire to &amp;lsquo;show off&amp;rsquo; their erudition; unlearn shallowness and so on. I am more than convinced that whatever we have learnt about human beings can be formulated in a jargon-free language and in a simple manner. There is no need to appear &amp;lsquo;mysterious and profound&amp;rsquo;; nor is there a need for exhibiting one&amp;rsquo;s erudition or &amp;lsquo;critical capacities&amp;rsquo;. On all these counts, most of Foucalt&amp;rsquo;s writings (and that of his commentators) can only call forth anger and irritation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How would one translate the word &#39;God&#39; into, say, Sanskrit?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here is the question: How would one translate the word &amp;lsquo;God&amp;rsquo; into, say, Sanskrit? Now, the answer has to satisfy certain conditions because the question also meets certain conditions. Let me say very clearly what all these are, so that the playground and the rules are transparent and favour no one party in the dispute.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I propose we accept the best theory of meaning that exists in the market place. As far as I know, the book that plays this role most admirably, while satisfying the proponents of different theories of meaning expounded during the last century or so, is Prashant Parikh&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Language and Equilibrium&amp;rdquo; (The MIT press, 2010). His formal apparatus allows for the existence of &amp;lsquo;word meanings&amp;rsquo; without sacrificing the idea that the meaning of sentences are context-dependent and makes sense of even such statements as &amp;ldquo;the meaning of red light is&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; That is to say, it does not restrict &amp;lsquo;meaning&amp;rsquo; to words and sentences alone; it also allows us to deal with &amp;lsquo;word meaning&amp;rsquo; as well, as it is in our case. If my colleagues unanimously prefer another &amp;rsquo;theory of meaning&amp;rsquo;, I would like to know what it is. In all probability, I would not take issue with an alternate choice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Bullshit: True Sentences and Trivialization of Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://yogirk.github.io/hipkapi/posts/bullshit-true-sentences-and-knowledge-balagangadhara/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Why understanding bullshit is important?  Three reasons: (a) there is a very frequent use of the word ‘bullshit’ (mostly in my posts); (b) bullshit has been tied directly to truth in the literature on the subject, (c) far more important is the fact that it is much more connected to &lt;em&gt;knowledge&lt;/em&gt; than has so far been acknowledged. In this post, the focus is on the third reason.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, an ‘autobiographical’ point: I was charmed by how Akeel Bilgrami spoke about ‘bullshit’, when we met each other for the first time. Akeel also said that we call this ‘bakwas’ in Hindi. This resulted in revisiting &lt;a href=&#34;http://www2.csudh.edu/ccauthen/576f12/frankfurt__harry_-_on_bullshit.pdf&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Harry Frankfurt’s article on the issue&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;; it further led to reading the late &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ditext.com/cohen/Cohen.pdf&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;G.A. Cohen’s contribution on the topic&lt;/a&gt;&#xA; and going through most of the literature on the subject. (Some interesting stuff on the theme is collected in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Bullshit-Philosophy-Guaranteed-Perfect-Results/dp/0812696115&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;an edited volume&lt;/a&gt;&#xA; on the subject that was published a few years ago.) Since then, some on and off thinking on the subject has been going on, some of whose results you shall notice in this post.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Humility is a despicable vice</title>
      <link>https://yogirk.github.io/hipkapi/posts/humility-is-a-vice/</link>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Christianity (to some extent Judaism), presented an idea, unknown to the world in which it grew, namely the Pagan world of Rome. The idea was that human beings are creatures of God and that they belonged to His domain. He was the dominus or the Lord of the domain. As a result, human beings should not be arrogant, but must be humble instead. (As the ‘Book of Job’ in the Old Testament makes it clear, there is a very heavy price to be paid for arrogance.) Here, it belonged to the opposite spectrum in Ancient thought, which saw arrogance as a moral virtue and humility as a despicable vice. Protestant Christianity, especially Luther and Calvin, very forcefully propagated this idea: Man was a sinner, worse than the lowest worm, because of which God’s Grace becomes unfathomable and ungraspable.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Two kinds of research in social sciences</title>
      <link>https://yogirk.github.io/hipkapi/posts/two-kinds-of-research-in-social-sciences/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is, on the one hand, the intellectual tradition of expressing opinions and points of view. Here, as it suits thoughtful minds, one tries to express ideas carefully and in a nuanced fashion. Recent peer-opinions are taken into account; generalizations are avoided; the attention is on the specific and the concrete; and, where possible, one’s ideas are either founded upon or embroidered by some or another of the many philosophical stances that are available. The goal of the discussion is to endorse these opinions, or express disagreement on the broad idea expressed by the author. Any other kind of intellectual exercise of often seen as either nit-picking or engaging in polemics. To those who have grown up in this culture, it is obvious what the sought-after intellectual virtues are and how one should cultivate it. In other words, this culture surrounds itself with meta-arguments that is either founded upon or embroidered by some or another meta-philosophy about what intellectuals are, what their role in the realm of ideas should be and how they should relate to the rest of society.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why Insider/Outsider game is sterile?—S.N.Balagangadhara</title>
      <link>https://yogirk.github.io/hipkapi/posts/why-insideroutsider-game-is-sterile-s-n-balagangadhara/</link>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first point is the difficulty involved in specifying what the &amp;ldquo;real meaning of an experience&amp;rdquo; consists of. Asking an insider would not help us here: the insider may or may not know what the real meaning of his/her own experience is or even how to go about putting it in words.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Assuming that the first problem somehow gets solved, the second problem lies in the &lt;em&gt;multiplicities&lt;/em&gt; of such meanings: if people differ on what any particular experience means to them (for instance, what doing Puja to Ganesha means to my brother does not mean the same to my sister), which should we choose and for what reason? This problem is virtually unsolvable, especially when you take the interpretations of the past into consideration as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Denying Experience: Do Hindus ‘worship’? Do they do Pooja to phallus (linga)?</title>
      <link>https://yogirk.github.io/hipkapi/posts/denying-experience-do-hindoos-worship-do-they-do-pooja-to-a-phalluslinga-s-n-balagangadhara/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Someone, let&amp;rsquo;s say her name is Wendy Doniger, comes along and sniggers &amp;lsquo;when you worship the lingam, you worship a phallus&amp;rsquo;. I do not identify Wendy&amp;rsquo;s statement as an &amp;lsquo;ad hoc&amp;rsquo; explanation. I say that it trivializes what I am doing by providing a distorted description of what I do. Here is what I say: &amp;ldquo;I am doing Puja to Shiva.&amp;rdquo; No discussion about &amp;lsquo;Lingam&amp;rsquo; or its many meanings. This is a &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt; way of conducting a discussion. She cannot, therefore, argue that I am giving an &amp;lsquo;ad hoc&amp;rsquo; explanation because I am not giving an &amp;rsquo;explanation&amp;rsquo; of what I am doing but merely describing it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
