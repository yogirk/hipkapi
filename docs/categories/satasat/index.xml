They are different names for ‘self-awareness’ which pick out the differential access that individuals have to ‘self-awareness’. Hence, the curious distinction that some Indian traditions make. On the one hand, the ‘I’ is alleged to be identical with the ‘Brahman’; on the other, the same traditions distinguish between ‘Atmagyaana’ and ‘Brahmagyaana’. These two ‘gyanaas’ can be two types of knowledge, if, on one reading, they are knowledge about two different objects, namely ‘atman’ and ‘Brahman’. If, however, they are identical, there could be only one knowledge. Second, even that is not possible. We can only have knowledge of something, if that something exists. If Atman or Brahman exist in this Universe, they are also subject to the processes that occur here. One such is decay and disintegration. Therefore, if we think this problem through, there is only one conclusion possible (if we assume that all Indians have not always been imbeciles): the gyaana is about the processes of accessing the real. It is not and cannot be about the real.
This means that the debate within the Indian traditions is not and could not have been about the nature of ‘atman’ or ‘Brahman’. Thus, the idea that is propagated as ‘the’ truth about the alleged conflict between the dvaita and the advaita is spurious and false. There was clearly debates and conflicts. But these cannot be about the nature of the real.
The same is true about the alleged conflict between ‘Buddhism’ and ‘Brahmanism’. Atman and Anatman are not conflicting doctrines about the real at all; they could not be. It is logically impossible that this was the debate between representatives of these traditions, unless we assume that Indians are congenitally incapable of thinking logically,. Those who sell this story, whether in India or abroad, the western savants and their Indian slaves, are the truly perfect imbeciles, which they actually think that Indians are. These idiots are our professors and many guru’s in India and elsewhere.
Thus, we see that Ambedkar and the Ambedkarites (in India and elsewhere today) are total slaves of their western masters. To ‘convert’ from ‘Hinduism’ to ‘Buddhism’, as though they are conflicting religions, is to simply ape the western cretins who have been selling this story for nearly 200 years. Of course, the Ambedkarites do that because their fame and fortune depends on slavery. They would rather be slaves of cretins than live free as thinking human beings. The western ‘thinkers’ in the US fete them because they love the adulation and adoration they get from these Indians. And, as is the case with Pollock, they are “friends with benefits” with Indians:  getting millions of dollars from idiots like Narayan Murthy and receiving national awards from the Indian government.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Is Sat explainable?</title><link>https://yogirk.github.io/hipkapi/posts/is-real-explainable/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jan 2017 21:25:55 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://yogirk.github.io/hipkapi/posts/is-real-explainable/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;No, I cannot explain the real; nor has anybody else in the world. Even more radically: the Real can never be ‘explained’, nor will there be an explanatory theory, ever (that is what is meant by ‘providing an explanation’ or speak of explaining) about the real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, if the ‘Real’ comprises of “all these doctrines” then the Real is the world of ideas as distinct from the material and the mental world. Popper believed this to be the case, and called it the ‘third world’. You are, therefore, right on the spot when you call me ignorant. Yes, indeed, I did not know that Indians were Popperians &lt;em&gt;avant la letter&lt;/em&gt;: avant la letter, because Popper did it with a clarity and verve that Indians never attained. This is the second reason I do not want to wake up. ‘Awakening’ of the type you propagate is terribly depressing because the resultant ‘gyaanodaya’ is this: Buddha, Shankara, Ramanuja, Madva (to mention only a few names) merely “prepared” the advent of Sir Karl Popper, in exactly the same way all cultures in the world before Christ were merely ‘Praeparatione Evangelica’. I wish you, who appears to be a disciple of this new ‘praeparatione’ (the famous ‘Second Coming’?), the best of luck.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Translating vibhaktis</title><link>https://yogirk.github.io/hipkapi/posts/translating-vibhaktis/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Jan 2017 22:06:11 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://yogirk.github.io/hipkapi/posts/translating-vibhaktis/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The problem is more complicated and the implications far more massive than either of us can even dream of. In fact, I think we are not even aware of the nature, size and the dimensions of the problem(s) today. We do not even know whether we are dealing with something called the ‘translation’ problem or whole sets of other issues and problems that also redefine what it is to ‘translate’ texts between different cultures.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Real vs. Existence</title><link>https://yogirk.github.io/hipkapi/posts/real-vs-existence/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Apr 2012 09:46:21 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://yogirk.github.io/hipkapi/posts/real-vs-existence/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;With some justifiable distortion, one can claim that the Indian Adhyatmic traditions revolve partially around some &amp;lsquo;philosophical&amp;rsquo; questions: what is real and what is existence? Is there a distinction between the two and, if yes, how to draw that line? This is a distortion because the debate never took this form; it is justifiable nonetheless to present it this way because it gives us a handle to tackle them today. However, we need to note that this is our way of posing the question, not theirs. Therefore, whether or not &amp;ldquo;believing&amp;rdquo; in Rama or Krishna entails the existence of such entities requires clarity about notions like &amp;rsquo;existence&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;belief&amp;rsquo; in the Indian traditions. I do not have this clarity and, only recently, I was told that the Indian intellectual traditions (in Sanskrit) do not have a word for &amp;lsquo;belief&amp;rsquo;. (It is as yet unclear to me what this implies: does it have the same force as the statement that Indians did not have a word for &amp;lsquo;gravitation&amp;rsquo; either or whether the notion of knowledge that we have is different from what we think knowledge is today.) Consequently, I cannot say much about this discussion today.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Avidya, Ajnana, Maaya, Ignorance: a learning process</title><link>https://yogirk.github.io/hipkapi/posts/avidya-ajnana-ignorance-a-learning-process-s-n-balagangadhara/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Mar 2011 09:17:52 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://yogirk.github.io/hipkapi/posts/avidya-ajnana-ignorance-a-learning-process-s-n-balagangadhara/</guid><description>&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we speak about ignorance, we can do so in two ways. One is by talking about &amp;lsquo;how the world is&amp;rsquo;; the other is by talking about &amp;lsquo;how we think the world is&amp;rsquo;. Even though we could use both ways to characterize &amp;lsquo;ignorance&amp;rsquo;, they are not coextensive (or synonyms) because (a) they are about different things – in the first case it is about the world; in the second case it is about what we take to exist in the world – and, therefore, (b) they have different consequences.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Is ‘sat’ ‘being’? S.N.Balagangadhara</title><link>https://yogirk.github.io/hipkapi/posts/is-sat-being-s-n-balagangadhara/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Mar 2011 03:58:08 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://yogirk.github.io/hipkapi/posts/is-sat-being-s-n-balagangadhara/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;To take German language, let us look at how Heidegger talks about &amp;lsquo;being&amp;rsquo;: there is the &amp;lsquo;big Being&amp;rsquo; (&amp;lsquo;Sein&amp;rsquo;) and there is the &amp;lsquo;small being&amp;rsquo; (&amp;lsquo;Dasein&amp;rsquo; meaning &amp;rsquo;there-being&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;so-being&amp;rsquo;). And then there is &amp;lsquo;Sein&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;Seindes&amp;rsquo;. All these are translated by the word &amp;lsquo;being&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To jump back a couple of hundred years, and pick up another philosopher with the same alphabet and the same language, we have G.W.F. Hegel. His &amp;lsquo;Sein&amp;rsquo; of course has nothing to do with the &amp;lsquo;Sein&amp;rsquo; of Heidegger, even though both are translated as &amp;lsquo;Being&amp;rsquo; with a big B. So, even in one language, there are problems with respect to translating words into another language.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
