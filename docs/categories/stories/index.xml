      <title>Ontology of Jain authors: Ramayana</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am not sure what the discussions are about. Here are some of the problems that have surfaced.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Do (did) people in India believe that Ramayana is (was) a narration of &amp;lsquo;what really happened&amp;rsquo;? Even without specifying the &amp;lsquo;when&amp;rsquo; and the &amp;lsquo;where&amp;rsquo;, the answer is obvious: some (did) do; some (did) do not; some are agnostic. The question, however, is: What is the question about? What problem is it meant to solve? Does the answer I give solve any problem? If it does not, that shows that this is not the issue at stake. So, what is the issue then?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Can we talk about truth in Fiction? (The example of Holmes.) Yes, we can and do so very regularly, not only in common parlance but also in literary studies. However, the issues are: how should we understand this way of talking (there is controversy about it) and why is this relevant to Ramayana?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Did some Indians begin a discussion about the existence of Ramasethu and the temple of Rama in Ayodhya (of today) only relatively recently? Yes, I think so. I do not know of any discussion that occurred on this issue, say, a thousand years ago. Again, what is the problem?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Did Indians have no notion of the &amp;rsquo;truth of Ramayana&amp;rsquo; before their contact with non-heathen cultures? This is an ill-formed question, as far as I am concerned, because it is unclear what counts as an answer. Equally, it is unclear what the question is about: (a) is it about the Indian notions of &amp;rsquo;truth&amp;rsquo;? (b) is it about the &amp;rsquo;truth&amp;rsquo; of historiography? (c) Is it about the relation between &amp;lsquo;belief about the truth of historiography&amp;rsquo; and the &amp;rsquo;truth of historiography&amp;rsquo; independent of people&amp;rsquo;s beliefs about its truth?&#xA;These are merely some of the questions that have surfaced. May I request that we resume the threads with clear problem statements so that we can make some headway?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;II&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Interpretations</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are multiple kinds of interpretation. For instance, there is interpretation of symbols in a domain like Physics: μ (in elementary optics) is &amp;ldquo;interpreted&amp;rdquo; as the refraction index of a substance. We use a more or less analogous notion of &amp;ldquo;interpretation&amp;rdquo; in Chemistry, Mathematics and so on. In logic, we speak of &amp;ldquo;interpretation of variables&amp;rdquo; like &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;, etc. Here, it means that the letters stand-in for arbitrary sentences with truth-values.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Historiography and Myths</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/hipkapi/posts/historiography-and-myths/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/hipkapi/posts/historiography-and-myths/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The western intellectual tradition has bemoaned the fact that the Indians never indulged in history-writing (or historiography). In this tradition, there is an obsessive need for collecting &amp;ldquo;facts&amp;rdquo; about the past. This is partly the result of how Judaism, Christianity and Islam (the three Semitic religions) look at themselves and their own past: everything they claim about their past (the Flood, the temple of Solomon, the coming of Christ, etc.) should not only be true but proven so beyond all doubt. They have to be true (in the sense that their recounting of the past should also be confirmed by research) because these religions live or die accordingly as whether it is also true what they say effectively happened on earth. These facts (like the existence of, say, the Temple of Solomon in the Israel of today and the Judea of yesterday or the existence of Jesus of Nazareth), in their turn, prove the truth about Moses and his tablet and the truth of the promise of God to the children of Israel. If the recounting of their past turns out to be false (like, say, the absence of any of the above two) would destroy their existence: if there was never a historical Jesus of Nazareth, Christianity would collapse like a house of cards. (In fact, Julian the Apostate, the nephew of the Emperor Constantine, set out to rebuild the Temple of Solomon at its original site precisely in order to do this. His early death, viewed both by the Jews and the Christians as an act of God, put an end to this project.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Let me begin with the following dialogue between a Swiss-German and a young Balinese (from Bichsel, Peter, &lt;em&gt;Der Leser, Das Erzählen: Frankfurter Poetik-Vorlesungen&lt;/em&gt;, 1982, Darmstadt und Neuwied: Hermann Luchterhand Verlag. Pp. 13-14, my translation and italics):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I discovered, or when it was explained to me, that Hinduism is a pedagogical religion, namely, that in so far as the best “good deed” of a Hindu consisted of explaining something or the other, I lost my inhibitions and began with questions&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What do Indians Need: A History or the Past--S.N.Balagangadhara</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, both in India and abroad, we see the emergence of a new intellectual trend: based on painstaking research, to write an accurate history of India. What is &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; about this approach? In one sense, as I shall explain in this article, this attempt is not novel; in another sense, which too shall be explained, there is something very new in it. I shall talk about both in the course of answering the question raised in the title, which contrasts ‘the past’ with ‘a history’. This contrast needs explication because historiography is seen as an ‘accurate recording of the past’. Yet, I am going to contrast the product of historiography, ‘a history’, with something called ‘the past’.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Creation stories: Christianity vs. Indian traditions</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/hipkapi/posts/creation-stories-christianity-vs-indian-traditions/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 06 Apr 2011 20:28:40 +0530</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/hipkapi/posts/creation-stories-christianity-vs-indian-traditions/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Of course there are any number of stories in other cultures, &amp;lsquo;Hinduism&amp;rsquo; included, about the creation of the world and what happened ever since. However, not every story about the creation of the world (let us stick to these kind of stories) has the quality of making the world &amp;rsquo;the Cosmos, that is&amp;rsquo; into an explanatorily intelligible entity. The Big-Bang theory is also a story about the creation of the world, but again, it misses the quality of the story told by religions, i.e. what &lt;em&gt;explains&lt;/em&gt; the Cosmos is also what makes it &lt;em&gt;intelligible&lt;/em&gt;. Or, as the Christians say: it was God&amp;rsquo;s will to create the world and His will was also the cause of the world&amp;rsquo;s existence. (Other dispositions attributed to God, such as His perfect goodness, etc. are important too, but I will ignore them here.) Given this, it is not clear to me what point you are trying to make. If it is your claim that the many stories in India are equivalent to the Biblical story in Christianity, you are wrong. This is exactly the assumption that was made by the missionaries when they confronted &amp;lsquo;Hinduism&amp;rsquo;. The only difference is that, then, they were attacked as being &amp;lsquo;false&amp;rsquo; and that, now, they are hailed for expressing the beauty of the Indian &amp;lsquo;faith&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Stories and intelligibility</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/hipkapi/posts/stories-and-intelligibility/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 25 Mar 2011 23:56:25 +0530</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/hipkapi/posts/stories-and-intelligibility/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;(I) In a Greek story, Persephone spends part of the year in the underworld and part of the year on earth, and winter is caused by her mother Demeter&amp;rsquo;s sorrow at parting, and spring by her mother&amp;rsquo;s joy at reuniting. When taken at face value, this story makes the change of seasons be because of someone&amp;rsquo;s emotions, and hence intelligible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Two points with respect to this. (a) I do not think that the story itself would say that winter and spring were &lt;em&gt;caused&lt;/em&gt; by the emotions of the mother. Instead, it would say: &amp;ldquo;her sorrow became, her joy became…&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;thus her sorrow is, her joy is…&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;that is how seasons came into being&amp;rdquo; or some such formulation. That is because, in my view, this story &lt;em&gt;does not&lt;/em&gt; portray causal or other relations between events. That is why it remains beautiful to this day. (b) Here, you are using &amp;lsquo;intelligibility&amp;rsquo; as &amp;lsquo;understandability&amp;rsquo;. Having or experiencing emotions is not seen as an &lt;em&gt;intentional&lt;/em&gt; state, i.e., not as a propositional attitude. &amp;lsquo;He is sad because his mother died&amp;rsquo; is glossed as &amp;lsquo;he believes that he is sad because his mother died&amp;rsquo;, or as &amp;lsquo;he is sad because he believes that his mother died&amp;rsquo;. (One indicator for testing the role played by the &amp;rsquo;that&amp;rsquo; clause is: the truth value of the entire sentence does not get affected by the truth value of the sentence occurring after the &amp;rsquo;that&amp;rsquo; clause. That is, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/hipkapi/posts/intentional-operator-and-inconsistent-reasoning/&#34;&gt;&amp;rsquo;that&amp;rsquo; clause is not truth-functional&lt;/a&gt;&#xA; unlike say &amp;lsquo;or&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;and&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;if…then&amp;rsquo; clauses.) It is important to emphasize that the notion of &amp;lsquo;intelligibility&amp;rsquo; requires that it is an expression of an intentional state and emotions are not seen as intentional states.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Vacuity of NRIs and their symbolic interpretations</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/hipkapi/posts/vacuity-of-nris-and-their-symbolic-interpretations/</link>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Vyasa&amp;rsquo;s argument (to the extent we can speak of an argument in this context) is quite subtle: When Urvasi comes to Arjuna at the behest of his father, and when she is possessed by desire, and when the Apsaras choose freely and unconfined, then (a) one cannot reject her; (b) and with the argument that she is a superior to him. If you split this conjunction and cast in normative terms, it says something like this: (a) Rejection of a woman is not permitted when one&amp;rsquo;s father indicates that a son should sleep with a woman; (b) Rejection of a woman is not permitted when the woman is sexually attracted to oneself; (c) Rejection of a woman, whoever she might be, is not permitted when she chooses freely and without confines. Because such a rejection is triply prohibited (or forbidden), Arjuna&amp;rsquo;s argument that he &amp;lsquo;ought not&amp;rsquo; to sleep with the parent of his race (which has only one prohibition) possesses less value. So, Urvasi is justified in her curse of Arjuna. In other words, if we read this fragment of Mahabharata in normative terms, Arjuna was wrong in not having an incestuous relationship with one of his great-great-grandparents.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1&amp;rsquo;. While one could argue that one &amp;lsquo;ought not&amp;rsquo; to sleep with the &amp;lsquo;superiors&amp;rsquo;, Urvasi suggests that because she has chosen freely, this argument is void. On top of saying why Arjuna is wrong to reject sleeping with her, she also comes up with two other reasons why he could sleep with her: (a) Arjuna&amp;rsquo;s ancestors have done so and without committing any &amp;lsquo;sin&amp;rsquo;; therefore, it is &amp;lsquo;permissible&amp;rsquo; that he does the same; (b)  it is a morally good thing to emulate one&amp;rsquo;s ancestors and therefore Arjuna &amp;lsquo;ought to&amp;rsquo; sleep with her.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Indian culture’s attitude toward sex vs. Christian Morality</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/hipkapi/posts/indian-cultures-attitude-toward-sex-vs-christian-morality/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 23 Mar 2011 07:14:18 +0530</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/hipkapi/posts/indian-cultures-attitude-toward-sex-vs-christian-morality/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Let us begin with the assumption that our stories about Indra and the Gandharvas are just that: stories, authored by human beings, without truth-content. (That is to say, they are neither true nor false.) When human beings write stories, their imagination is (partially) constrained by their societies, cultures and the times they live in. None quite knows how exactly the latter constrain human imagination even though the extant theories about myths try to explicate this relation: some see in them a mirroring of society, some see in them a disguised historiography or sociology, some see in them a personification of virtues, and so on. Because this issue is not settled yet, I shall presuppose the truth of none of the theories about myths that dot the landscape. However, I take the &amp;lsquo;constraint&amp;rsquo; I spoke about to incorporate the following minimal claim: the myths suggest that some attitudes fall within the limits (or transgress them, as the case may be) of the cultures whose myths they are. Under this assumption, let me isolate some of the attitudes that come to the fore if we look at our stories about apsaras.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Are stories symbols?</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/hipkapi/posts/are-stories-symbols/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 23 Mar 2011 03:11:35 +0530</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/hipkapi/posts/are-stories-symbols/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;1. Here is one way of looking at what stories are. They are symbols. What are they symbols of? Well, they could symbolize acts; they could also be symbolically interpreted as justifications of such acts. Under this construal, a story requires an interpretation: one has to interpret the story as a symbol of either an act or as its symbolic justification. (The same applies to looking at stories as symbols of values. The stories, for instance, could be seen to symbolize virtues. Stories could also symbolize passions, feelings, natural forces&amp;hellip;) Then, stories are mostly, if not always, symbols of something or another. When you look at the issue this way, it is almost akin to saying that stories are &amp;ldquo;evidences&amp;rdquo; of sorts: some story or another provides &amp;ldquo;evidence&amp;rdquo; about the presence of &amp;ldquo;something else&amp;rdquo;. (Let us leave aside the issue of what it means to talk of a symbol in all these contexts or what &amp;ldquo;evidence&amp;rdquo; means here. Both terms can be understood in a vague sense for our purposes.) In another language, we can say that all stories are signs. These signs must be turned into signifiers (this requires an act of interpretation) by showing or suggesting that they signify &amp;ldquo;something else&amp;rdquo; (called the signified).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Explanations that trivialize experiences</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/hipkapi/posts/explanations-that-trivialize-experiences-s-n-balagangadhara/</link>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In many cultures, especially in the Indian case, it is important to understand that stories are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; explanations. They are neither true nor false because they do not describe &amp;lsquo;factual&amp;rsquo; events; they do not claim that they do either. Unlike the Bible, the Puranas do not have to be true or known to be true for them to play the role they do in the Indian culture. The Indian myths neither allegorize virtues nor are they &amp;lsquo;disguised&amp;rsquo; histories. In other words, the presuppositions of your question (common ones in the western scholarship since the Enlightenment) are &lt;em&gt;false&lt;/em&gt; and based on ignorance about the genre of the myth and the roles they play. (I can only assert these claims having argued them &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/hipkapi/posts/comparative-anthropology-and-action-sciences-an-essay-on-knowing-to-act-and-acting-to-know-s-n-balagangadhara/&#34;&gt;elsewhere.&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;[ &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.philosophica.ugent.be/article/82484/galley/202298/view/&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Original&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;, published  &lt;em&gt;Philosophica&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;40&lt;/strong&gt; (2): 77–107]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Introduction&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Should action sciences exist, it is obvious what they would have to study; the nature of human action, the kind of knowledge that actions generate, the process of learning to perform different types of action and so forth. Comparative anthropology, as a discipline, studies and contrasts, where such contrasts are possible, the different ways in which human beings organize their lives, think about and experience both themselves and world around them. A culture is a form of life and, as such, it is a way of going about the world. One would therefore expect to find a deep and intimate relation between action sciences on the one hand, and studies of culture on the other. A perusal of literature, however, shows the fact of the matter to be different.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The past and ways of talking about it</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/hipkapi/posts/the-past-and-ways-of-talking-about-it/</link>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;What is history? In the first place, it is the subject matter of historiography, which is what historians write. What does historiography talk about? The human past. In other words, there is a distinction to be made between &amp;rsquo;the past&amp;rsquo; and ways of talking about this past.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If this distinction (between &amp;rsquo;the past&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;ways of talking about it&amp;rsquo;) is accepted, then we can answer the question about what history is thus: it is a way of talking about the past&amp;ndash;a &amp;lsquo;scientific&amp;rsquo; way. That is, the truths of historiography are established using the methods and techniques widely accepted in that domain.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The past can be talked about not only by using historiographical methods, but also in different ways: the way stories, legends, drama, poetry, etc do. These are also ways of talking of the past but they lay no claims to being histories (or they do not claim to be &amp;lsquo;historiographies&amp;rsquo;).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;What is the status of the Bible? According to the Semitic religions, not only is it the word of God, but it also aspires to being &amp;lsquo;historiography&amp;rsquo;. Events like the revelation of the Biblical god, the covenant this god made with the people of Israel, the existence of Jesus of Nazareth, his claims to being the Christ, and such like are claimed to be not &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; events in the human past but, above all, as &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt; events. That is, they claim to be &lt;em&gt;historical events&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Symbolic interpretation of lingam from a netizen&lt;/strong&gt;: &amp;ldquo;In ancient India, there was a fertility cult; our ancestors &lt;em&gt;knew&lt;/em&gt; that it was a fertility cult; Lingam was a symbol for the phallus then; it continues to be one even when many millions are ignorant of this now; and that the Modern Indians&amp;rsquo; attitude to sex is inhibiting because of which they do not see the symbolism.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To keep the contrast between us stark, here is what I say: Lingam is not a symbol of anything or anybody. Lingam is &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; Shiva&amp;rsquo;s puja is done (as against, say, how we do puja to Vishnu) by the Indians. You tell me that this &lt;em&gt;factual claim&lt;/em&gt; is wrong and that by saying what I have just said, I project my present to &amp;rsquo;explain&amp;rsquo; the past. Very well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Is Rain dance superstitious?—Willem Derde</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/hipkapi/posts/is-rain-dance-superstitious-willem-derde/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 01 Mar 2011 04:00:44 +0530</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/hipkapi/posts/is-rain-dance-superstitious-willem-derde/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some consider it to be a &amp;ldquo;superstitious practice&amp;rdquo;, the implication being that it is irrational to believe that dancing &lt;em&gt;causes&lt;/em&gt; the rain to fall: no reasonable people on earth can buy the story that dancing actually causes rain to fall. I am not willing to buy it. However, it is a fact that in some cultures people &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; perform &amp;lsquo;rain dances&amp;rsquo;. However, to explain the &amp;lsquo;rain dance&amp;rsquo; by attributing a &amp;lsquo;causative story&amp;rsquo; is to trivialize such an experience: &lt;em&gt;you are transforming the members of that group into a bunch of idiots.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
