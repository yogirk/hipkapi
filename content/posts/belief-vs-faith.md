(a) It appears to me that in these discussions, a very vital issue (if we want to talk about Judaism, Christianity and Islam, and their 'problems' with 'Hinduism', etc) is not being recognized. and that is this: religious 'beliefs' are not accorded their place, and are talked about as though they are merely a subset of the class of 'beliefs'.

(b) 'Being a believer' (I will confine myself to Christianity for the sake of brevity) does *not* mean assenting to the proposition that 'God exists'. For, if this is what it would mean, then the Devil himself is the first believer: after all, he does accept it as true that God exists. (The Devil is not an atheist, mind you.) He knows that God exists: after all, he rebelled against him! As the new testament Bible puts it: "thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble." (James 2: 26)

(c) Throughout the history of Christianity, all versions have repeatedly emphasized this difference between assenting to a proposition (that 'God exists', for example), and believing *in* God. At random, here is how Martin Luther talks about the difference between the two: "observe, there are two ways of believing. In the first place I may have faith *concerning* God. This is the case when I hold to be true what is said concerning God. Such faith is on the same level with the assent I give to statements concerning the Turk, the Devil and Hell. A faith of this kind should be called knowledge or information rather than faith. In the second place there is faith *in* God. Such a faith is mine when I not only hold to be true what is said concerning God, but when I put my trust *in* Him in such a way as to enter into personal relations with Him, believing firmly that I shall find Him to be and to do as I have been taught... the word *in* is well chosen and deserving of due attention. We do not say, I believe God the father or concerning God the father, but *in* God the father, *in* Jesus Christ, and *in* the holy spirit." (as in Luther's Catechetical Writings, trans., Lenker, J.N. in 2 volumes. Minneapolis: Luther press, 1907, vol.1: 203. italics by Luther.)

(d) In other words, to speak about 'tolerance' of those who have 'different beliefs' is one thing; to use the same when talking about religions is something else altogether.

(e) Judaism, Christianity and Islam (according to them) believe *in* 'God'; and that, even though we believe that 'God exists', we believe *in* the devil. (These are our 'gods': Laxmi, Vishnu, Perumal, Guruvayoorappan, Rama, Shiva, etc.)

(f) This is why they want to 'convert' us so that we may also believe *in* God and cease believing *in* the devil.

(g) Perhaps, we can avoid a great deal of wasted energy (by talking about 'secularism' and 'tolerance' and such like) if we tried to reformulate our problems in this manner
