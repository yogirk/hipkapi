Let me lay this fear to rest: I am *not* speaking for the community. To the question, 'Who speaks for the Indian traditions?' my reply is simple: *anyone, everyone, whoever feels like*. (Of course, I do not consider the question very sensible, but that is a side-issue for the moment.)

Having said this much, let me also say that my discussion with Jeffrey Kripal is not about the moral right to speak in the name of the community but whether such speeches *constitute knowledge*. In other words, I *evaluate* what someone says about the Indian traditions for its veracity and it is here that I find Kripal falling way short.
