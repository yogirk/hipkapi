> Here is how, rightly in my view, you formulate the challenge facing us:  So, the challenge you (and people like me who find your explanations very interesting) face is to figure out a comprehensive, viable and sustainable alternate ‘clustering structure’ (the modern complex organization) that will deliver the complex goods and services needed in today’s economy while getting rid of the cultural distortions which give rise to ‘corruption’.
> Here, then, is my invitation and the reason for extending it.
> (a) Are there people out there who are well-versed in Management theories (theory of firm, management control systems, organisational theory, etc) and sufficiently practical enough to undertake a medium to long-term research on the “relation between culture and management”? This research requires an intermeshing of the theories of organisation, my own studies on culture, and historical research into how public services were organised in India. Such research would help us develop an alternate “clustering structure”, as Arjun calls it.
> (b) If there are people out there well-versed in any of the above three areas and are willing to work along (either directly through participation or indirectly by facilitating others to undertake such a research), could you please get in touch with me off-line? We can have exchanges through the e-mail and we can meet up with each other sometime in April in the US to talk the concrete steps through. (I will be coming to the US in April.)
> (c) Such a research would enable us to develop not just an alternate description of India but also help evolving an alternate theory of organisation, which could get tested in practical life.
> (d) About my reason for extending the invitation. Not being a management specialist, it would take me at least a few years to become familiar with the extant theories about it. I simply do not have that time. I am willing, however, to work along and guide those who want to do research because I have \*already\* spent some time doing preliminary work on the subject. I am convinced that this is a gold-mine and I do believe that we will advance our understanding about the relation between culture and management (which every business manager confronts practically when he sets up business in India) in very interesting and concrete ways.
> Any takers?
