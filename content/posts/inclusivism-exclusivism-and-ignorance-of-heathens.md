Words like "inclusivism", "exclusivism" etc. are *not* a part of my terminology. They are not only imprecise but also misleading. They have been used mostly as meta-descriptions of the stance that Christian theologies took with respect to other *religions*. (To use these loaded notions, even when negatively qualified, to describe the Indian traditions is totally misleading and entirely wrong.) They are also useless to describe (in any accurate manner) the Christian religion because each of the above notions expresses a *specific solution* to the Christological dilemma. My discussion of Christianity *as a religion* is pitched at another level of abstraction than these notions permit.
