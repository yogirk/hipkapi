Many come up with criticisms like 'Buddhist logics are different' or 'one has to follow Indian logics'. These criticisms sound profound! They are damn shallow, unless they answer the following questions.
1. What is their structure?
2. What are their axioms?

3. What are their rules of inferences?

4. What are some some crucial meta-logical theorems (do they all have deduction theorems?) etc.
