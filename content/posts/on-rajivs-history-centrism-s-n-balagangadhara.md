Can history-centrism *cause* some religion or the other to be belief-based? The notion of "history-centrism" is too vague to allow a serious answer. In so far as this refers to a "Grand narrative", and this narrative is either an oral or a written account, it is a *candidate* for the status of 'belief'. Consequently, your question takes the following form: *Does "believing in" the truth of some or another historical event cause a religion to base itself on "beliefs"?* (The contrast term to "belief" will have to be attitude or action or event.) As Christians do, you might want to distinguish between "believing in" (a propositional attitude) and a set of "beliefs" (which are a set of propositions). In that case, the Christian stance is superior to your formulation: they say that *believing in* God is primary with respect to the belief that "God exists" or that "Christ has come" or any such thing.

Empirically speaking, has history-centrism caused some or another religion to be belief-based? An answer to this interpretation of your question depends on how you *write* history and whether one sees historical consciousness as a prerequisite for believing that some proposition is true. Frankly, I cannot quite see how such an epistemological claim (the latter part of the above sentence is an epistemological claim) can be argued.
