All works of Balagangadhara make use of [use-mention distinction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use%E2%80%93mention_distinction). Please get familiarized with this distinction.
In logic the words 'use' and 'mention' are sometimes used in a technical sense to mark an important distinction, which is explaind by example:

1. 'London' is a word six letters long.
2. London is a city.

In 1 the word 'London' is said to be mentioned; in 2 the word 'London' is said to be *used* (and not mentioned).
