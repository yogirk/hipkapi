The ascription of professional competence to oneself when one does not have that. Each is in a position to say what 'the Caste System' is, what 'ethics' is, what 'corruption' is, what 'religion' is, what 'Hinduism' is… Why does one need to build new social science, when 'every Hindu specimen' is an authority on these subjects? I suppose one can also be a physicist, biologist and chemist on these grounds as well: after all, is one not subject to gravitational forces, chemical reactions in the body, and suffers pain as well?

Please do not misconstrue what I write. It is no demand that everyone should have knowledge or shut up. The point is different: *you cannot learn, if you do not realize the depth of your ignorance.*
