1. Perhaps, one of the ways to test whether your search is taking you in the right direction is by seeing whether it solves a well-known paradox, or explicates it in a novel way. If after research, your hypothesis leads you to a well-known discussion in theology (but *lacks* the latter's sophistication), then you could be on an uninteresting track.

2. In certain phases of thinking, unbridled speculations have a serious contribution to make. After some time, it teaches one that there is a very interesting difference between [disciplined speculations and speculations of other sorts](/posts/arguments-vs-theories/) and that one has to learn the former. However, the only way to learn the former is through the latter.
