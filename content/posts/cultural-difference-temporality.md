Experiences are structured differently in different cultures. We believe that it is possible to give a *true* description of this difference, at some level or the other, *as*a difference regarding the *experience of time* itself. Consider the traditions of Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. One of the central notions in these traditions is that of *temporality*. That is, they believe that all events, processes, and objects are transient, irreversible, and fleeting. From this *experience* of transience and very few assumptions about human psychology, these traditions have quasi-derived some of the most fascinating doctrines that we know of. It is worthwhile to contrast these with Judeo-Christian traditions, where this kind of temporality plays no role. It is possible to explain the *actions* of people in these cultures, at some level of adequacy, by appealing to their conceptions and/or experiences of time. One can research on the question "does not *their*experience of transience play a causal role in the actions they perform?"
