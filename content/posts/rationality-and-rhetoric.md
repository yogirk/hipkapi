1. It is in the nature of a rhetorical text that the author uses linguistic 'tropes' (metaphors, similes, analogies, imagery, etc) to persuade a reader about the reasonableness of a specific standpoint. It does not build arguments that systematically lead to a stand point but instead tries to convince the readers (or listeners) by using the abilities built into natural languages. Such texts do not easily lend themselves to a discussion regarding the steps taken in developing a stand point, unlike, say, a mathematical proof or a philosophical argument. Of course, I do not find such texts 'irrational'.

2. One possibility is that you do not expect to encounter such emotions in a rational discussion between two intellectuals. While you would be right on this score up to a point, please reflect on the possibility that you are circumscribing 'rationality' very narrowly: in such a circumscription, 'rhetorics' would not be considered 'rational' any more than discussions involving a combination of what we Indians call 'rasa'. Taunts and teasing, humor and irony, sarcasm and ridicule, are as much parts of a rhetorical text as are praise and laudations. That is why I did not make the remark that Hogan's text was a *laudatio* but used that character of his text to enter into a 'discussion', which, I admit, failed.

3. The idea that scientific theories should not use rhetorical strategies is something that no intellectual who knows anything about the relevant domains accepts. In a time when cognitive science, historians of science are studying the role that analogies, metaphors, and other linguistic tropes play in the process of *scientific discovery* (leave alone the propaganda of science), this idea belongs to yesteryears.

*Note*: When I say 'rhetorical', I do not mean anything pejorative; 'Rhetorics' was the general name for the art of persuasion and argument for nearly 2000 years in the West. Even to this day, in high schools in some European countries, a subject called 'Rhetorica' is taught to young people.
