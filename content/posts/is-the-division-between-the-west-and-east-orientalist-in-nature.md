Is the division between the West and East Orientalist in nature? Well, that is what Edward Said says in his Orientalism; that is what many writers in his wake say too. I beg to disagree. Let me make but three points. One: that there is an Indian culture and a western culture has been established in my book. (Of course, it is also an experiential given.) Consequently, I have just presumed this distinction here. Second: some distinction does not become Orientalist just because the Orientalist thinkers use the distinction. Thirdly: that there exist empirical distinctions of culture etc. is not *denied* by Edward Said but only that speaking about these distinctions leads to violence. A rather funny stance, to say the least.
