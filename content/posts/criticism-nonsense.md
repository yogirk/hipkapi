*Regarding nonsense.* I take it you mean that my claims are false or wrong. In that case, I would like to read your reasons. There is no point in simply saying something like that without telling which *other theory of religion* does better than mine. Even if there are problems in my theory, I claim that this is the best theory we have in the market place. If you think differently, I would like you to tell us *the way in which* any of the competitor theories in the market place does better. Of course, as a scientist, I do know (and accept) at a meta-level that all my claims are *hypothetical and tentative.* I very honestly hope to see and greet, before I die, a *much better theory* of religion than the one I am developing. Such a process will come into being, if people like you discuss the theory in a critical but rational way. It will not, if people continue nit-picking and come up with irrelevant criticisms.
